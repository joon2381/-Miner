RT,오징어 게임 시즌 1,Squid Game Season 1,2021,positive,12/13/2021,It's not the kind of apocalypse story that longs for hopeful human resilience; it's most eloquent on the topics of financial despondence and weaponized nostalgia.

RT,오징어 게임 시즌 1,Squid Game Season 1,2021,negative,10/09/2021,"The low-effort concept [and] the pastel palette freckled with blood, Squid Game is a shallow story that uses a social issue as a platform for shocking violence. Yawn."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 1,Squid Game Season 1,2021,negative,10/09/2021,"Like Joker, there's a having-it-both-ways insistence that a culture that could create violence is inherently sick and deranged, while playing out a wildly overstated version of sick derangement in a manner designed to be maximally tense and amusing."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 1,Squid Game Season 1,2021,positive,10/08/2021,Hwang Dong-hyuk has done a great job of bringing this ghoulishly entertaining series to life

RT,오징어 게임 시즌 1,Squid Game Season 1,2021,positive,10/06/2021,"As social commentary, it mostly works. As a show about brutal, larger-than-life games to the death, it also mostly works... But as far as final acts go, Squid Game stumbled pretty badly."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 1,Squid Game Season 1,2021,positive,10/06/2021,"What writer-director Hwang Dong-hyuk has done principally involves serving old wine in a new bottle. Seen that way, ""Squid Game"" presents a visually arresting variation on themes seen plenty of times before, which include tapping into the class divide."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 1,Squid Game Season 1,2021,positive,10/05/2021,[It] never makes its action look glamorous. Its intensity comes from feeling that you've gone beyond the end point of a chain of absurdist logic and you really might not want to see what comes next.

RT,오징어 게임 시즌 1,Squid Game Season 1,2021,positive,10/05/2021,"Debt to a cruel system is inescapable and dehumanizing, the show constantly reminds us.

RT,오징어 게임 시즌 1,Squid Game Season 1,2021,positive,10/03/2021,"It does say a lot about human nature, friendship, cruelty, and the way modern societies have abused its poorer citizens. [Full review in Spanish]"
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 1,Squid Game Season 1,2021,negative,10/03/2021,"The greater anticapitalist critique of Squid Game almost entirely toothless following any serious analysis...I am unimpressed with the messaging, and am confident this drama won't stand the test of time."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 1,Squid Game Season 1,2021,positive,10/02/2021,"A twisty, fast-paced, action-packed show whose episodes end in killer cliffhangers-in other words, the ultimate binge bait."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 1,Squid Game Season 1,2021,positive,10/02/2021,Netflix's Korean thriller is on track to be the most watched series in the streamer's history. It's also giving people nightmares.
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 1,Squid Game Season 1,2021,positive,10/02/2021,"As far as sociopolitical statements go, you also couldn't engineer a better strike to the millennial and Gen Z nerves than a show where characters have to perform useless tasks in order to marginally improve their luck of the draw."

RT,오징어 게임 시즌 1,Squid Game Season 1,2021,positive,10/02/2021,"This unflinching look at how desperation changes us makes Squid Game as moving as it is exciting. It searches for an answer to one terrifying question: When pushed, what are your limits? What would you do? Its chilling brutality has us hooked."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 1,Squid Game Season 1,2021,positive,10/02/2021,"Equal parts gut-wrenching and squirm-inducing, it's a white-knuckle thriller, drama, and episodic psychological breakdown with a sickly pastel veneer. It's one of the most unique things you'll watch this year -- and maybe ever."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 1,Squid Game Season 1,2021,positive,10/02/2021,"Squid Game culminates emotionally in episode six, centered on a childlike game of marbles that's paced with excruciating slowness as the main characters have to make, literally, life or death decisions with one another."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 1,Squid Game Season 1,2021,positive,10/01/2021,The human aspect of this show shines over the morbid. For some reason we are addicted to the unmeasured violence and the isolation and behavioral analysis of human beings in movies and TV shows. Recipe for success. [Full review in Spanish]
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 1,Squid Game Season 1,2021,positive,10/01/2021,"Ignore some glaring red herrings, plot holes, occasional shoddy pacing and in-your-face gore, and Squid Game is worth bingeing."

RT,오징어 게임 시즌 1,Squid Game Season 1,2021,positive,10/01/2021,"Squid Game marks its own territory, first with its especially savage premise and the constant tension around life-or-death scenarios, and second, by focusing on each character's decisions, as they struggle to choose between survival and humanity."

RT,오징어 게임 시즌 1,Squid Game Season 1,2021,positive,09/21/2021,"Squid Game doesn't offer an escape from the horrors of the real world; within its limitations as a fictional drama, it gives us something far rarer: an affirmation that they exist, and that we're not alone in finding them nightmarish."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 1,Squid Game Season 1,2021,positive,09/21/2021,"Overall, this is still a savagely entertaining slam dunk from Netflix Korea, which is likely to be embraced around the world as its predecessors were."

RT,오징어 게임 시즌 1,Squid Game Season 1,2021,positive,09/17/2021,"Aside from being stretched just a touch too thin in spots, I'd say [Squid Game] deserves all the praise it's going to get."

RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,positive,Jul 16,"It hammers home that the lives of the poor are of little individual value to the powers that be. For all of the horror of being shot while playing a children’s game, the real horror is that surviving doesn’t give you any value."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,positive,Jun 19,"I should note that ""rehash"" is not a word I use necessarily pejoratively. Every character except Gi-hun has no idea how the game works, so redoing the Young-hee gauntlet allows the second season of Squid Game to explore the idea from a new hypothetical."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,positive,Apr 3,"If everyone insists on going Squid Game crazy while blatantly ignoring its central critique, then Squid Game season two will be about how delusional people really can be while the truth firmly and repeatedly slaps them in the face."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,positive,Jan 31,"The boat subplot aside, S02 is nearly as good as the first. Gi-hun's morals slipping under In-ho's influence is compelling and the new games, particularly the Pentathlon, are incredibly exciting. Bonus points for Gong Yoo's villainous turn"
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,negative,Jan 26,"This time around, though, something’s off. The characters are painfully one-dimensional, less real people than symbols."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,positive,Jan 25,"“Squid Game” has gone the way of the Hollywood blockbuster. A little louder, a little less interesting, but also fundamentally entertaining, even if it sometimes feels like leftovers."

RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,positive,Jan 23,"An electric, sophomore season that evokes Season 1's greatness while adding new levels of tension, danger, stress, mystery and terror. The acting, direction, set design, and writing are top notch and the new games will leave you cheering...and screaming!"

RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,positive,Jan 14,"Although there are no major surprises, [Squid Game Season 2] achieves a worthy continuation on par with its predecessor, establishing itself as a story that is as entertaining as it is socially disturbing. [Full review in Spanish]"
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,negative,Jan 10,"Instead of building, Jun-ho’s plot languishes. Gi-hun’s arc gets blurry. Worst of all, the antagonist remains a cipher."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,positive,Jan 9,"…it's exciting to see Squid Game back in action,…but it still doesn't avoid falling into the repetition of its formula. [Full review in Spanish]"
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,negative,Jan 9,Squid Game has cannibalized its original messaging and overstayed its welcome.
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,positive,Jan 8,Even a somewhat diminished Squid Game remains a wildly compelling TV show. Hwang has a rare commitment to taking the hardest questions his themes give rise to and putting them squarely at the center of the series.
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,positive,Jan 7,"Like the players in the deadly games that make up the show itself, the second season of Netflix's ""Squid Game"" was faced with a daunting challenge."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,positive,Jan 7,"The sensation that Squid Game created when it first launched was far beyond anything that anyone could have predicted. And with season two, it will definitely blow audiences away once again."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,positive,Jan 7,Somehow this season stays entertaining by continuing to tap into how we all at times feel like the world is becoming more of a predatory game.
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,positive,Jan 4,"[...] season 2 had a lot to prove. It had to honor the first season but stand out. It also had to elevate the game, the plot, and make us want to watch season 3. It did all of that and more. And it did it without falling into a sophomore slump."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,positive,Jan 4,"Though I am not going to rewatch the first season for comparison, because life is short, my impression is that the new season has more of an emphasis on interpersonal relationships (good and bad) and team dynamics."

RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,positive,Jan 4,"While it's a little long – at seven episodes, it's two episodes shorter than the last series, but some of the repetitive voting and gun-fight scenes can drag... it's a highly welcome return to this hellscape world."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,positive,Jan 4,"Despite its flaws, this (half) season is so effectively made that I’m willing to trust Hwang Dong-hyuk to tie it all together in season three."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,positive,Jan 3,"It’s well-made, nicely acted and retains at least some of the suspense of its imaginative predecessor. But the shine – and, indeed, the charm – is beginning to wear off."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,positive,Jan 3,"Hwang Dong-hyuk’s command of all this is mostly supreme. Squid Game’s critique of cutthroat capitalism is unwavering, with a particular focus on the illusion of free choice for those whose options are virtually nil."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,positive,Jan 3,"... Every time they cut away from the games to, like, this boat situation, it was a bore. I also don’t like that the season has no resolution."

RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,positive,Dec 31,"With Squid Game Season 2, the series weaves new threads and deepens returning characters. The Netflix series remains a brilliant use of genre to dig into deeper societal woes."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,positive,Dec 31,"Much of ""Squid Game"" feels familiar and the more disturbingly violent and outlandish seven-episode second season gets off to a bit of a slow start. But the show remains mostly a thrilling ride."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,negative,Dec 31,"Sadly, the long-awaited Squid Game Season 2 falls short with its pacing and new mechanics. In the world of Squid Game, preventing the sophomore slump may be the hardest game of all."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,negative,Dec 30,Squid Game 2 turned out to be a massive disappointment from every perspective.
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,positive,Dec 29,"The games are different and the people are frequently crueler, injecting what could have been a familiar retread with a greater punch as we observe Gi-hun trying to stop the brutality that surrounds him."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,positive,Dec 29,"If you loved season one of Squid Game, there’s enough here to hold your interest this time around, although I suspect you’ll also feel a bit less emotionally invested in the story."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,negative,Dec 29,"Season 2 comes off as a shell of the show's excellent former self, desperately trying to manufacture and revamp all the elements that made it an unexpected and fascinating cultural phenomenon."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,positive,Dec 28,"“Squid Game” is undeniably well-made in terms of craft, sharply directed in all seven episodes by the same creator, giving it a visual continuity that helps make it so bingeable."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,positive,Dec 28,"Deeply disturbing, ultraviolent and offering new insights, Squid Game Season 2 is a worthy follow-up expanding on the ominous themes of its predecessor."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,negative,Dec 28,"With every effort to dial up an element from Season 1, be it the voting mechanic or the Front Man's role, Squid Game Season 2 weakens its own mystique and appeal."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,positive,Dec 28,"By mid-season, the twists and turns will be coming so fast, you won’t be able to look away until the final, devastating, flourish. Let the new games begin."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,positive,Dec 28,"The long-anticipated second season of Squid Game lives up to what Hwang Dong-hyuk accomplished in the first season, with Gi-hun back in the game, but for very different reasons than when he first played it."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,positive,Dec 28,"If anything, Squid Game Season 2’s uneven seven-episode stretch closes itself out with a cliffhanger that might just be worth the watch. It’s simply too bad the season couldn’t offer much more than that."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,negative,Dec 28,"[The] intrigue compensates somewhat for the been-there, flinched-at-that feeling of the actual game. We’ve walked those Escher-like pastel staircases before, and the shock value has diminished in the long time between seasons."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,positive,Dec 28,…The series does not radically depart from the established formula. It skims the surface of the Squid Game world when you want it to dive deeper and show us something new.

RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,positive,Dec 28,"This time around, the drama and the brutality are dialed all the way up. The games are different, bloodier and deadlier. And the people playing them add an interesting new level of complexity."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,positive,Dec 28,"And though the shock value of the first series has inevitably been diluted, the sophomore season swaps cheap thrills for a more nuanced depiction of what good and bad means in a world where people kill each other in pursuit of money."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,negative,Dec 28,"The new episodes are still well-crafted in many ways, even if they’ve succumbed to streaming bloat, with them essentially functioning as half a season... But they never argue forcefully enough for their need to exist."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,positive,Dec 27,"The gigantic cash-filled pig looming over the players’ heads in SQUID GAME 2 is meant to entice & provoke. While the majority of players are lower-class citizens who had to take out loans to survive, some in season 2 have accumulated (and lost) a fortune."

RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,positive,Dec 27,"Granted, it’s slightly lacking in the emotional gut punches of season one, but it more than makes up for it with its boundless, sadistic imagination, relentless brutality, and a refreshing, deeply unserious kind of mischievousness."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,positive,Dec 27,"For all of its unevenness, particularly as it is warming up to the proper action, there is one big twist that really works, though whether it is distinct enough from what happens in the first series is unclear."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,positive,Dec 27,"Squid Game Season 2 may not be as innovative as Season 1, but it’s still fantastic TV. Hwang Dong-hyuk doubles down on his philosophy that humanity is sick, but worth saving."

RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,positive,Dec 27,"But while this season of Squid Game successfully stretches beyond the confines of the first, it excels for many of the same reasons as before, namely its ability to portray our worst qualities – and to really twist the knife when it counts."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,positive,Dec 27,"Season 2 doesn’t top the shocking novelty of the first season, made iconic by that giant mechanical girl in charge of a merciless game of red light, green light. Season 2 is a solid, logical, well-scripted bridge — possibly more, but not by much..."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,positive,Dec 27,What makes a second death game new and fresh is the unfortunate truth that it is impossible to get a group this big to agree on strategy. There are always enough greedy know-it-alls who think they can win.
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,positive,Dec 27,"Squid Game 2 gives us a satisfying roster of new games and twists, populated by a fresh cast of well-conceived contenders. However, the format loses some of its impact."

RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,positive,Dec 27,"...Season 2 survives by knowing there’s less to discover. It leans on our anticipation and occasionally plays off of it, deploying a twist here and a turn there, but more often capably caters to our expectations."

RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,positive,Dec 27,"The series displays a meaner, more critical streak toward the cash-poor participants... It emphasizes how, as much as the capitalistic system may push people to do rash things for money, the players themselves work to uphold such values."

RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,negative,Dec 27,"…As the long-awaited second of three planned seasons premieres, it’s clear that the Squid Game-industrial complex has undermined Squid Game the work of political art, in ways both tangential to Hwang’s storytelling and intrinsic to it."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,positive,Dec 27,Phenomenal - second seasons are difficult but this Squid Game is even better than the first. The show is now thinking globally with fantastic commentary that’s extremely relevant and insightful. The new games and characters are also excellent.
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,positive,Dec 27,"""Squid Game"" season two brings the cultural phenomenon back to Earth and executes the nigh-impossible, continuing what could have been a complete story in a way that's just as cutting as its predecessor."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,negative,Dec 27,"There are moments that shine through, but they stay at that: moments. Squid Game has finally returned and immediately earns itself a time-out."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,negative,Dec 27,"Season 2 doesn't serve Hwang's stated anticapitalist message, either; by the end it gets so wrapped up in details that it loses its political plot."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,negative,Dec 27,"The second season of Squid Game is a thorough letdown... It’s lacking in the fun and whimsy that kept the first season from wallowing in its backdrop of misery, and entirely lacking in new details or insights on the nature of the Game."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,negative,Dec 27,"But if the series is just a vehicle for more of the same high-design carnage, are we, collectively, just a bargain-basement version of the V.I.P.s?"
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,positive,Dec 27,"Season 2’s biggest flaw is ultimately that it’s an incomplete story, all set-up for the third and final season. And you’ll be craving that conclusion, while continuing to wonder at the forces which keep you watching."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,positive,Dec 27,"The second season doesn’t explore a lot of new territory thematically but, instead, cleverly expands the Squid Game universe while offering up a thriller that plays out like an even more brutal remix of the original."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,positive,Dec 27,"Grander and more audacious than its predecessor, Squid Game season 2 surpasses every hope and expectation viewers could have had for the series."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,positive,Dec 27,"As entertaining as this new group of players is, it’s disappointing that season 2 has them spending more time in the dorms arguing about whether to continue the games than playing the games themselves."

RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,negative,Dec 27,"Squid Game can't shake the desire to reiterate the same exhausting lessons about greed and human nature, and that does more to weigh down the narrative than lift it up."

RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,positive,Dec 26,"While this latest run of Squid Game would have been better served if it was cut down and combined with the upcoming third and final season, the series is still full of incisive commentary, well-founded rage, and fleeting moments of camaraderie."

RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,positive,Dec 26,"Season 2 goes all-in on its bet, taking a high-risk, high-reward strategy to map a return to the titular games. This is a deliberately disjointed tale, meant to ramp up an itch for the next season. The gamble is not yet over."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 2,Squid Game Season 2,2024,positive,Dec 26,"Good, but not great. Just when things get REALLY good, it ends on a cliffhanger. The 'real world' plotline sometimes felt forgotten, even though it's intriguing. Miles behind season 1, unfortunately. Still, can't wait for more."

RT,오징어 게임 시즌 3,Squid Game Season 3,2025,positive,Sep 11,"With season 3, Hwang probes his darkest depths yet. Souls are crushed as one despicable scenario after another unfolds, bleaker and meaner than the last, each trampling over the dying embers of morality and decency."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 3,Squid Game Season 3,2025,positive,Aug 30,"Squid Games Season 3 doesn’t aim to entertain — it dares to disturb. It asks uncomfortable questions about agency, complicity, and spectacle, even as it nudges you to press 'Next Episode.' What began as satire now ends as an..."

RT,오징어 게임 시즌 3,Squid Game Season 3,2025,positive,Jul 28,"As much as I personally love this show, the way we receive it as blind people is at a cost cutting measure, but is then supported by human audio description, which is a rarity for Netflix’s international content."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 3,Squid Game Season 3,2025,positive,Jul 22,"Call it season 2B, but Squid Game's wrap-up is mostly satisfying. Not everything works, specifically Myung-gi's uncertain motivations and conveniently impulsive actions. Still, The Starry Night is unquestionably the best episode the series has ever done."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 3,Squid Game Season 3,2025,positive,Jul 22,"A brief 6 episode watch that you'll be able to devour in a single evening. Like season 1, it is worthy of your attention despite its flaws, hopefully the world pays enough attention to learn something from it."

Park Sung-hoon and Im Si-wan stand out portraying the best and worst of us."
RT,오징어 게임 시즌 3,Squid Game Season 3,2025,negative,Jun 28,We have seen versions of this story before. And that familiarity robs the narrative of its impact -- particularly when the show so often telegraphs what is coming for viewers well before it finally happens.

RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,09/05/2021,"My respect for Bong Joon-Ho is up in the sky, because he and everyone else involved in this movie pretty much knocked it out of the park on multiple fronts."
RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,08/01/2021,"A bonkers, beautiful, radical, and drop-dead intelligent dark satirical tale of social inequality [and the] mock egalitarian weirdness of late capitalism."
RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,07/30/2021,"Like Ki-Jung, Park So-dam is the standout in a film filled with strong performances."
RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,06/27/2021,"Parasite finds a way to be visually stunning, thematically resonant, horrifyingly tragic and fantastically gripping while fooling the audience into thinking they are having the time of their life."
RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,06/25/2021,"It is such a clash of different genres and moods that it may as well be considered genreless, and yet it all somehow comes together in such a masterful way that you cannot help but leave the theater in a state of awe."
RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,02/18/2021,"Parasite is a master class in storytelling, providing one of the finest examples of how to entertain the masses while still telling a deep and meaningful story."

RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,negative,01/01/2021,The film feels too insincere and hypocritical to take genuinely seriously on its theme of social injustice.
RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,12/22/2020,"Boon Joon Ho keeps us thoroughly enthralled as the story unfolds, deftly calibrating shifts in tone between satire, screwball farce, black comedy and horror, and also nimbly balancing our sympathies between the two families."
RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,12/17/2020,"A splendid take on class inequalities that force the audience to question who is the parasite, the rich or the poor."
RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,12/07/2020,"Not content with a basic premise of crime and punishment, director Bong Joon Ho goes a step further, eventually corkscrewing off on a tangent that drags out the running time."
RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,11/03/2020,"Precisely controlled and drolly ironic in tone even as its events grow more and more berserk, Parasite is always entertaining, foremost."

RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,09/17/2020,Bong's work was leading to this galvanizing movie which has really shocked people into further questioning the wealth gap and understanding the precariousness of the urban underclass in an era of climate change...
RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,08/21/2020,"One of the best films of the decade and of Korean cinema (a nation that, by the way, has one of the most interesting filmographies of contemporary times). Its greatest strength is telling a story small but so powerful... [Full review in Spanish]"
RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,08/09/2020,"Bong's film is one which reveals itself in layers and it's almost impossible to categorise - it's at once a black comedy, thriller, horror, family drama and an allegory about class."

RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,07/30/2020,Parasite was the single best film I saw in 2019.
RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,07/29/2020,"The most impressive part? That even though this is a crowd-pleaser, it somehow manages to be marvelously depressing in ways that don't hit until after the credits roll."
RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,07/25/2020,Gripping.
RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,07/25/2020,"It's important to go in as fresh as possible to enjoy the film's juicy surprises, which are unraveled with the craft of a master, steadily building characters into the scheme, inviting our complicity, then yanking out the rug."
RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,07/24/2020,What starts off as a light-hearted comedy ends up becoming a bloody thriller as Bong intertwines slapstick comedy scenes and tense artful schemes.
RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,07/15/2020,The fallout of socio-economic disparities that pit one class of people against another has rarely been put on the big screen with the kind of savage candour and devastating intensity that Bong brings.
RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,07/09/2020,"Bong Joon-ho masterfully sets the table, and then delivers a raw, brutal critique to society. A masterpiece and one of 2019 best films. [Full review in Spanish]"

RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,06/23/2020,"In the movie's most vivid set piece, Bong demonstrates that water (to use a euphemism) rolls downhill: A downpour that is picturesque at the level of the mansion becomes a flood by the time it washes into the poor family's vulnerable neighborhood."
RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,05/20/2020,"Settling in for a narrative about a family trying to keep it together by overpowering the capitalistic battle, Bong Joon-ho has constructed a low-key tragic comedy that insists on being more than just that."
RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,05/11/2020,PARASITE is Bong Joon Ho's masterpiece.
RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,05/09/2020,"It's very rare a film makes a step-change in what is going on and the dynamics of the characters, and makes that work as well it does here."
RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,05/01/2020,"...director Bong is also working on other levels, not only making all of its characters relatable - the Parks are really quite sweet people, if a little lacking in self-awareness - but telling his story with a healthy dose of uproarious slapstick."
RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,04/24/2020,"A picture that audaciously devours the force of convention and transforms it into a feverish undercurrent, driving what can only be described as an engine through the odyssey of mayhem."
RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,04/14/2020,"Kudos go to Bong's sleight-of-hand narrative approach, as he seamlessly defying genres by alternating from drama to comedy to thriller and back again over the course of its 131-minute running time."
RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,negative,04/14/2020,Some satire but not at its best. And ugliness filled in the rest.

RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,04/04/2020,"With each passing day, Bong Joon-ho's class-conscious thriller about a family that lives in a sub-basement-and the blissfully naïve rich family they wind up working for-becomes even more prescient."
RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,03/09/2020,"Get ready for thrills and laughter. As the credits roll, all the layers of meaning in every shot, character and object become clear and you can't wait to spread the word. This is what cinema does best -- entertain, provoke, create discussion."

RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,02/21/2020,"From his opening shots, Bong Joon-Ho establishes the upstairs/downstairs dynamic of his razorsharp, bleakly funny, unmistakably furious skewering of capitalism and class divides."
RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,02/21/2020,"Bong hoped to give his film a classic sheen by creating a 'b&w' version. He needn't have done this: with or without color, Parasite will certainly be classic enough."
RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,02/20/2020,"It is bracing, audacious, jarring, challenging and exciting, a devastating social satire realized with precision and intelligence in every perfectly constructed frame."

RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,02/12/2020,"What makes Parasite such a good film is that it tells a story first and foremost, so the social commentary whilst ever present isn't so overpowering that you cannot just enjoy the story being told."

RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,02/11/2020,"Plugging into our universal disquiet about the inequality between the haves and have-nots, Bong has fashioned a darkly enjoyable class-war thriller in which the real monster is global capitalism itself, but there is nothing heady or didactic about it."
RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,02/10/2020,"One's left to wonder who's parasitically living off whom? The Kims off the Parks, or the Americans off their anti-communist allies?"

RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,02/08/2020,"Far from hiding, the film's beguiling charm stokes the deeply dystopian vision of its maker. In Bong's world, despite tokens like a cell phone or pizza dinners, social mobility doesn't quite exist."
RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,02/08/2020,"[I]ts delivery - mixing social satire, twisty plotting and Hitchcockian tension - a masterclass in serious-minded but accessible mainstream filmmaking."
RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,02/08/2020,[A]s a filmmaker [Bong's] less interested in finger-wagging admonishments than he is in taking us to uncomfortable places with outré plot twists that deepen and reframe what we think we know about the characters.
RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,02/08/2020,"Using industrial-strength social satire, [Bong Joon Ho] strips the veneer off the myth of classlessness, giving an outrageously entertaining instant classic."
RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,02/08/2020,"While Parasite has won critical acclaim worldwide, seeming to strike a chord with audiences for its raw class commentary, the movie's message is not clear cut. It's a dark comedy, but by the end you're not sure if the joke is on you after all."
RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,02/08/2020,"It works on every level which is, perhaps, fitting for a film about levels and whether you are at the top or bottom in life."
RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,02/06/2020,"Parasite is quite simply a supreme feat of film-making, a tense and hilarious jewel box of a film that draws you deeper and deeper into its wicked, absurdist satire."
RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,02/06/2020,"Parasite works as entertainment and analysis, treat and treatise."
RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,02/06/2020,An imaginative comedy-thriller with darkness at its core.
RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,02/06/2020,The word masterpiece is often too easily used... But you can easily understand why Parasite has been given that label by so many because finding a reason to disagree feels just as redundant.
RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,02/06/2020,"Though we largely root for the Kims, Bong doesn't allow anything as simple as rich versus poor, good versus bad. No wonder this movie speaks to global audiences - it's a parable about our capitalist world."
RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,02/06/2020,"A film that always has two thoughts in its head at once, a spectacular epic and tightly wound chamber piece, chicly sophisticated, brutal as a hammer."

RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,02/03/2020,A miracle of a film. It feels like Bong Joon-ho's already extraordinary career has been building to this: a riotous social satire that's as gloriously entertaining as it is deeply sardonic.

RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,01/31/2020,"We see what we want. We want what we see. Woe unto the collateral damage we leave. There may be no more original schemes, but the best movie of 2019 is more fascinated by original sins and the shapes they take in the here and now."

RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,01/29/2020,"In Parasite, Bong doesn't appear to be expressing empathy for the poor. Nor does he seem to be pointing fingers at the rich. He is, instead, questioning the very nature of mankind; its self-centred ingratitude and its propensity to create divisions."
RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,01/29/2020,It really is a must-see.
RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,01/28/2020,"Very few movies in recent years have left you unsure what's going to happen next, but even when you do, it's still a compelling watch. Quite simply, Parasite is a masterpiece."

RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,01/27/2020,"A deep and complex narrative, rich in social commentary, is intricately wrapped within layer upon layer of different complementary genres and tones."
RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,01/25/2020,"It plays like a brilliant con job comedy in the first half, before switching to total wacko mode at the end, with knives out and bloody. I liked the first half of this Jekyll and Hyde film a lot. The second half, not so much."
RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,01/24/2020,"Bong Joon-Ho here constructs a powerful and intense hybrid of genres, themes, and observations that grow and acquire sense as the story, which is full of rich details, unfolds. [Full Review in Spanish]"

RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,06/26/2019,"It's a weird but maybe era-appropriate coincidence that the two best films of the year so far-Us and now Parasite-are searing black comedies about class, featuring two rival families whose differences in wealth are largely the result of chance."
RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,06/24/2019,"Coming away from this film will leave you with empathy for those less privileged, and yet the film toys with the idea that even if you do fake your way to the top, you still may ultimately end up back in the basement."

RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,05/24/2019,"You'd be hard-put to find anything with the acerbic brilliance of Bong Joon-ho's Parasite, a masterful dissection of social inequality and the psychology of money."
RT,기생충,Parasite,2019,positive,05/23/2019,"To say much more would be to give away too many delicious surprises, but the film unfolds like a warped blend of Jordan's Peele's Us and Hirokazu Kore-eda's Shoplifters in its blazingly brutal, smart and heartfelt messaging."

RT,경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,positive,01/13/2024,"A lot to take in, and the human drama is much more compelling than the spookier stuff. Still, if entertainment is what you’re after, this show has it in spades. The sets, it’s worth mentioning, are jaw-dropping."
RT,경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,positive,01/11/2024,The few nagging loose ends can be forgiven in the face of a genuinely compelling watch.
RT,경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,positive,01/10/2024,"Gyeongseong Creature weaves elements of romance, horror, and political intrigue throughout its historical remix. And while all those themes aren’t perfectly balanced, it’s an addictive series all the same."
RT,경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,positive,01/06/2024,"The gore is intense and unrelenting — so much so that it ironically begins to lose impact. But amidst all the violence are well-developed stories of families, love and patriotism — and that’s what prevents this series from being just another horror show."
RT,경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,positive,12/24/2023,"The intensity is relentless, the sense of menace verges on operatic and I’m keen to unravel the layers of mystery."
RT,경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,positive,12/23/2023,"Despite our reservations, Gyeongseong Creature has a good story buried in all the murkiness. But we’re not sure if the show will actually be able to focus on that story as the first season goes along."
RT,경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,positive,12/23/2023,"Built around a desperate Japan’s tyranny in Korea near the end of World War II, it might not match Squid Game’s viewership, but for sheer entertainment value surpasses it in a way that deserves to be a monster hit."
RT,경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,positive,12/23/2023,"There’s nothing new here, but the combination of familiar elements in this specific composition is enough to provide plenty of consistent drama, especially given the sheer quality of the production."

The trouble is that the rest of the series just marches right past its most promising elements without stopping for more than a second."
RT,경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,positive,12/19/2023,This is a rare case where the genre ambitions of the streaming era have been successfully transplanted onto the traditional boy-girl K-drama.

RT,킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,negative,09/28/2023,"While the romance is quick to take off, there’s not enough time spent fleshing out the show’s many sub-plots."
RT,킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,positive,09/20/2023,You’ve seen the cold chaebol/hardworking female combo before in many popular K-dramas (including “Business Proposal”). But Im Yoon-ah and Lee Jun-ho are so charismatic and easy to watch in “King the Land” that they add a fresh touch to an old concept.
RT,킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,positive,08/09/2023,"Laced with prime-time comedic moments and gloriously schmoozy lovey moments, this latest Netflix Kdrama will warm the cockles of your heart."
RT,킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,positive,06/26/2023,"It won’t be for everyone, with its traditional rom-com formula potentially viewed as being from a bygone era by now, but there’s certainly enough about this drama to enjoy."
RT,킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,positive,06/22/2023,"King The Land is funny enough, despite some of the same issues we have with most Korean romcoms. But we just wonder if the show’s writers missed an opportunity, storywise."
RT,택배기사,Black Knight,2023,positive,01/23/2024,"While it remains wanting of a simpler but effective treatment of its plots and characters, Black Knight checks off all the boxes required to successfully transport us to a dusty, desolate South Korea."
RT,택배기사,Black Knight,2023,negative,09/09/2023,"There are so many disconnects between the subplots and the character journey’s that, ultimately, makes it difficult to binge-watch Black Knight."
RT,택배기사,Black Knight,2023,positive,07/27/2023,"""Black Knight"" takes place 40 years after a comet crashed into Earth, nearly destroying the entire population. The Korean series is clearly a parable for what could happen to our world if we don't take better care of the most vulnerable among us."

RT,택배기사,Black Knight,2023,positive,05/14/2023,The essential kineticism of Black Knight is the primary reason to watch it. It takes all the hallmarks of good Korean drama but presents them in an unusually digestible package.
RT,택배기사,Black Knight,2023,positive,05/13/2023,"It’s far too cartoonish to become another phenomenon... Still, as dystopian escapism goes, the series delivers thrill, spills and chills with dead-eyed efficiency."
RT,택배기사,Black Knight,2023,positive,05/13/2023,"Black Knight may take a couple of episodes to fully build out its world, but it’s not a slow-paced introduction to this post-apocalyptic version of Seoul, with stunning visuals and well-done fight sequences."
RT,택배기사,Black Knight,2023,positive,05/13/2023,Black Knight still manages to rise above being yet another story about the postapocalypse and become something that feels surprisingly fresh...
RT,택배기사,Black Knight,2023,positive,05/13/2023,"It’s all endearingly silly – imagine that your Ocado driver is Tom Hardy in Mad Max: Fury Road, and you won’t be far off."
RT,택배기사,Black Knight,2023,positive,05/12/2023,"When Black Knight manages to speed ahead from its occasionally belabored setups and gives its best elements room to breathe, it works as a more propulsive action thriller."
RT,택배기사,Black Knight,2023,positive,05/12/2023,"Black Knight is a fine science fiction offering. Its big concept and the landscape ends up being more unwieldy than not, but if you’re a fan of Kim Woo-bin, his moments really make tuning in worth it."
RT,택배기사,Black Knight,2023,negative,05/12/2023,"We quickly understand where the story needs to go, but there is very little forward momentum, no excitement to leave us begging for more as one episode ends."
RT,택배기사,Black Knight,2023,positive,05/12/2023,"When one-shots and skillful drone work are employed, the show can be immersive and exciting. The story suffers from not fully examining the themes it establishes, making what could be an excellent series into something that’s just OK but fun."
RT,야차,Yaksha: Ruthless Operations,2022,negative,08/19/2024,"It’s a bit sluggish during the last leg and devoid of the action we desperately crave, kind of making watching this a mixed bag."

RT,카터,Carter,2022,negative,07/20/2023,"The film-making on display is so egregiously bad that it’s not even funny. It genuinely feels like a rough edit of the film, masquerading as the final product, has been uploaded to the streaming platform."
RT,카터,Carter,2022,positive,01/03/2023,"As mentioned before, “Carter” is one of those films that one could easily fast forward to the action scenes, while its duration is extravagant. At the same time though, the former are so impressive and so many, that it ends up being highly entertaining"

RT,카터,Carter,2022,negative,08/11/2022,"More style than substance, and more like a video game than a coherent story, Carter is basically a long frenzy of fighting with all kinds of weapons and extended vehicle chase."
RT,카터,Carter,2022,positive,08/08/2022,"Jung’s primary task isn’t to make a Russian Ark of action but instead a reason for Hardcore Henry to jolt. [Carter does] not reach the dizzying heights of Jung’s prior feature The Villainess, but that film doesn’t have a helicopter doing a butterfly kick."
RT,카터,Carter,2022,negative,08/08/2022,"By the end, Carter remains easy to appreciate in terms of its sheer ambition - but with the exception of its opening stretch, the execution doesn’t match director Jung’s lofty aims."

The trouble is that the rest of the series just marches right past its most promising elements without stopping for more than a second."
RT,경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,positive,12/19/2023,This is a rare case where the genre ambitions of the streaming era have been successfully transplanted onto the traditional boy-girl K-drama. The high concept and lavish spectacle embellish and enrich the central relationship between our attractive stars.
RT,킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,positive,Aug 15,"The show has no interest in reinventing the wheel. Instead, it not only sticks to, but also fully embraces the humour in the well-trodden path as the main love story unfolds."
RT,킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,negative,05/14/2024,"Although anything could happen with the next 14 episodes, it is hard to imagine this flaccid and shallow fantasy improving as it goes forward."
RT,킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,positive,01/13/2024,"This drama created so much buzz for all the wrong reasons when it first started airing, yet it ended up one of my favourite romances of the year."
RT,킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,negative,09/28/2023,"While the romance is quick to take off, there’s not enough time spent fleshing out the show’s many sub-plots."
RT,킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,positive,09/20/2023,You’ve seen the cold chaebol/hardworking female combo before in many popular K-dramas (including “Business Proposal”). But Im Yoon-ah and Lee Jun-ho are so charismatic and easy to watch in “King the Land” that they add a fresh touch to an old concept.
RT,킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,positive,08/09/2023,"Laced with prime-time comedic moments and gloriously schmoozy lovey moments, this latest Netflix Kdrama will warm the cockles of your heart."
RT,킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,positive,06/26/2023,"It won’t be for everyone, with its traditional rom-com formula potentially viewed as being from a bygone era by now, but there’s certainly enough about this drama to enjoy."
RT,킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,positive,06/22/2023,"King The Land is funny enough, despite some of the same issues we have with most Korean romcoms. But we just wonder if the show’s writers missed an opportunity, storywise."

RT,지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,positive,07/26/2023,“All of Us Are Dead” uses a zombie attack to examine Korean & global Issues. There’s a lot to unpack underneath the surface of Netflix’s hit zombie thriller. The teens aren't alright and are continually failed by adults who view them as collateral damage.
RT,지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,positive,07/21/2023,"What is admirable about All of Us Are Dead is how it humanises the students, major and minor characters, and portrays how much they worry about their parents and grades."

RT,지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,negative,02/15/2022,"While the diminishing returns of the shows narrative are a disappointment, the moral implications of its wide-ranging smorgasbord of social commentary are bewildering, if not outright alarming."
RT,지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,positive,02/12/2022,"This stunning Korean series shows that it’s still possible to make compelling, imaginative, thought-provoking and hugely entertaining zombie splatter more than a decade after The Walking Dead spawned an unending genre glut."
RT,지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,positive,02/12/2022,"All Of Us Are Dead takes this formula and executes it flawlessly, in a slow-burn 12-episode odyssey about survival instinct and survivor’s guilt, the hope that pushes us forward and the grief that holds us back."
RT,지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,positive,02/11/2022,"Any new zombie-themed show must work hard to step out of The Walking Dead’s long shadow. Fortunately, All of Us Are Dead... pulls it off with a simple trick: It’s not so damn mean."
RT,지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,positive,02/05/2022,"This 12-part South Korean Netflix series about zombies invading a high school is gruesome, thrilling, and highly addictive."

RT,지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,positive,02/04/2022,All of Us Are Dead does a fantastic job of introducing a large core cast and establishing a lot of characters as distinct personalities.
RT,지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,positive,02/04/2022,"The series is not really elevated and, at 12 hours, is way too long. If you’re addicted to variations on the zombie apocalypse, you will enjoy the South Korean riff on a familiar format. It isn’t Squid Game, though. Far from it."
RT,지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,positive,02/02/2022,"We are here for the zombie-filled madness and relentless violence, and this series delivers. It could easily be trimmed down, but it is so entertaining."
RT,지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,negative,02/01/2022,It's delivered in an oddly-paced season that fights against an intuitive structure as much as these students try to beat back chomps from throngs of kids in uniforms.

RT,지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,positive,01/29/2022,"Like Squid Game before it, All of Us Are Dead makes the most out of its nightmarish central location to otherworldly, dizzying effect."

RT,지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,positive,01/28/2022,"The implication is clear - that even as the virus spreads beyond the boundaries of the school and into the wider world, it's the result of festering ills and systemic injustices that have seeped from the top down. The rot is everywhere."
RT,지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,positive,01/28/2022,"Paced like a bullet and emotionally resonant when it needs to be, Netflix's new Korean zombie show makes for an immensely bingeable 12 hours of TV."
RT,지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,positive,01/28/2022,"All of Us Are Dead distinguishes its focus. This, combined with the drama-filled high school setting, helps the show carve out its own space in the crowded zombie pantheon."
RT,지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,positive,01/27/2022,"""All of Us Are Dead"" is nothing if not self-aware. It's also quite well executed, even when it feels more like an exercise than an organic creation."
RT,택배기사,Black Knight,2023,positive,01/23/2024,"While it remains wanting of a simpler but effective treatment of its plots and characters, Black Knight checks off all the boxes required to successfully transport us to a dusty, desolate South Korea."
RT,택배기사,Black Knight,2023,negative,09/09/2023,"There are so many disconnects between the subplots and the character journey’s that, ultimately, makes it difficult to binge-watch Black Knight."
RT,택배기사,Black Knight,2023,positive,07/27/2023,"""Black Knight"" takes place 40 years after a comet crashed into Earth, nearly destroying the entire population. The Korean series is clearly a parable for what could happen to our world if we don't take better care of the most vulnerable among us."
RT,택배기사,Black Knight,2023,positive,07/19/2023,The South Korean industry once again demonstrates its strength by shaping an entertaining film full of action and intrigue that skillfully balances its cliches with a good dose of intensity and an admirable ability to captivate.
RT,택배기사,Black Knight,2023,negative,06/11/2023,"When the show's own characters don't seem to care that the world has basically ended, I'm not really sure why I'm supposed to either."
RT,택배기사,Black Knight,2023,negative,05/24/2023,An otherwise compelling show buckles under the weight of mind-numbing violence.
RT,택배기사,Black Knight,2023,negative,05/23/2023,"The world could be brutal and aimless... But, boredom is unforgivable. And the messenger, except for some entertaining sequences and appealing images, is a flat character who wanders in a monotonous series. [Full review in Spanish]"
RT,택배기사,Black Knight,2023,positive,05/14/2023,The essential kineticism of Black Knight is the primary reason to watch it. It takes all the hallmarks of good Korean drama but presents them in an unusually digestible package.
RT,택배기사,Black Knight,2023,positive,05/13/2023,"It’s far too cartoonish to become another phenomenon... Still, as dystopian escapism goes, the series delivers thrill, spills and chills with dead-eyed efficiency."
RT,택배기사,Black Knight,2023,positive,05/13/2023,"Black Knight may take a couple of episodes to fully build out its world, but it’s not a slow-paced introduction to this post-apocalyptic version of Seoul, with stunning visuals and well-done fight sequences."
RT,택배기사,Black Knight,2023,positive,05/13/2023,Black Knight still manages to rise above being yet another story about the postapocalypse and become something that feels surprisingly fresh...
RT,택배기사,Black Knight,2023,positive,05/13/2023,"It’s all endearingly silly – imagine that your Ocado driver is Tom Hardy in Mad Max: Fury Road, and you won’t be far off."
RT,택배기사,Black Knight,2023,positive,05/12/2023,"When Black Knight manages to speed ahead from its occasionally belabored setups and gives its best elements room to breathe, it works as a more propulsive action thriller."
RT,택배기사,Black Knight,2023,positive,05/12/2023,"Black Knight is a fine science fiction offering. Its big concept and the landscape ends up being more unwieldy than not, but if you’re a fan of Kim Woo-bin, his moments really make tuning in worth it."
RT,택배기사,Black Knight,2023,negative,05/12/2023,"We quickly understand where the story needs to go, but there is very little forward momentum, no excitement to leave us begging for more as one episode ends."
RT,택배기사,Black Knight,2023,positive,05/12/2023,"When one-shots and skillful drone work are employed, the show can be immersive and exciting. The story suffers from not fully examining the themes it establishes, making what could be an excellent series into something that’s just OK but fun."
RT,야차,Yaksha: Ruthless Operations,2022,negative,08/19/2024,"It’s a bit sluggish during the last leg and devoid of the action we desperately crave, kind of making watching this a mixed bag."
RT,야차,Yaksha: Ruthless Operations,2022,negative,07/16/2024,"By sidestepping [the] basic moral conflict, Yaksha is artistically hollow."
RT,야차,Yaksha: Ruthless Operations,2022,positive,07/27/2023,"A fast-moving action film full of special ops, backstabbing and political intrigue, ""Yaksha: Ruthless Operations"" doesn't pretend to be a prestige film. But it's a fun ride with a (straight-laced) fish-out-of-water concept."
RT,야차,Yaksha: Ruthless Operations,2022,negative,07/22/2022,"The plot in Yaksha: Ruthless Operations is quite weak, and the characters rather boring."
RT,야차,Yaksha: Ruthless Operations,2022,negative,06/14/2022,"For a film that follows several characters who bend the law if it means achieving their goals, it's a little dissatisfying the extent to which the film plays things by the book."

RT,야차,Yaksha: Ruthless Operations,2022,negative,04/17/2022,"Sluggish, predictable and almost wilfully devoid of thrills, South Korean action drama Yaksha: Ruthless Operations offers none of the unpredictable or mischievous antics teased by its curious title."
RT,야차,Yaksha: Ruthless Operations,2022,positive,04/13/2022,Yaksha: Ruthless Operations brings a heap of trigger-happy spycraft to its tale of secrets and lies and two-faced promises on the way to sorting out some hard-earned justice.
RT,야차,Yaksha: Ruthless Operations,2022,positive,04/11/2022,A briskly paced spy thriller with some quality action sequences and engaging characters.
RT,야차,Yaksha: Ruthless Operations,2022,positive,04/11/2022,"Yaksha: Ruthless Operations doesn't reinvent the wheel but it does embrace the spy subgenre with open arms, allowing the tropes to do the work without getting bogged down by them, and always keeping its characters primary to the story."
RT,야차,Yaksha: Ruthless Operations,2022,negative,04/09/2022,"Definitely, it gives you moments of entertainment, but the bumpy roads give you the jerk, which is neither comfortable nor satisfying."
RT,카터,Carter,2022,negative,07/16/2024,There are some regretfully great action pieces here—the spinning helicopter fight being the best among them—but the spectacle is calculatedly capricious beyond redemption.
RT,카터,Carter,2022,negative,09/09/2023,Carter is a dizzying movie that shows violence with well-choreographed action sequences.
RT,카터,Carter,2022,negative,07/20/2023,"The film-making on display is so egregiously bad that it’s not even funny. It genuinely feels like a rough edit of the film, masquerading as the final product, has been uploaded to the streaming platform."
RT,카터,Carter,2022,positive,01/03/2023,"As mentioned before, “Carter” is one of those films that one could easily fast forward to the action scenes, while its duration is extravagant. At the same time though, the former are so impressive and so many, that it ends up being highly entertaining"
RT,카터,Carter,2022,negative,12/27/2022,"This has a very interesting first person action flare, that swings & takes some very daring chances. But the transitions, editing, & heavy CG don't lend the film any chances of re-watchability because you fail to appreciate the general action and story"
RT,카터,Carter,2022,positive,09/01/2022,I was let down by the storytelling and tired by the end. But I can’t deny the kinetic sensation brought on by action sequences and the sheer craftsmanship behind them.
RT,카터,Carter,2022,negative,08/29/2022,"When a oner has been stitched together with digital trickery, it is easy to get caught playing ""Spot the cut."" But in the case of Carter, the trickery is so blatantly obvious we are deprived of even that pleasure."
RT,카터,Carter,2022,negative,08/20/2022,Carter looks like a two-hour long trailer – but not really a movie. Others may disagree.
RT,카터,Carter,2022,negative,08/18/2022,"Jung’s latest film delivers some dizzying action amidst an undercooked, familiar story of espionage and backdoor politics mired in risky decisions that rarely work."
RT,카터,Carter,2022,positive,08/13/2022,"A deliriously relentless action onslaught that should place Byung-gil Jung alongside the likes of Bay, Neveldine and Taylor et al as a director to watch for unbounded cinematic spectacle."
RT,카터,Carter,2022,positive,08/13/2022,"A caterwaul of action on top of, inside of, and to the side of other action, Carter is often as bewildering and exhausting as it is riotously entertaining."
RT,카터,Carter,2022,negative,08/12/2022,"This is a movie packed with ideas, many very dumb, but not without a vision to deliver a lot of ridiculous bloody fun. It’s not quite good, but it’s very much Carter…whatever that means."

RT,카터,Carter,2022,negative,08/11/2022,What’s most frustrating with Carter is that the bones of legitimately cool set-pieces and skilled action performers/stunts are clearly visible beneath the noise.
RT,카터,Carter,2022,negative,08/11/2022,"More style than substance, and more like a video game than a coherent story, Carter is basically a long frenzy of fighting with all kinds of weapons and extended vehicle chase."
RT,카터,Carter,2022,positive,08/08/2022,"Jung’s primary task isn’t to make a Russian Ark of action but instead a reason for Hardcore Henry to jolt. [Carter does] not reach the dizzying heights of Jung’s prior feature The Villainess, but that film doesn’t have a helicopter doing a butterfly kick."
RT,카터,Carter,2022,negative,08/08/2022,"By the end, Carter remains easy to appreciate in terms of its sheer ambition - but with the exception of its opening stretch, the execution doesn’t match director Jung’s lofty aims."
RT,카터,Carter,2022,negative,08/07/2022,"Carter is an adrenaline rush from start to finish, and the idea of commiting to this type of film takes guts. That being said, the experience is exhausting, and the story has its fair share of issues. Fans of the genre may have fun with it."
RT,카터,Carter,2022,negative,08/06/2022,"Like the main character, we're barely given time to draw breathe — and the film suffers for it."
RT,카터,Carter,2022,positive,08/06/2022,Carter is the proverbial nonstop action thrill ride that every blockbuster claims to be.
RT,카터,Carter,2022,negative,08/06/2022,"Shattering both your low expectations and will to live, Netflix’s Carter is an action film so ridiculous that you’ll often wish that you were among the scores of faceless villains whose heads are smashed to a pulp by the film’s protagonist."
RT,카터,Carter,2022,negative,08/06/2022,"Its awful stylistic decisions make it a real drag to get through, and really squander its stronger aspects."
RT,카터,Carter,2022,positive,08/05/2022,"What Carter sets out to accomplish in action, choreography, and set design, it pulls off with great aplomb. However, those looking for a more character-driven story... might find Carter’s 132-minute runtime a bit too overwhelming."
RT,카터,Carter,2022,negative,08/05/2022,Never has a film tried so hard to emulate the look and feel of a video game than Jung Byung-gil’s dizzyingly ridiculous Carter.
RT,카터,Carter,2022,positive,08/05/2022,"... seems to be inspired by several films all at once, providing a narrative we’re familiar with told through a myriad of references that engage the audience in one moment and totality destroy immersion in another."
