오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"I found the show to be fantastic, only ruined by the horrible VIP acting."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"My God the actors who potrayed the VIP people cannot act. I cringed everytime they said a line. It felt like they were just reading them. Even the intonation was off. It was like when we were kids and had to read a play in class and we exagerated the intonation. Terrible, just awful."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"Seriously. All things considered, they're a pretty small and self-contained part. The main characters were brilliant in their roles. I guess good actors figured that having parts where they're wearing masks the whole time wouldn't get them much exposure. The pacing and character development were superb."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"The VIPs once again are execreble actors. The gravitas and emotion of the show are turned farcical as soon as these rejects from every grade 7 play start talking. Even their gestures are cringe worthy. Non English speaking directors can not distinguish bad acting from good in foreign actors. Test this theory on any film made anywhere at any time in a non English speaking country, which contains an ""American"" in it. Japanese flicks are notorious for this, even Kurosawa. Break out the ham. I can imagine the ads run in Seoul papers: ""Foreign English speaking actors needed."" And since last time I checked Seoul isn't L. A., the pool of trained, good, professional actors must run at about ZERO candidates. Show is great otherwise: The contrast between the quality of acting in these cheesy foreigners and the Korean cast couldn't be more obvious. LA London Toronto and Vancouver have loads of actors serving table who would be great. Think about it guys."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"Just watched whole 9 episodes and my favorite was the 6th, Gganbu. Not perfect nor a masterpiece, but this is very well made and provides a certain level of emotional experience. The overall show was far beyond things that were shown in trailer. Very well directed, performed, and finding its own unique points from the genre mixture of various references such as Gambling Apocalypse : Kaiji, Battle Royale, and so on. Just hope all others enjoy this show not only in Korea but also everywhere!  Ps. Even to Korean ears, VIPs' English conversations were not well written nor performed. I think the drama could stand well enough without their presence and save the budget."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"After hearing about all the hype and seeing it was one of the most watched series in the entire world I finally found time to watch Squid Game. I have to admit that I had fun watching it and was very entertained throughout the entire season. It's about hundreds of contestants (who are all down on their luck and need money) that are asked to play children's games for an shot at winning a lot of money, 45.6 billion won (about 33 million dollars). The only thing is these children games are now all deadly and the last contestant standing wins all the money. It will pull you into its world and before you know it you'll be hooked. It's a thriller with lots of twists and lots of violence. This is a show that will stay in your mind long after you watched it. I know it's already been renewed for another seasons so I hope they can keep the same magic they had for season one."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,,,"Comparisons to Season 1 are nonsensical. Season 1 was an original concept that stood and succeeded on its own, which cannot be the case for subsequent seasons.  The best thing about Season 2 is the acting. The cast is absolutely great! Where Squid Game 2 feels lacking, is in its refusal to resolve ANY of the multiple threads in this season. There are many ways to build suspense, but the laziest one is where you just refuse to answer any questions you raised for an entire seasons, leaving it to be addressed in Season 3. It is quite evident that the show is now a lot less interested in telling a satisfying story and more invested in stretching the franchise into a multi-season subscription-retention machine."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"For someone who has seen Alice in Borderland and loved it, I see this series as a more mature and rawer version, without fantasies. Criticism of the capitalism of today's society, ironic how it turned out, becoming everything it criticized.  Decent 8/10."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,,,"I think it's really good show but the VIP acting is horrible. Seems rushed and no quality.  Slowness to find Truth on the boat team.  Very rushed acting and quality. Looks like Ai is playing big part of it.  When Squid Game premiered on Netflix in 2021, it quickly became a global phenomenon-and for good reason. The South Korean series, created by Hwang Dong-hyuk, is more than just a dystopian survival drama. It's a razor-sharp commentary on capitalism, human behavior, and the moral cost of desperation. While many have already praised its thrilling plot and visual style, Squid Game stands out for its meticulous attention to quality-both in storytelling and production."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"Squid Game. Wow.  Korean.  Best description? Uncomfortably genius!  (Kind of disturbing - small warning but still)  I mean there are some elements of The Game and Hunger Games, but this is bigger, more catastrophic in a different way, more clever, plays on psychological aspects, with a touch of closeness between some participants. Its intensely catchy and totally insane.  Its set in a today's society with participants being people in economic trouble who owes a lot of money, mostly from gambling, and about their desperation. Great actors too!!  They even include a very dark business of todays world - but I wont reveal anything here.  Although its brutal - its more brutal in what's actually going on, and what's happening - than being graphically brutal.  And you will sit there and feel lots of things - scared and somewhat freaked out as well, and as I said: its Uncomfortably geniusly made in my opinion.  If you're looking for something different that will get your HR rising, try this one! *Handclaps*"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"There will be great division on the success of the latest seasons. The writer himself confessed he intended Squid Games to be a 1 season work (One of the greatest seasons in modern television history).  Netflix capitalised on the global success of season 1 and understandably the writer wanted his pay day. And so, Season 2 and 3 was born.  These are at best, filler seasons. They give you very little new revelation, and story loses its focus and there are many wasted character arcs.  I liked moments in Season 2 (for example the round and round we go episode was EPIC). But most of the shock is lost as Season 1 was both the origin and peak of the entire franchise.  I'm grateful that Season 1 can be watched in its entirety as a standalone season. And you can just leave S2 and 3 at the door if you choose. I'm grateful this show was created, despite it now turning into a never ending cash cow for Netflix."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Just binged the whole 9 episodes, best thing I've seen on Netflix since I opened my account. Even though it's dubbed, you hardly notice! Watch it, you won't be disappointed! 👍👍👍"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"One of the best K Netflix series I've seen in recent years. The plot, cinematography, and acting (with the exception of some masked caucasians in the end) was superb. Several A-list actors were in this show and the cameos by them were very well woven into the story. Looking forward to a season 2."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"Season 1 was truly a groundbreaking experience. There is definitely the masterpiece in the Korean cinematography and if you are after Korean style of cinema, S1 is definitely for you.  If you prefer to have everything as a ""happy end"" and closed story which appears more in American movies, S2 and S3 are for you.  All seasons can be described as 9 to 5. The first season is something that you thrive to watch and know how the final episode will look like. Season 2 is a replica of S1, good enough to watch but once you experienced the original, you are not satisfied with the continuation. S3 is the last hope that producers may bounce back and create something unique and unusual, which is the signature of the series. However, last 2 episodes have been watched with a face-palm face as you can see that producers wanna end the show in a Hollywood fashion.  In short, S1 is the only part you should watch."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,I loved it but three last episodes killed the vibe.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,2,,"We waited 3 or something years for season two to be released (I don't even remember how long, too long) and we get only seven, yes SEVEN episodes, it's ridiculous. Story is so boring and drags at the beginning too much and too many episodes before something will happen. Only thing I like is the characters they are likeable, you really care who survives and who not, but that's all. They talk too much during the games, stop cheering and so on and there is no way they would finish the games in real time, it's like time stops all the time to wait the conversations to end in the games. You can even see in the second game when there is time left 6 seconds(clock on the wall) and they stop moving, starts talking and when they are finished talking they keep moving and pass the finish line  It's just ridiculous that they cut season 2 and 3 in half and we have to wait maybe whole year for the next season, AGAIN!? Yes it's about to get more money but it's just ridiculous.  Maybe squid game lost its hype because of this ridiculously long waiting for the next season, but I'm not impressed at the moment after these SEVEN episodes.  Streaming era is just stupid, you age 10 years if you want to watch one show from the beginning to the end and that's maybe 2-4 seasons(7-10 episodes/season). Bring back tv era and 20 episode seasons, thanks.  How many time I said ridiculous? Yes but it's ridiculous."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"Would rate first season as 9/10, second and third - 5 or 6 max. Doesn't worth watching after first, it's nothing like first season, completely pointless things and undeveloped plot and characters, supposedly just to earn more money from a famous tv show.  Flat characters and not logical character decisions, even games from squid games slowly disappeared to be pure killing and betrayal.  With all that depth and idea that first season had, was touching, interesting, when you deeply cared about characters, somehow they did typical low budget show when you are tired already being disappointed of obvious bad, stupid character decisions that couldn't take place. Flat characters was biggest disappointment and made feeling of wasted time."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"This is another perfect example of why some great TV series should not keep running just to try and make more money. The first series is simply amazing, the second series is meh and the third series is poor.  I am also not sure why the actors that play the VIPS are such terrible actors, its really odd & thier acting seems to get worse as the series progresses.  Over all its a good phsycological drama, yes its over the top violent and a lot of exageration and although I would say it tends to side with the bad in humans much more than the good people that are out there. Its still a decent series to watch just maybe just watch series one and end it there."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"I could've given this 10 but the VIPs ruined this for me. Why the need to add non Korean actors who are so bad at acting? Their sudden appearance in the show threw me off. I didn't know English speaking can be so cringy at such a masterpiece. There was no need to add foreigners, especially ones who are really bad actors. No offense, I'm not one to discrimate any color, but I swear those VIPs don't blend in. I normally like diversity in shows and like seeing a mix of differemt cultures but come on! Totally unecessary on squid game! It ruined this masterpiece! Also, the AI baby is too obvious though I understand it's best to use AI baby than a real one."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"The first season of Squid Game was nothing short of groundbreaking, earning a well-deserved 9/10. It introduced a rich tapestry of characters, with Kang Sae-byeok and Song Gi-hun standing out as particularly memorable. The script masterfully balanced suspense and emotional storytelling, making viewers deeply invested in the characters' fates. The ""games"" were not only creative and thrilling but also served as a sharp critique of societal structures, keeping audiences hooked from start to finish.  Unfortunately, the second season was a significant letdown, feeling like a pseudo-disaster in comparison. The script was riddled with illogical moments, and the plot lacked depth, becoming one of the most boring narratives I've ever watched. Character development was virtually nonexistent, with the main character devolving into a dull, idiotic, and delusional shadow of their former self. The acting ranged from mediocre to outright poor, further diminishing the season's impact.  The games, once the heart-pounding highlight of the series, were uninspired and poorly executed, lacking the cinematic flair that made the first season unforgettable. It felt as though the creators had run out of ideas, delivering a predictable and frustratingly shallow storyline.  While the first season showcased the best of Squid Game's potential, the second tarnished its legacy. I've tried to overlook the second season's flaws, but its glaring issues make it hard to hold onto my initial admiration. What once felt like a solid 9/10 show now struggles to even reach a 7/10. The magic of Squid Game was in its originality and emotional resonance, and the second season failed to capture either."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"Season 1 was amazing. It had intense games, emotional stories, and powerful messages about society. Naturally, I was really excited for Season 2, but it didn't live up to my expectations.  The story in Season 2 feels weaker. It tries to expand the world, but it doesn't have the same emotional impact or smart storytelling as the first season. The new characters aren't as memorable, and even the returning ones don't have the same depth or connection to the audience.  The pacing is also a problem. Some parts drag on too long, while others feel rushed. The games are still creative and the visuals are stunning, but it's not enough to make up for the messy story.  Season 2 feels like it's trying too hard to be bigger and more exciting, but it loses the heart and tension that made the first season so special. While there are a few good moments, overall, it's a letdown compared to Season 1."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Honestly wow - from the first episode I sat wide mouthed, what am I watching and why - I didn't care.  This series is amazing, it's brutal, it made me cry - what a watch.  Suddenly you don't care about the subtitles, they pale into nothing, they don't matter - you find yourself watching this, reading effortlessly.  An amazing series, thank you!"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,Please remove all traces of the VIPs and you can get the 2 stars back.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Was released today and I was hooked by the first 20 minutes. I finished it all the same day , if there was more seasons I would've been watching the next episodes as I'm typing this up right now. Very good series that will have you at the edge of your seat with many twists and turns. Once you think you know what's coming next , it hits you with a curveball. Highly recommended .  You can watch this in one day easily as I did & it was just released a couple hours ago haha ."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"This show is the best versions of a genre which has been done before. It's just unbelievably aesthetic, gripping and full of suspense. Some episodes are funny and some are very heavy. The season ending is perfect and fulfilling."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"When I first saw the trailer, I knew I would watch this show in one day. It is a nice thriller drama that kept me hook throughout. The games that were played and the relationships between the characters is what got me into this show even more. Ending was somewhat predictable, but it was still a good show to watch. I do recommend for you to watch it."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"Season 1 of Squid Game was lightning in a bottle. The acting? Phenomenal. Every character-from Gi-hun's desperate charm to Sang-woo's moral decay-was beautifully written and emotionally gripping. You felt their pain, their dilemmas, their slow unraveling. The pacing hit just right, giving room to breathe in emotional moments and ratcheting tension during the games. It didn't treat the audience like toddlers-it trusted us to pick up on themes without spoon-feeding them. The story was unique, bold, and devastatingly human.  Then came Season 2.  Where do I even begin?  The writing nosedived into the realm of forced exposition. Characters didn't speak-they explained. Every philosophical idea was shoved in our faces through clunky, unnatural dialogue, often delivered by minor characters who felt like they were auditioning for a late-night sitcom. The emotional weight that grounded Season 1? Gone. The new characters are flat, unearned, and awkwardly placed into scenes that serve the plot, not the story. The acting-surprisingly-was a shadow of its former self, even from actors who shined in S1.  The pacing was chaos. Important events were either dragged out or dropped in randomly without balance or emotional setup. It felt like the writers had a checklist of plot points and just shoved the characters through them, regardless of logic or consistency. And the philosophical themes? Instead of emerging from the story, they were thrown in as surface-level, pseudo-intellectual lines you forget five minutes later.  Season 2 didn't just stumble-it betrayed what made Season 1 a masterpiece.  Here's hoping Squid Game: America with David Fincher brings back the nuance, tension, and respect for its audience that the original once mastered."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"Squid Game is a brilliant metaphor for several things, but especially capitalism. 456 broken and bankrupt rats are set on a deadly race for a vast prize in an absurd and cartoonish version of hell. And who would willingly leave hell if there was even a chance, however outlandish, that staying might suddenly make them a billionaire? Very little of this series otherwise makes sense, and it makes an absolute meal of it.  There are similarities to shows like Battle Royale or Alice in Borderland, but Squid Game does a much better job of making characters believable and likeable. Even passing characters feel like actual people, so you care for the thirty seconds or so that you get to know them before they pass.  The design of the show is brilliant, the performances are all excellent. The danger feels real and the jokes are genuinely funny. I'm only on episode 2, but I love this show already. Personally, I like it better than Alice in Borderland.  EDIT: Just very quickly, a lot of reviews on here are mentioning the cringeworthy acting and dialogue of the VIPs. I agree, but I think there must be a reason for this. It seems unlikely that the same people who cast, wrote and directed all the other terrific performances suddenly lost the ability to cast, write for and direct non-Koreans. It seems more likely their relative cartoonishness had a specific meaning and purpose... even if we haven't figured out what it is, yet."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"I started it in 2021 the year it came out and it was a big hit and it got popular around the world, so I was surprised of the success and when I watched it i was very interested to see how it went, i love the drama and the story of the game and the characters in the series and the last three episodes of season one really made me feel emotional, so i was so excited to see the second season but they took a lot of time to make it and now in the last December they just released it and I watched it, it was perfect and I loved it so much and I just released that the show got even bigger than the first season, i am happy to live with this franchise and i am so excited for season three and sadly it will be the last season hope they do well in the next chapter, see you in june 26.( also i will graduate yaaay🔥✨)"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"""Very Disheartening to See How They Spoiled the Show in the End"" - A Reflection on Squid Game Season 3  There are few shows in recent memory that managed to grip the global audience with such ferocity as Squid Game. When Season 1 premiered, it was revolutionary-a bold, brutal, and heart-wrenching social commentary that took us deep into the darkest corners of human nature. It wasn't just a Korean drama; it was a mirror to society's obsession with wealth, power, and survival. Naturally, expectations were sky-high for its future seasons. Unfortunately, after watching Season 3, I can't help but feel deeply disappointed.  To say the show was spoiled in the end feels like an understatement. It's disheartening to see how something so powerful, raw, and emotionally intelligent was reduced to a shell of its former self. The final episodes of Season 3 felt rushed, forced, and frankly, unnecessary. Where there was once soul, now remains only spectacle. It seems the creators were more focused on topping the shock value of previous seasons rather than staying true to the show's original essence.  What made Squid Game iconic wasn't just its gruesome games or the cliffhangers. It was the storytelling-the human moments, the characters you couldn't help but root for, and the gut-wrenching moral dilemmas that left you questioning what you would do in their shoes. In Season 3, much of that depth was lost. Characters were introduced with potential, only to be killed off meaninglessly. Plot twists felt unearned. And the ending... it lacked both closure and clarity, leaving more frustration than intrigue.  Gi-hun's journey, which had once been the emotional anchor of the series, felt completely derailed. His motivations in this season were inconsistent, and his arc, which once symbolized hope and resistance, was reduced to impulsive actions with little emotional payoff. It was like watching a completely different character. One can only assume this was done to leave room for future spin-offs or tie-ins, but it came at the cost of character integrity.  Another issue that stood out was the over-reliance on international elements and forced global appeal. What started as a proudly Korean story steeped in cultural nuances began to lose its authenticity. The deeper philosophical undertones were overshadowed by unnecessary subplots and flashy sequences meant to keep the viewers ""entertained."" But in doing so, the show lost its heart. The message got diluted.  Perhaps the biggest letdown was the finale itself. A show like Squid Game deserved an ending that left viewers contemplating, mourning, and reflecting. Instead, we were given an ambiguous, almost nonsensical conclusion that felt more like a setup for another season than a satisfying resolution to the journey we've been on for three seasons. It felt like the creators forgot why we fell in love with the show in the first place.  It's always tough to watch a show you once loved take a turn like this. There's a kind of grief attached to it-the grief of lost potential, of characters who deserved better, and of a story that could have been a masterpiece from start to finish. Season 3 had glimpses of brilliance, moments where the original magic tried to shine through. But ultimately, it couldn't escape the weight of its own ambition.  In the end, Squid Game Season 3 didn't feel like the conclusion to a powerful story. It felt like a betrayal of everything it once stood for. And that is what hurts the most."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,2,,"Squid Game Season 2 fails to live up to the thrilling and thought-provoking storytelling of its predecessor. The season is bogged down by a sluggish pace, with much of its runtime dedicated to tedious setup rather than engaging character development or exciting twists. While the game sequences retain some of the tension and creativity that made the first season a global phenomenon, they are too few and far between to salvage this installment.  One glaring flaw comes in Episode 7 at 22:39, where the cameraman is clearly visible. This kind of oversight is unprofessional and detracts from the immersion of the series, a surprising lapse for a show of this caliber.  The ""season"" ends abruptly, with little resolution, clearly designed as a prelude to Season 3. This approach feels more like an extended prologue than a full-fledged season, leaving viewers frustrated and unfulfilled. Instead of being marketed as Season 2, it might have been more honest to call it Part 1 of a two-part continuation.  Fans of Squid Game deserved more than a drawn-out buildup with minimal payoff. While the production values remain high, such missteps make this season feel like a wasted opportunity. Here's hoping Season 3 can redeem it."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"This show is amazing from action scenes, to thriller, horror, cliffhangers. ALL THE ABOVE this show has it all. It's mysterious I highly recommend it. It can get violent and some nude scenes but a great show. Only thing I do not like about the show is the dubbed version it sounds a little funny. But can't help it it's just Korean. No big deal besides that no complaints this show gets better and better each episode hope season 3 is just as good as the rest of them are. The acting is 10/10 writing 9/10 story 9/10 overall the story and show is a masterpiece and highly recommend it if your a big thriller fan 10/10."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Saying it exceeded expectations isn't really saying much because for the longest time I avoided the show thinking it was some sort of cheesy game show like Survivor but with manufactured drama. It has elements of each but it is so much more with the psychological angle addressing human nature and the inherent desperation, greed, integrity and courage that every person has to some degree. I binged all 3 seasons and was impressed with all 3 although 2 and 3 are really just one season. But, episode 6 in season 1 had me in tears with a few different scenes. I rarely get choked up but the 3 scenes got to me and one in particular is still on my mind and I'm not sure I'll be able to let it go (the 2 female competitors). Anyway, I thought it was creative and clever even when extremely cruel. One of the best programs I've ever watched."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"Very compelling opening episodes, but when the actual plot unravels it makes you go, ""Oh, that's just it? That's kinda lame"". Great acting still, amazing sets, overrides the glaring flaws of the series, an enjoyable watch overall. 7/10."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"I originally gave Squid Game a solid 9/10. The first season was gripping, original, and emotionally powerful - a truly groundbreaking piece of television that deserved all the praise it received.  Unfortunately, the final season (or the most recent one) was a huge letdown. It lacked the tension, depth, and tight storytelling that made Season 1 so remarkable. Characters felt less compelling, the plot dragged in places, and it seemed more focused on spectacle than substance.  Because of that disappointing turn, I've lowered my score to a 7. I still deeply respect the first season and believe it's worth watching, but the follow-up left a sour taste that's hard to ignore."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Korean Hunger Games with better acting and much more relatable themes. The plot allegory focuses on the rampant exploitation of poor and desperate people, with the initial invitation to play the game and everything that follows appealing to their need to clear debts. This soon becomes about something much bigger and darker. Not for the squeamish.  No spoilers, but I will say I'm a vehement anti-binger when it comes to my viewing habits. In the 10-odd hour runtime of this series, though, I stopped only to sleep and make a chicken wrap."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"I really enjoyed Squid Game Season 1 - the concept was fresh, intense, and emotionally gripping. The characters were well-developed, and the story kept me hooked till the end.  However, Season 2 has been a major disappointment so far. The writing feels lazy, with recycled ideas and poorly thought-out plotlines. For example, in the second game, giving every team just 5 minutes to complete all five games made absolutely no sense - it felt completely illogical and forced. The scripted voting sequences also lacked depth and felt unnatural.  After watching a few episodes, I genuinely asked myself if I should even continue watching. It's frustrating to see such a promising show fall into the trap of weak, repetitive scripting. Hoping it improves, but Season 2 so far lacks the sharpness and impact that made Season 1 so memorable."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,2,,"Season 1 was a solid 8/10. It has lots of suspense, even with the cheesy vip characters acting and the easy-to-see plot twists.  Season 2 however is a nightmare. It really feels sloppily put together in typical netflix fashion. Would it really be a korean game of life and death without a token trans character learning about their body? How silly could you have made that side plot? They even had to throw in the trans-woman going to the female restroom scene, just to make a point. Absolute insanity. It was interesting to see some of the twists, but overall the side drama ruined it. It felt more like a persuasive essay on forced morality than a show about greed and death."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"This series is so overrated. But let's be fair, it's a very good series. I've watched a few movies about it. The script was good. Acting was sometimes exaggerated, maybe it's a cultural thing. I did not like the final part. Overall very well done. In the final episode, my expectation was different. But the final scene was disappointing. Season 2 will come, I hope it doesn't fall into ""La Casa De Papel"" status."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"What's up with all the series this 2024? Why are they all so fond of cliffhangers? I can't believe we waited years just to have that...  Like, the second season of the show really did a good job in continuing the fun, emotional, and intense feelings from the previous one; the performances are also outstanding, including the concepts, chemistry, production, and all, but the remaining scenes just didn't do it for me, like what happened?  I know it's a tease for what's to come, but it's also not a great one to be, like, that's it, really? I guess folks need to wait again for a long time, so yeah, there's that."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Squid game has set an extremely high bar for other shows of this genre. It is intense. It is raw. It is an emotional roller coaster. This is a masterpiece throughout. I actually felt that the poor VIP acting was a good metaphor of modern Hollywood when compared to the incredible performances by some of the main cast members here. I sincerely hope they continue the series in the same style and it does not get the SAW franchise treatment.  But Episode 6 - Gganbu.... So powerful. Possibly the best single episode of a show I have ever seen.  More, more, more please."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Great plot, great acting, and all around great show. One of the best series I've seen on netflix in a very long time. Korean cinema is absolutely the best with their story telling. 10/10!!"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"I would give the original series 8 to 8.5. If you don't know, the way Korean TV works is that you do one limited series and then you move onto the next project. It could be eight episodes, it could be 12 but it doesn't really run much longer than that. Therefore, when the Korean makers of the original series submitted it Netflix knew they had something interesting but they didn't know they had a cultural phenomenon. Once it blew up, the demand was for more which is not what the makers had in mind.  Series 2 and three are actually one long series. The first series was around one single tournament of the titular games. This time you get one tournament split over two seasons. Leading to a lot of filler.  The original series is high concept but to keep things going ridiculous plots vie for position with ludicrous plot twists and illogical actions. All TV and movies are artificial and designed to provoke an emotional response. But bad TV shows are where you can hear the writing and you can tell that the only reason why a character is acting against their own interests is because the writer needs to get them to a certain position. This happens way too often particularly in season three.  Season two is the bridge season and I gave it a pass because I wanted to see where it was going. However, once you're into season three you realise the writers didn't quite know how to stick the landing. There's lots going on, but sometimes it seems like it's drama for drama's sake. So as you sit there frustratedly watching the final few scenes, you realise this should've been one and done and it would've been remembered as one of the great Korean exports.  Season 1- 8.5 Season 2- 7 Season 3- 5."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"Season 1 was near perfection. The plot was fresh, shockingly good and hit the emotional tone just right. Often times it felt too realistic and the acting was on point as well. And the games were well executed. They should have ended the series there. Rating: 9/10.  Season 2 only exists because season 1 was a massive hit and Netflix wanted more. The plot this time around was weaker than before. The shock value has gone and the emotional notes did not quite hit the same. Some new characters were genuinely good. Overall a good season nevertheless. Rating: 8/10.  Season 3 was basically season 2 second part. They just stretched a weaker story so much it loses the charm. One sub-plot (detective island hunt) felt exciting in the beginning but went nowhere. The other sub-plot (rogue soldier) was unnecessary and I did not like it. The drama within the players was not as exciting as season 1. And was predictable at times. Once again, brilliant acting carried the series, except the VIPs. They were hilariously bad. The new games and voting system did not have the same weight as before. Tho, these did add some drama. Finally, regarding the ending, I have mixed feeling about it. Rating: 7/10."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"Disappointing. Really, really disappointing. Season 2 doesn't even come close to the brilliance of Season 1.  And the most absurd part? The main character falling for the exact same trick his ""best friend"" pulled on him three years ago. Like, seriously? That's Horror Movie Mistakes 101.  It feels like they took a regular season and stretched it like a piece of gum to make it last for two seasons. And even then, this feels like the first half of a 14-episode series that they'll finish next year. Honestly, they should've just condensed the whole thing into 7 solid episodes and called it a day.  The games? They're fine. Not amazing, not terrible-just ""meh."" Half the ""special guest appearances"" are so obscure, you'd only recognize them if you're a hardcore Korean drama fan who goes, ""Oh my god, it's Park Sun-Hoon in a cameo! Epic!"" Yeah, not me  The story is basically copy-pasted from Season 1 with nothing new to offer.  It's cute in some moments but incredibly disappointing overall. A generous 6/10 from me.  Mainly for season 1 Watch it if you must, but don't expect much except some recycled drama and half-baked games."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,5,,"They should have cut at least half of it. It drags on and on. After the incredible momentum the second season built, this is a letdown. The worst thing about it are the actors playing the rich people. They look like a bunch of people that stumbled into their first improv-lesson: over-acting to degree that left me with so much 2nd-hand embarrassment that I started skipping the scenes. Remember the villains laughing in Austin Powers? Now imagine that but with complete amateurs.  The rest of it feels drawn out. This could have easily been resolved with two seasons instead of three. The pacing blunts the emotional impact when some of the main characters die.  This could have been so much better..."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"The games ar nothing but a real life projection, ""a democracy"" based on rules made by capitalism, no one takes it seriously until you need money... you work with no limits and you never find happiness... try to look different into this movie and you will find the true message, true about rules in society, about democracy, and how people change themselves how money can change someone, overall great story, great idea."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"I just watched whole S3, while yes i did speed it abit. While as an editor, i have to summary it, the director said ""S3 is the end, there wont be a S4 - and citing a lack of ideation. While S1 was three years ago, and 22episodes in total, the story feels pretty tapped out""  But if you've watched S3Ep6, clearly there'll be S4, you'll probably catches many changed, like the edit feels altered, some shots missing and a sudden ""6 months ago"" time jump, and that mystery young man. Sure the episode has some reshoots and retape, and its continuable.  Its whether change a new director?? Or selling IP?? Since its a good IP, from a business perspective, there's no way such a strong IP just ends like that. Whether it's in the story or behind; in-or-outside the scenes, this is all part of the capitalist game - just like Jigsaw, Final Destination, or Scream (which is getting a Season 7 in 2026). These are a good IP to run, so it definitely will be S4."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"The show has themes and ideas that convey intense meaning. It gives joy and laughter, and every character is thought out to great detail. Keeps you on the edge and wanting more. You'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll feel for character's as if you were them. Absolutely wanting and looking foward to a season 2. Brilliant."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"Squid Game's first season is undeniably compelling, though far from a masterpiece. Its gripping premise, engaging challenges, and intriguing characters promise a vast well of potential. Unfortunately, the second season drags down the series, feeling forced and short on fresh ideas-seemingly a Netflix cash grab with a heavy-handed agenda. The director himself hinted at the show's natural conclusion after Season One, but the sequel charges ahead regardless.  While the initial episodes of Season Two show some promise, everything beyond episode three becomes predictable and dull. The new characters stray too far from the solid casting of the first installment, often feeling annoying and stereotypical. Conversations grow tedious, and the tension that once made the show exhilarating fades quickly. Though there are a few decent moments scattered throughout, the overall result is mediocre at best. In sum, Season One stands out as a must-watch, whereas Season Two falls disappointingly short of its predecessor's impact."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,This is honestly the best series i have ever watched i finished it in one night and now i cant stop thinking about it everything about it is perfect the storyline the events are not exepcted a lot of plot twists i have every single emotion watching this stress anxiety anger happy and i mean it i will never regret watching it good job.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"OK Season 1 had nice and unique storyline, proper suspence. Season 1 had very best characters carried the plot. I watchbased on mystery that needs to be revealed but experienced irony.  Season 2 revealed all the mystery in the beginning of season 1 and made the drama to perform. What is the point, tried to put some emotion which is of no use. Waited for banger end up getting blunder. Season 1 would rate highly but season 2 is very average. Please make it gripping and interesting in season 3.  For binge watchers, I dont think you find it very interesting to watch, but give a try for s2. But S1 is really good, I can bet on it."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,It was so intresting that i finished all in 1 day.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"Creator and director Dong-hyuk Hwang certainly had one crazy vision, and successfully made a series of it. Sure it has plot and technical issues, and I wasn't fond of the ending - I re-wrote it in my head much better, but for a somewhat newb Korean filmmaker, this was epic.  The visuals, props and sets were outstanding. The cinematography and score amazing. The casting and performances by all, except the VIP's, was excellent. Props to Neflix once again, and thanks for dubbing this one right this time. Hoping for a S2 real soon. A well deserved 8/10 from me."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,Omg ! A Must watch! First episode is Fantastic! Do not miss it. Absolute Gore fun. Delivers what it promises!! Man I don't usually comment but this is Epic!
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Squid Game (2021-2025) is one of those shows that people have been raving about for years and it took me forever to watch because of my busy schedule, but I did finally watch both seasons of the show at the end of last year and I really enjoyed this show. Now that I have watched Season 3, I can say that this show is truly one of a kind.  Positives for Squid Game (2021-2025): The premise of this show is the thing that had me intrigue and it is one of those shows that caught my attention and it delivered on all of my expectations. This is a show that is so bleak with its tone and approach that you need someone who can understand how to execute it properly and Hwang Dong-hyuk is the person. He understood what needed to be done with this show and how to make it work for modern day audiences while also giving it an edge to make it stand out from a lot of other shows. The cast is phenomenal here with Lee Jung-jae, Lee Byung-hun, Wi Ha-joon, Park Hae-soo, Jung Ho-yeon, Im Si-wan, Jo Yu-ri and Park Sung-hoon as they plays these people who feel so real that you want to see them get out of this insane game alive and it is sad when you see these people meet their fates in the most terrible ways possible. The games we see in this show are the kind of games you would see children play except they are taken to the extreme with the high stakes and sheer brutality with how these players are being eliminated and it is so chilling with the gory. The people behind the concept of these games are your typical cartoon villains, but they are entertaining with their personalities that I came to enjoy them for their insanity. This show does a great job at executing the story in these three seasons that I can't help but applaud the creator for his work. And finally, the ending of this show is one of the best in television history, but it is also one of those finales that will divide audiences with the things that happen and I can understand their reasons for hating, but I loved it.  Overall, Squid Game (2021-2025) is a once in a generation show that need to be watched by everyone for the experience itself and it is one of the best shows during the modern era of television and I am happy to have taken part in this experience with everyone."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,I really enjoy every second of this TV show it's so perfect and amazing it deserves 10 out of 10.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"Compelling, iam have way thru didn't got boring once so far. Nice designs, graphics and characters. Worth the watch for sure."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,5,,"Well, Squid Game would have been a 10 out of 10 if it had ended after the first season, and it definitely should have. But since the whole series has to be considered, there's a massive point deduction because seasons 2 and 3 were both an absolute disaster. As a result, the show doesn't even qualify as 'pretty good' anymore; it's just 'meh' at best.  Seasons 2 and 3 added absolutely nothing, and I mean really nothing, to the series. Not a single new or original idea. None of the many questions were answered. Nothing the audience had hoped for actually happened. The series basically ends just as abruptly as it did after season 2. And before anyone says, 'The show probably isn't over yet' - it is. It was one of the worst follow-ups to a series ever, which is insane considering how reliably strong Korean dramas usually are and how incredibly solid the foundation was that season 1 built.  Really a shame. I can probably count on one hand the number of shows that would have been better if they had ended after season one. I don't understand why they even continued the series if they clearly had no ideas left."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Same category as Breaking Bad, very very very good. Movies like this arent made that often. It's got to be your kind of.movie, I'm sure not everyone's cup of tea, but if you watch at least 3 episodes you will finish it. Especially created a IMDB account to rate this series. Says enough I think. Go watch it!"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"H Review:  For me, Squid Game was an intense and shocking experience. The deadly game isn't just about survival-it explores greed, desire, hope, and moral choices of human beings. The characters are realistic and multi-dimensional, showing how people behave under extreme circumstances. The games, cleverly and frighteningly designed, create a constant sense of anxiety, drawing the viewer deep into the story. The music, color palette, and atmosphere make the series a unique and captivating experience. Squid Game symbolizes struggle, humanity, and unforgettable thrilling television memories for me."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Forgive me for the title, i could not come up with anything more creative, that's on me. This is a serious review, let me be clear.  Squid game is such a thoughtful and detailed show, it's hard to know where to begin discussing it. The writing is done with passion, the characters are created with love, and every set and costume is built with deep intention.  The premise is pretty simple. Struggling people compete for money. The show's brilliance lies beyond its premise though.  The show itself is a commentary on the ultra wealthy 1% and how they treat people who aren't as successful as they are. They treat the poorer like how kings treat jesters, laughing in the face of their financial struggles. The message isn't meant to be direct, it's meant to be hidden beneath layers of metaphor and subtext- something i've seen a lot of reviewers here not pick up on.  But commenting on capitalism isn't all the show has to offer, it also has themes about interpersonal connection and trust. Do we trust those who are accomplished on their own, or do we trust those who can accomplish great things with others? How much money is enough to be willing to die for? Who would you be wiling to hurt in order to elevate your own life? Director hwang dong-hyuk did such an amazing job exploring questions like these.  No characters feel like copies of each other, they're all different enough from each other to make a good story without being unrealistic. Our main character, seong gi-hun, is really admirable. He's kind, thoughtful, and dedicated to others, no matter the circumstance. He's shown to be empathetic, even when faced with the possibility of death, which is just such a power move.  Yes, it's bloody, and yes, it can be over the top with the murder factor, but if you look beneath the gore, you'll see a genuine show, created with unbelievable levels of effort and passion. I'm truthful when i say i don't think there are any bad episodes of squid game.  I've seen some reviews saying this show glorifies death, but that can't be further from the truth. Squid game shows a lot of people die, a lot of very different people, to show that no matter what you do, no matter who you are, no matter how hard you try in life, you're damned. The show wants you to feel bad when desperate people in need of money force themself into such an awful situation that they're willing to die and kill for cash.  And only 3 seasons, thank goodness. I am so glad that netflix didn't demand more expansion like they did with stranger things.  As my closing statement, i'll say this: i know this show is good because it made my mother cry, and that woman is strong as steel."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"The first couple of episodes a very well done and pack a punch, but by the end it just seems to run out of steam. The marbles episode was the last real swerve, after that it becomes paint by numbers to the point that I started fast forwarding through most of it just to get it to end.  Early episodes are an eight, final episodes are a three."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"And because that rhymed I'll keep it going that way and to reiterate, I gotta say The episodes in the middle of the show are probably the strongest I ever saw of any tv series - forgein or domestic.  But in general - this show was majestic.  Character development is really great I cared for them quickly instead of late.  And to make them easier to differentiate, they even gave them numbers like 2-1-8.  The last 2 episodes fell off a little bit, but they're still good - not saying they're ... I think this production is the best to ever come out of Asia where the acting's usually dumb and over the top.  Here some of Asia's finest acting is displayed I really like how their characters are portrayed.  I'm late to the party, after the hype has died but let me close saying the hype was justified."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"The creator of the show had confirmed that season 3 is the last season of the show.  I completed the whole show and it was brilliant but the story of the show hadn't completed and leave a lot of questions like: Q: who created the games?  Q: what is the philosophy of the games?  Q: who's the VIPs? Did they created games?  Q: what the front man(captain) did? Did he betrayed the masters? Is he regret what he did?  Besides this the show is full of emotions and trauma. It portrayed very beautifully the nature of humans.  Although it is one the best Korean netflix show.  The final scene suggests that the game isn't over, just shifted to another location, probably US."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,3,,"Personally Squid Game became one of my favorite TV shows back in 2021, but season 2 didn't make the pass. They repeated almost the exact same formula and characters apart of some very few things they added. You can't connect with most of the new characters since most of them have very little screentime or are killed off almost immediately, plus most of them are written off to be complete jerks or unlikable. It's disappointing that a series spend 3 years in production and they give us this, yet is even more ridiculous they want us to await for almost one whole year more to release the spare episodes, like ¿are you kidding me? ¿really Netflix? Season 1 is 8/10, season 2 a 3/10."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"Extremely great and innovative. This film is frighteningly real and all of the performances of the actors are stellar and force you to not only be glued to the screen but to also carry the weight and feelings and emotions of the show with you for a little or sometimes long while after the episode has finished. Not sure if this was initially released weekly but I cannot even imagine the torture of that had I tried to watch it at the time it came out. It is very difficult to stop watching but also I was sometimes forced to because it became too emotional and invasive to me. Great work from director, actor's and whole crew as well as extras and extras casting. Great experience that won't leave you for a long time."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"Even though there are many gameshows that require contestants to survive for one reason or another, Squid Game stands out thanks to its breathtaking visuals and superbly written characters. The former is done through colorful scenery that perfectly fits the ""kids games"" theme as well as the organized nature of a secretive organization's facility that houses so many people. As for the latter, EVERY character is struggling to make ends meet but how they put themselves in that position is extremely unique. The group is diverse with the main guy having to pay a debt he owes to land sharks, his friend having embezzled money from his business, an old man who is living out his remaining time with a brain tumor, a gangster who stole money from his boss, a woman who got scammed and more. Add to that the dark humor, an unraveling mystery surrounding the game show, and violence and you have the recipe for an addictively bingeable show."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"I genuinely enjoyed this show from beginning to end. A true social commentary on humanity, competition and avarice. When the carnage is occurring it's nail-biting and between the games you get compelling human drama - a fantastic addition to the ""kill game"" genre that seems to always be elevated by Korean talent behind and in front of the camera.  Updated: Season 3 is disappointing. The story feels aimless, and none of the characters are likable or even sympathetic. The emotional weight from earlier seasons is gone. The ending was especially bad, like a rushed setup for some kind of American spin-off. And honestly, the scariest part wasn't the games... it was the VIPs speaking English like it was their first time using the language. This season had potential, but it felt more like a cash grab than a meaningful continuation."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"It's true. The more the sequels, the lesser the quality of the sequel. Season 1 was fire, got us so hooked. Season 2, good. But season 3, nope. They got lazy ( 1 less episode than season 2). In a rush of finishing the series, they didn't even bother with ethics nor the fact that 456's intent was to defy and destroy the criminal organization. Maybe they had a deadline, or they were running out of budget. They eliminated a lot of the interesting people on the show. Maybe those people were big actors/actresses thus the elimination. Well, that's squid game for you. But that finale though, very lazy , some creativity would have been nice. It looked as though they just mashed everything up so that the finale is long."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"I LOVED this show, you can binge-watch it, it's addictive.  I don't like horror and blood, but this one was more of a thriller-suspense, even I liked it.  It's a mix of: the chess scene from the first Harry Potter, Black Mirror and The platform.  It's very hard to guess what's coming next, it keeps you interested and guessing."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"Season 1 of Squid Game was a masterclass in storytelling - raw, original, and emotionally powerful. Unfortunately, what followed is a textbook example of what happens when profit overshadows purpose.  Season 2 abandons the narrative integrity that made the first season resonate, offering instead a disjointed and uninspired continuation. Season 3 goes even further - a grotesque distortion of the original vision, pandering to shock value rather than substance.  What could have ended as a cultural landmark is now diluted by the very greed the show once criticized. Sometimes, ""more"" is simply too much."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"Squid Game is a fascinating and visually stunning series that left me thoroughly impressed. The show's unique premise, coupled with its masterful execution, made it an unforgettable experience.  One of the standout elements is its visual appeal-vibrant, surreal settings juxtaposed against the grim reality of life-and-death stakes. The games themselves were meticulously designed to evoke genuine tension and unpredictability, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats. The high stakes, where failure meant death, added an unparalleled intensity to every scene.  On a psychological level, Squid Game delves into the darkest corners of human nature. It explores themes of greed and ambition, showcasing how far individuals are willing to go-even at the expense of others' lives-for a chance at wealth. Another compelling theme is the moral dilemmas faced when survival becomes personal; the series starkly illustrates how self-preservation can lead one to betray even their closest allies.  However, while the series excels in many areas, the ending left much to be desired. The conclusion felt open-ended and unresolved, leaving several critical questions unanswered. It's clear the story has more to offer, and I can only hope that the next season will address these lingering threads.  Overall, Squid Game is a phenomenal series that masterfully combines suspense, social commentary, and visual artistry. I thoroughly enjoyed it and eagerly anticipate what comes next!"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"Overall i'd say this show deserves an 8.5 for season 1.  It seems like they made season 2 with a lot of greed. They made 10 episodes. They then made filler story for 4 extra episodes (14 total) and split it into 2 seasons.  This is the same thing that ruined the Hobbit and the Hunger Games. Those movies are still fine, but so much potential was wasted just to make some extra money. If those movies had 1 less movie, they'd be so much better.  We now have 2 shorter seasons of 7 episodes with a lot of filler moments. It's a shame because season 1 was very packed with a good story. Now it drags on a lot of times in season 2. Not to mention that the story cuts of literally in the middle of the story.  It was very obviously forced into 2 seasons just so Netflix could ride the succes of the show for longer. It really is a shame. I wish we could just tell a good story and end it on a high note. Milking popular shows dry is a shame. It ruins any rewatch potential in the future."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"As another review says, the VIPs acting is not bad. The only reason native English speakers find it bad is because they speak very slowly and clear, as the show is not intended for English speakers.  I usually check reviews on FilmAffinity, (the Spanish version) and literally no one there was talking about how bad the VIPs were. So, for Spanish speakers, the acting doesn't seem bad. It is as simple as that.  As for the show, it is a great show. I strongly recommend watching it.  Maybe not a 10/10 as that is reserved for films that changed my life, but definitely a 8/10.  It is a great metaphor of capitalism and how our society forces people into extreme situations."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Absolutely brilliant! Loved it from start to finish, excellent acting (apart from the American actors at the end! Dreadful) Great story, had me hooked.. binged watched the lot!  Looks like they'll be a second series which I can't wait to see! Superb."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,I m speechlesss. Love this series.. One of the best.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"I cannot praise this series enough. At first, I didn't like some of the over-reaction from many of the characters but this might just be my own cultural failings. But, I loved the way the characters developed and interacted, their differing views and what they each 'brought' to the series. I agree with the other reviewers that E6 is just superb - it is a masterpiece of story telling in a way that Hollywood tends to forget. The acting was so good. All in all, this series has totally entertained me and surpassed my expectations. Thoroughly recommended."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"Decent set deco .  Battle royal flavors.  A bit long in runtime, especially after first half.  Very bloody and gory at times.  Addictive if thats your cup of tv tea."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,I like it so so much ... It was the first to end in first day ... But i think there will be season 2 bcs its not completed ... I hope its near bcs i can't wait.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"The show was great... up until the director/creator gave up on the 3rd season. I heard he said he lost teeth because he was so stressed out about the show, but wow, everything went downhill with the last season. The whole buildup of characters and their background was just thrown away. You follow them through all of season 2, but then you are completely disappointed right when season 3 starts. Seriously, why?!?!  I'm guessing because the director didn't want to do it any more but Netflix wants to capitalize on the name, the director gave up on the show and just ended it horribly to give it a bad taste in our mouth. I wonder if Netflix can make the US version better."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"This series is beautifully produced and directed. So many stories with in itself and has drama, action, suspence. I couldn't stop watching it. I hope they do a second season, or add more episodes.  Beware parents not for children, lots of death, gore, blood, simulated dead bodies, violence."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"This series is exceptional. It poses a narrative which delves into the human psyche. Themes of duality, choice, power and control are played out within the game. The series is analysing socio-political, gender and class binaries within stunning scenography, beautiful symbology and a compelling story line.  I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Battle Royale, or Asian Tartan Extreme films."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,I really liked season 1 of squid game because the storyline was wrapped up in 1 season. Season 2 & 3 are a combination of 1 squid game. They've put too much unnecessary drama in each episode. I find myself actually yelling at the characters and getting frustrated. I've got 1 episode left to watch and I have no idea if there will be an actual ending or if I will have to wait for another season to see if the detective ever finds the island. If there's a season 4 I hope they go back to the way they did things in season 1. I had higher hopes for this since I love korean dramas. Also the VIP actors are horrible.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"The Netflix subscription is $9 but the therapy you'll need after this show is priceless.  To sum it up as briefly as possible, it's like a sundae made of scoops of Shawshank Redemption, The Purge, and the first Saw movie, with a little bit of Star Wars sprinkled on top."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,Quite the unique show. I was hooked from the first episode. Haven't binged something in a long time but could not stop this one. Totally out of the box creatively. Loved it. Give it a watch.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"A series or movie that makes time pass quickly because you're so into it is greatly appreciated by me. So many titles to choose from but only a few leave you with a feeling of satisfaction after viewing. Several Korean series hit that mark, Vagabond, Kingdom, Tunnel, to name a few. The only problem I have is with scenes that go on way to long, Nine episodes could've been cut to six with some efficient editing but other than that I loved it."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"A great concept here as desperate people with financial problems compete for a huge sum of money(apparently $38 mil American). They must play games against one another with a severe penalty for losing. Like the Sopranos, with some of the episodes better than others. Number six was the best for me. The sets are Wes Anderson like, with bright colors filling the screen. The lead actors are excellent and the scripts very well written. The violence is over the top with no comic relief in sight. The final episode was a bit of a letdown but overall I was highly entertained."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"This show was amazing, apart from the thrill, drama and violence, it tried to show the social inequalities that people have to live with and they fight to survive! Yet another Korean masterpiece."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"While I do give Squid Game credit for it's inivative and interesting premise, the film has an underlying issue of direction and overall moral message. The problem occurs more frequently in season 2 when the main cast struggles to find a singular goal or overall personality. The acting has greatly declined in season 2. The director said that there was no plans of a season 2 while they filmed season 1 and it is pretty obvious as each episode consists of patternistic fighting, consuling, and retribution. The overall goal of season 2 is revenge on the man but it takes multiple detours and becomes a disshovled soap opera. The strengths come late for season 2 as the final 2 episodes hold the most impact while not as much as season 1 does it still gives you a reward for sitting through its runtime. One recommendation is that you should watch it with only subtitles and not dubbed over."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Simply immersive. Thats my general consensus. I am only up to episode 4?(i am binging it so lost track) but this is almost meditative - the scope of this. The filmaking is on another level. Its so revolutionary, everything in it. Dont want to spoil it. Must watch..  the acting is just superb and it will keep you guessing.  The genre not to spoil is mystery/dystopia."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"The series starts strong and gradually declines. The first season is quite good - it presents a very interesting new concept. I believe that's what created the initial impact and gave it its popularity.  The acting is honestly weak, if not outright bad, but as I mentioned, the novelty factor manages to keep the viewer entertained.  The following seasons continue with the poor performances and lose the freshness of the original idea. I think that's why the show starts to feel like it's going downhill. The novelty wears off, the plot isn't particularly engaging beyond the world it introduces, and it ends up exhausting the viewer.  In fact, some of the situations in the later seasons feel so forced they come off as downright bizarre. I didn't like the ending."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,1,,"I went into Season 3 hoping for a return to what made the series awesome. Unfortunately, this season fell completely flat for me. First of all the acting of the VIPS was so bad forced and overly dramatic, also they just simply could not act, they did not seem like rich people or better said vips.  The plot was even more confusing character motivations were all over the place, and major twists seemed thrown in just for shock value rather than story logic. Since they changed characters like 388 COMPLETELY, I kept waiting for a deeper message or narrative thread to tie it all together, but it never came. Compared to the suspenseful writing of Season 1, this felt messy and rushed. Honestly, unless you're watching just to finish the series, I really wouldn't recommend it."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,,,"Nihilistic. Depraved. Pointless.  Squid Game pretends to be a critique of capitalism, but it's a lie-an empty shell wrapped in stylized gore and cheap moral theater. There's no compass here. No resistance. No guide through the nightmare. Just suffering, stacked on more suffering, offered up for consumption like bread and circuses in a neon hell.  Unlike Dante's descent in The Inferno, there's no Virgil, no redemption, no reckoning-just a rigged system and characters who either die or comply. No one rises. No one fights back. The game isn't a metaphor. It's a meat grinder.  Compared to Silence of the Lambs, this thing lacks any psychological depth or truth. Clarice chased justice. These people just get herded toward slaughter, framed as spectacle. It's not commentary. It's cruelty dressed up as significance.  A soulless diatribe of falsehoods wrapped in violence, screaming into the wind, signifying nothing.  I turned it off. I won't be back. And I won't pretend there's meaning in the mess."

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,4,,"""Squid Game"" had all the ingredients to become an iconic series, but it falters in its execution due to predictable storytelling, lazy writing, and inconsistent logic. While the premise is intriguing-a deadly game where players compete for survival-the show struggles to maintain its momentum and emotional weight.  One of the major flaws is its predictability. Key plot twists and character arcs can be spotted a mile away, making the tension and suspense feel hollow. Instead of keeping the audience on edge, the series often telegraphs its moves, reducing the impact of pivotal moments.  The writing, unfortunately, leans on convenience rather than depth. There are numerous contradictions in the story, particularly around the rules of the games. For example, players are explicitly told they cannot influence voting, yet the show repeatedly bends these rules for the sake of lazy dialogue or manufactured drama. This lack of consistency undermines the believability of the narrative and pulls viewers out of the experience.  Conversations in the series often drag on unnecessarily. Instead of building tension or deepening character relationships, they feel like filler. Dialogue is repetitive and lacks the sharpness needed to elevate the characters or the story. As a result, emotional moments that should hit hard fall flat, leaving little lasting impact.  While the show occasionally delivers moments of visual intrigue and social commentary, the lack of emotional depth and clumsy pacing makes it feel like a missed opportunity. ""Squid Game"" is entertaining in parts, but it fails to live up to the potential of its concept, leaving viewers with a series that is more frustrating than satisfying."

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"This is a series from South Korea in mainly the Korean language I am 99% sure the reason why the VIPs are talking the way they are is because of this They are not acting bad, the acting is fine! What feels amiss to us is that they talk slowly and pronounce very clearly, and this is deliberate. They speak slowly and clearly because this show was intended for a Korean audience and not an US or even English speaking audience and this is why it feels kinda off to those people We are used to Netflix shows in US or British English where people speak perfect everyday English (whatever that means) and here they tried to ensure a non English speaker or someone with limited English skills can follow the VIP conversations This is my theory I said what I said Love this series and it's the best thing that's come off Netflix in a while so think for a minute and stop hating on this detail in an otherwise AWESOME show!"

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"To be honest the hype is way overrated. It's good on the first season but the season 2 and season 3 is clearly dragged. Season 2 and 3 is not well written. They fail to make the story become deeper and the other characters seriously become useless like the police finding the island all season long. There's only one noticeable character here aside from the main lead. The rest is really uselss The protagonists is the generic type of protagonists that all they do is blabbering  If you watch alot of korean movie, they like to make the characters talk a lot. They even talk to themselves.  They should focus instead in the games as it is the highlights of the movie."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"If you're on the fence, definitely give the show a try. I wasn't sure what to expect, but it's definitely in my ""all-time favorites"" now.  It was a really good show until one of the episodes, which elevated the show to the next level and cemented its place on my all-time favorites list. I would have given the series a 10, but I was disappointed with the ending, which is why I lowered the score to a 9.  Despite the ending, I consider it a must watch, or at the very least, a must try."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,1,,"Squid Game Season 3 is a complete disappointment. The main character, after all the emotional buildup from previous seasons, returns only to do absolutely nothing. His presence is irrelevant and he ends up being just another spectator, with no real impact on the story. Why did he even come back? The guy on the boat, another character who seemed important, also adds nothing. The entire season builds expectations that are never fulfilled. The pacing is slow, the new characters fail to connect, and the ending is terrible: no consequences, no surprises, no soul. All the potential was wasted in a script with no direction or purpose. A true betrayal to the fan, is horrible."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"When I first saw season 1 after it came out, I already loved the show and it's vibe, until the internet kinda ruined Squid Game's image. Now most just think of the silly life or death games when they hear Squid Game, but I feel like people are missing out on the show. (I might be wrong, I just don't know anyone that genuinely enjoyed the show)  Season 1 starts off strong. Likeable characters, thrilling sequences, great overall vibe and pacing,.. It's the reason it got so popular anyways. Some might find season 1 a bit less to their liking, which I get. The beginning and ending are a bit slowly paced, and sometimes the show itself got a little unhinged. Apart from that, season 1 is great when it comes to setting up the ending and the start of season 2.  Season 2 starts off, again, slowly paced, but for a good reason. It sets the tone and the actions of our characters well. Some might not like the slow pace, which I get, (because we don't get to the games instantly) but they did very well for me.  When the games begin, the show got its season 1 vibe again. The new games, the (once again) great new characters, the emotion, the thrills,... I personally loved it through the whole thing. Apart from still having the season 1 vibe, it had its own ""charm"". The tone was different, which I think some might not like. For example, the setting isn't only the games itself, but also outside of that (sometimes) and the rules of the games changed a bit, but I think that opened up great new opportunities, and it delivered.  The ending was thrilling, but it missed that thrill that the games usually had. It had less impact on me than I thought. Still great to kick off season 3, I hope.  If you liked season 1, you will like season 2. If you think Squid Game is a silly show which just had impact on youtube shorts and brainrot content, reconsider."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Excellent show with incredible attention to detail on the psychology of different characters and how the relationships between these characters develop during the game. Definitely worth the binge in one night! The show is incredible in terms of scriptwriting AND acting and has an exciting unpredictability to it. Additionally, the soundtrack was brilliantly consistent and the repetitiveness helped tie all the episodes together.  The only element in this show which was slightly worse was the acting of the VIP's from episode 7 and onward. They weren't too bad, but their acting was noticeably worse than the Korean actors."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"After a three-year wait, Squid Game Season 2 finally arrived but unfortunately it left me underwhelmed. If I had to sum up my experience in one word, it would be really ""DISAPPOINTMENT."" The first season was a masterclass in simplicity, suspense and emotional resonance which contributed to its massive popularity. Naturally, my expectations for Season 2 were sky-high. Sadly, the new installment lacked the very elements that made its predecessor so compelling. The creator's vision for Season 2 seemed unclear and the show meandered losing focus. The initial episodes were slow-paced with excessive conversations that could have been condensed. The character development while detailed felt unnecessary and overshadowed the main plot.  The new characters introduced in Season 2 failed to resonate emotionally, leaving me feeling detached. The games which were supposed to be the highlight were poorly executed and lacked the emotional impact I had anticipated. It seemed like the show's creators were more concerned with showcasing their elaborate set designs and structured plot rather than delivering meaningful content. The result was a lackluster experience that culminated in a violent and unsatisfying conclusion.  On a positive note, the music and cinematography were impressive but these aspects alone couldn't redeem the season's shortcomings.  Overall, Squid Game Season 2 was a disappointment, failing to recapture the magic of its predecessor. Hoping that the creators will refocus for future installments.  Rating for season 2 --->> 3/10."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,Often tough to watch but a gripping series if you can see it out.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"I'm writing this review after seeing the second season of this show. I have to say that I do not agree with the growing opinion that the second season was a huge letdown and did not live up to the original. While I do think the first season told a more complete story with better pacing, I still believe with season 2 we are looking at an incomplete story, that should wait for the final one in order to be judged fairly.  The split, probably a Netflix ruling to retain subscriptions, was not perfectly placed, but I will refrain from holding it against the show, because so much of what it does holds true and retains the spirit of the first season.  Gi-Hun is back, and is after the managers of the game to put it to an end. The idea to put him back in the game is a contentious decision, but I do think that if he were to be left out, and we followed him solely trying to track down the game masters, without his presence among the players, the storyline of the games would have been less interesting, and would definitely have been a retread of the original.  As it is, it's interesting to have a former victor in the Games (there's a reason Catching Fire is the best Hunger Games book and movie). But the perk of having a victor inside the arena goes out quickly because the games change. Again, of course the games have to change, but it means that Gi-Hun loses his edge in a way that regresses his character.  They don't do a lot with him besides having him urge other players to stop playing and vote out after each game and take the money earned so far. Those two elements are the key fresh ideas that make the games feel new and not wholly Do-overs. It's a great idea to explore the gamble aspect of playing ""one more game"", because it goes deep into the Hot-Hand fallacy mentality of a degenerate gambler, which is what a lot of the players are, and one of the ways through which the game masters control them.  But it does mean that Gi-Hun has to leverage compelling points to urge them to stop, and the writers don't have him make great arguments, it's just a bit repetitive dialogue, but that also might be the result of poor subtitles. His dialogue might be more insightful when understood in the original Korean.  The other characters are great, they provide interesting archetypes that explore new angles of the downtrodden, that the first game didn't. Instead of husband and wife we have a mother and son, a pregnant girl, a trans woman, ex-militaries, online sensations, with even some interesting commentaries on social media finance gurus, which all work great.  Again, this is the best part of Squid Game, it's not the games themselves, it's what the Games have to reveal about these different people, how they portray themselves in the games, out of them, what makes them want to play and what makes them stop, and I think season 2 does this like season 1 did, it just does it in a manner that's incomplete.  There's a lot left to explore for every character in the show for Season 3. I will admit that there are structural issues because the storyline with the cop is pretty left to the wayside, the female guard we follow on the inside is also left hanging, and the subplot with the guards trafficking organs is also a bit half-baked, but I have faith in what they have in store, and to speak of what we have so far, I'm liking it.  Everyone in season 1 complained about the VIP's and there has been nothing nearly as bad as that in season 2, the VIP's haven't even showed up (though I think they should in season 3, just better done).  Finally, one key twist that is revealed early in season 2 is pretty interesting, intelligent and compelling. At first glance it might seem like a repeat of season 1 as well, but once you contemplate the ways in which it's different from season 1, it will be clear that it's a great move, that changes things dramatically, and that honestly, saves the season in my eyes."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"Was Season 3 worth the wait? Honestly, not really. It started with promise but quickly drifted into what felt like a drawn-out filler arc. The tension, the stakes, the clever writing that made previous seasons shine - it all took a back seat. Instead, we got a season full of empty build-up with barely any real payoff. By the time the finale came around, it was clear that the whole purpose was just to set up a new direction rather than give closure. And while setting up the future isn't always a bad thing, doing it at the cost of an entire season? That's a problem. They had the potential to dig deeper with smarter scenarios and tighter storytelling, but instead, it felt lazy - like they knew they'd already hooked us and didn't feel the need to try. A frustrating waste of momentum."

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"Korean Drama ""Squid Game"" is bloody, but, somehow, hopeful.  It has a nice cinematography, with, sometimes, overused gore, but well executed action scenes. The background stories, moreover, set the drama apart from the rest of the survival game series, and it gives a more 'Korean Drama' feel to it. It makes the story more believable, as it helps the viewer relate to the characters and understand them. It also gave a more humane twist to the story and made it more dramatic, when the settings and the costumes were more on the childish side.  Finally, the performances were great by everyone in the cast.  So, overall, 7 out of 10."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,The series is so good and so emotional it is itself the first series i watched in korean. Highly recommended!
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"So.... the ENTIRE premise is based on 'let's play games that we played as kids, that were based on skill and that are completely fair, and we're ALL on equal ground'.... series keeps that premise from EP01 until EP05, where it becomes not only a rigged game, but also no longer based on skill, but COMPLETELY based on luck. This is a GIANT problem because the entire premise of ""we play fair games against each other, based on skill"" is throw out the window. Honestly, the series is pretty great before that, but after that, the series is a poor 5/10. If they didn't completely throw out the premise that the series was based on, half way down the line, then this would have been a 9/10 series. I think they should make a Season2, and I just hope to God that in Season2, they don't completely derail the premise like they did in Season1, because Season1 is completely spoiled because of that."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"The concept is pretty good-how far would you go to win a life changing amount of money, especially when you have hit your lowest point? I think a good 2 hour movie would have worked just as well; start by cutting out the entire ""VIP"" nonsense. Everything else was so well scripted and designed, how did that part fail so badly? Also, I skipped the entire first 40 minutes of the first episode and lost none of the story. That tells me it was just a time filler. My only other real issue is the captions, which are pretty awful. This appears overall to be a high value production, great costumes, sets, cinematography, why skimp on something as necessary as captioning?"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,5,,"Season 1 was a great show that received a 10/10 rating from me. Although it felt a bit unusual at times (coming from someone who had no previous experience with Korean shows whatsoever), the plot was good, the character development was great, and the moral of the story was all well thought out. Scenery, lighting, acting - everything looked well, and the reason for me giving it a perfect score was the, back then, innovative story and the new ideas.  Now, after having watched season 2, I have to reduce my overall rating to 5/10, as season 2 feels exactly like what it is: Enforced. They had to come up with this sequel because Netflix wanted a sequel, not because they had more story to tell, or more ideas to put on screen.  Season 3 will be happily skipped."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,One of the best shows I have seen in a long time. Highly recommend watching it if you don't mind watching in Korean. The English dub isn't as good as the Korean version so I recommend you watch with English subtitles. Brilliant acting throughout.

In the german sync version they speak english to underline the international connection to the ""Squid game"".

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Wow, I cannot believe this show! Ending was a bit ????? But overall excellent great work Netflix."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"Season 1 The story centers on a rather original concept: Gi-hun, a man in debt and desperate, agrees to compete in a series of children's games for millions of won.  One of the series' greatest strengths is its social criticism, where the poorest barely survive while the powerful watch for entertainment. The show also makes you think about how money can bend morals and destroy everything in its path. The characters are well constructed, each with a backstory that justifies their desperation to make money. Visually, the colors are incredible vivid and colorful settings. The subplot of the undercover police officer is promising but feels incomplete and somewhat disconnected.  Season 2 The protagonist Gi-hun is no longer a participant in the games; now transformed by his experience, he is determined to confront the organization behind the game.  Among the positive aspects, the season promises to expand the universe, exploring the origins of the game, the VIPs, and the operations that support this system. This narrative ambition enriches the story. The main risk faced by this second season is the change in perspective and too much action.  Season 3  The third season leaves much to be desired, and that's where my disappointment. The ending was too rushed, and the consequences are empty, pointless plot twists that lead nowhere; it seems they've run out of ideas. The second season wraps up the plot pretty well, but it starts to fall apart at the end of the third (where you know the end is near, but nothing happens). The detective story was disappointing; it seemed quite interesting."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"I originally rated this show ten stars, no questions asked after watching season 1. I could not wait for season 2 to drop. How long did we all wait? A year? Over a year?

Now I'm only on episode 2 (barely keeping my attention) so I'm not sure if the games will begin soon and the show will start to ramp up. But either way; this is not the way to go about dropping a long awaited season 2 with this boring mess. What an utter disappointment."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"The acting in Squid Game is phenomenal. I've seen so many negative reviews based on the acting of the VIPS - in which you BARELY even see.

Acting and tragic scenes didn't had the impact it had in season 1. Sometimes annoying and it was dragged for too long. But enjoyable not that bad.  Third season was basically part 2 of season 2. The start was slow but 2nd EP was just top notch . Then, the show started moving. Again didn't felt the connection but the plot was good though it could have been way much better. VIP part was just horrible. Lastly, the ending wasn't up to the mark and could have cleared more things rather than just hinting for a spinoff. Rating - 7.5."

His plot for the series was rejected many times over the years by a lot of companies. They didn't believed in Squid Game.  What I live about Squid Game is that it deals with pain & desperation. It shows what people are willing to do to get money.  The actors were impressive during the entire season. Also recognized some familiar faces.  The plot is not predictable and never lost it magic. I was there from the first to the last second fully focused on the screen.  Squid Game & Move To Heaven are the best series on Netflix.  10/10."

The first two episodes of Season 2 had some solid moments-stunning visuals, tight editing, and a flicker of action that gave me hope. I thought the show might still pull through. But that hope was short-lived. The games themselves were boring and repetitive, and the concept behind them felt uninspired-nothing like the high-stakes, heart-pounding chaos of Season 1.  The new characters? A complete miss. The acting felt flat, and I couldn't connect with any of them. It was like they were trying to force chemistry where there was none. The pacing was another killer-the whole ""voting"" aspect dragged on for way too long, sucking out any sense of urgency or excitement. By the time the season wrapped up, I was just angry. A rushed ending with no real payoff. It felt like they just ran out of ideas and slapped something together.  Season 1 was pure magic-gripping, unpredictable, and filled with that raw tension that made us all binge-watch in one sitting. But Season 2? It's a shadow of what it once was. And with Season 3 on the horizon, I'm honestly not sure how it can redeem itself at this point. What was once a groundbreaking, thrilling show has now become a hollow echo of its former glory. Fans who once believed in the concept are now left wondering: how did it all go so wrong?  In the end, what started as a masterpiece has now descended into a series of missed opportunities. Season 2 feels like a step backward, and unless Season 3 can somehow pull off a miracle, it seems like the magic of the original has been lost. Fans are left with more questions than answers, and the excitement that once defined Squid Game has all but vanished."

I ignored it for a while, but the incessant noise could only be filtered out for so long - eventually I gave in. The faint tap of the buttons on my Google TV remote echoed through my living room, the silence almost deafening. I sat there for a while, looking at the cover - what did it all mean? I knew, of course, there was only one way to find out - I had to watch it. I had to steel myself; bend my legs, jump on the bandwagon. For a few moments I sat puzzled, wondering why I couldn't grasp the context; my brain was moving at a million miles per hour and skipped over something integral to my understanding of the media - subtitles. The echoes of the remote could be heard again as I navigated the maze of menus to provide me with context to this global phenomenon, something I had managed to avoid for as long as I could.  As I sit there, the darkness almost entirely enveloping me (save for the incredible illumination of the 55"" screen on the wall), I began to sink. I sank further and further, my sense of awareness gently escaping my grasp. 001. 199. 218. 456. The numbers revolved around me, my attention skittering between them. Who do I pine for? Who do I despise? Who do I pity? Who do I envy? Even though my mind raced through these questions, it could never find an answer. No, it could never perform any task in its entirety as it was completely and utterly hypnotized by the reel of cinema rolling before my eyes.  Eventually, I came to. I looked at my clock: 3:53 AM. How much time had passed since I sat down? I couldn't remember. I picked up my phone and a steady stream of notifications littered my lock screen. I asked myself a different question - how many DAYS had passed? I had been so engrossed in this work of art I lost all sense of being, all sense of time, all sense of life. And yet, I never felt like I missed something, like I had passed on experiences that would have made me feel some semblance of happiness and joy. My life had skipped two days in the blink of an eye and I didn't feel anything. And despite watching the illegible names of several people I knew nothing about in Hangul gently scroll up, I still continued to think about the event I had just witnessed. What happens next? At the moment, I don't know (though, my mind certainly has ideas). But I can only hope that this phenomenon continues, as my mind couldn't take the hit of knowing this would be the only exposure to something so interesting, something so vile yet gripping.  So I say to you - stop reading this convoluted memoir and watch it. You eyes may bleed; your mind may shatter - but you will never feel something as incredible as this piece of television."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"One thing I was sure of, was that the Battle Royale genre was ridden with poor scripting and substandard acting, so I never did watch any of them. And having heard Squid Game being heaped together with Battle Royals I couldn't care less about, I begun watching with low expectations. And what a horribly pleasant surprise it was! You'll get character depth and story structures you wouldn't expect from the genre. Maybe it won't live up to the hype for Battle Royal aficionados, but for the casually curious ones, you need not to worry that this will be a waste of your time. I gave 10 out of 10 as Squid Game expands the survival horror genre in general, and obviously raises the bar for the sub genre of Battle Royals."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"This is a must-watch series . It's very unique and it had me at the edge of my bed right throughout the season. The ending was not expected, but it was very interesting and I can't wait for season 2."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"The survival story is actually pretty good, but it doesn't really surprise me in a way like how a thriller should be able to suprise you. Honestly, I must admit that is too overrated since there are still tons of movies/series with better quality. To me, the story is not that tense and plot twist is also very average for a survival story.  However, what I like the most is the emotional effects that you usually find from a K-drama. As a viewer, I am able to understand the characters' backgrounds till they want to sacrifice their life for money. I mean it is very sensible since you can find it in our everydays' life. Obviously, this is a very good point since most survival stories are not that logical and sensible. Well, we can find a lot of life lessons from Squid Game. I think this is one the reasons why it is too overrated despite the average plot twists.  On top of that, I really love the 'A Class' actors as the cameos, it's quite surprising though I wish they could involve more. I think instead of the main casts, Gong Yoo is the main trigger why people are so curious to watch it. In other words, A Class cameos are the stars there. Well, I really hope they will bring back Gong Yoo and Lee Byun Hun later on!"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"It is definitely a good series in terms of action and tension in terms of the first season and the second season, but the finales could have been better in all 3 seasons, especially in the 3rd season, the character selection was terrible, there were characters behind compared to the other seasons, the ending could have been different and had a more story-like story, but overall it is definitely watchableThe last season was less action-packed than the other seasons, it was more boring and the ending was ridiculous, it was less enjoyable to watch. If the first and second seasons were 9 out of 10, this season is 5. The last episode was shot for nothing, unfortunately, but it's watchable for the first 2 seasons.

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"Hwang Dong-hyuk's ""Squid Game"" (2021-2025) delivers an absolutely gripping and profoundly impactful social thriller, immersing viewers in a brutal survival game that brilliantly critiques economic inequality and human desperation. The series excels in its relentless tension, clever game design, and the raw, compelling performances from its ensemble cast, creating a consistently captivating and often heartbreaking cinematic experience. Lee Jung-jae is phenomenal as Seong Gi-hun, embodying the everyman's struggle with remarkable authenticity, while the supporting cast adds layers of complexity and emotional depth. Its strength lies in its sharp social commentary, unpredictable twists, and an unflinching exploration of morality under extreme pressure. Instead of a mere survival show, it offers a searing, unforgettable, and endlessly rewatchable cinematic experience that resonates long after viewing.  Is it worth watching? Absolutely. ""Squid Game"" is a cinematic triumph and a must-watch for anyone who appreciates intelligent thrillers, powerful social commentary, and unparalleled storytelling. It's a truly essential series."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"This is the bravest, most intelligent show I've seen in years, absolutely blown away by the thoughtfulness in the script. There's so many layers in the script, one has to be a parent/son/bread winner/unemployed to truly appreciate the full depth of it.  The first layer it puts down is the modern slavery that's known as debt. It uses the the Korean household debt crisis as the backdrop rather than some made up excuse like a sci-fi film. This makes watching the series so much more relatable.  Another layer worth mentioning is the father saying goodbye to his daughter. The depiction was realistic and poignant, none of the overacting typically seen in a Hollywood film. I personally felt the pain for the father.  The fact that characters can act according to their free will adds another layer to the plot. Ultimately, this series is about the ugly side of human nature. Nobody forces us to do anything but when push comes to shove, it often brings out the worst of us, a side that we never knew existed.  Overall, I feel this series is deep and thought provoking. It blends real social issues with fantasy thrills without going overboard. Though we may not have survival games like these in the real world, it is still quite true that debt can make a person vulnerable. So, spare a thought for someone around you who's in financial needs and offer them some help. I think that's the message from the filmmakers."

Season 1 is all time favorite and much great when compared to season 3 and 2. The cast is perfect and done their job very well. The series is perfect for thrill lovers. I will be happy if there's another season coming. I would always like to see this type of thriller series with nice story line and acting cast. I would say this will become the most viewed netflix series and can break the netflix records."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"This series is phenomenal, cruel, big tension and a lot of sad moments.

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"Squid Game is a masterpiece of suspense and social commentary. It takes a simple premise - deadly childhood games - and turns it into a thrilling, emotional, and brutal story about survival, greed, and humanity.  The characters are well-developed, making you care about their fates even as they face impossible choices. Gi-hun and the other players are relatable, flawed, and compelling, which makes the tension even more gripping.  The series is visually striking, the pacing relentless, and the stakes feel impossibly high. Squid Game isn't just a thriller - it's a commentary on society, morality, and the human desire to survive at any cost.  It's intense, shocking, and impossible to forget - one of the best shows of recent years."

Far out plot, wonderfully unique and layered characters, and a true breakneck pacing that's sure to keep you glued. I went in rather skeptical since hype has often let me down, but I can honestly say I was dead wrong. As soon as the credits rolled on the final episode, I had half a mind to start a rewatch with the new perspective the ending grants.  Incredible."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"I have never seen a ""last man standing gets the money"" movie/series that pulled me in as much as this did. I was at the edge of my seat the entire time. (Not just because I had to read the subtitles) the raw emotion and human spirit that was shown throughout, and especially at the very end by the main character, was emotionally moving, to say the least. The mental and emotional damage shown by the players towards throughout felt so genuine. You found yourself cheering for the characters, only to be hit by the gravity of what is to happen after. They say money doesn't buy happiness, I disagree to an extent. Money would solve all of my depression right now. I have a happy marriage with a lovely wife, a beautiful son, and a decent house. However, we are so in debt due to NICU bills and other debts, and are about to lose our home. I have been thrown so low to the point of some of these characters, and I could relate to them. Would I be a part of Squid Game? Definitely not. I have too much to lose. Beautiful, yet sobering series."

To me it seems like they don't know what to do with the series after season 1. There are a lot of scenes that just doesn't make sense and is apparent that it only happen to push the plot or to make the conclusion of said part more dramatic. This series would've been an 8 but the last two seasons really threw it out for me."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,,,"The success of the movie, ""Parasite"" has given RPG film makers brain freeze. If South Korean filmmakers hate Capitalism so much, its a short trip to North Korea. Meanwhile, horrible over acting. Inconsistent internal logic. Full of plot holes. Non violent scenes are devoid of entertainment and violent scenes are repetitious and disgusting."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,2 episodes in and already hooked. It has basic concept that we have seen in other movies but Koreans know how to write unlike western writers. Characters get flushed out and you actually care about them. Acting is also really good (non of that cringy western actors). If you like well written thrillers definitely check this one out.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"The first season of Squid Game surprised the world as one of the best TV-series to be produced in the 2020s.  While the plot of Squid Game has elements that vaguely reminded me of horror classics like ""Hostel"" and ""Battle Royale"", Squid Game stood out with its gorgeous and somewhat surreal aesthetics and its use of child's play as inspiration. It also managed to balance drama, tension and humor remarkably well, making it perfect for a bingeing session.  Season 2 teased viewers several times, trying to trick us into thinking it was not just a repeat of season 1 but worse. But, really, it was mostly just that, except stretched twice as long and then cut in two.  Season 3 gave us the second part of what really should have been a single season, and by the time I reached the end, I was glad it was finally over.  It didn't help that, by the end, multiple characters kept making stupid decisions you could see coming from miles ahead, or that the VIPs still couldn't act.  It's a pity that a series that started so strong ended up to be mediocre at best. I've have given Squid Game a solid 8/10 if it had stuck to just one season. Now I can't give it more than a 6/10."

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"So no one has seen ""Empire Strikes Back"", ""Lord of the Rings"", or ""The Bourne Trilogy""? Do you guys not understand how trilogies and three-part stories are supposed to work?  We were already told that there would be three seaons total, and that BOTH seasons would be out at various times. And the director already made a public announcement far before Season 2 was released that Season 2 and 3 were a two-part narrative of the series.  The ending of Season 2 was not only designed to add more suspense and desire for Season 3, but also because it takes a long, long time to prepare two seasons of a show within a 1 year time frame.  The fact that all the vast majority of ""bad"" reviews are focused on something that was already talked about and discussed is absolutely ridiculous.  And go ahead and talk about bad writing and cheap plots all you want after you make a show better reviewed and received than this!"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"This programme will be dividing viewers opinions the works over, but in my humble one, it is outstanding.  A concept that has been done before but never with this level of death and destruction as far as I can Recall.  Some of the best drama is coming from overseas currently and we must not forget that every country has brilliant story tellers and filmmakers.  If you are watching this in English language then some of the dubbed dialogue will appear awkward and crass but overall it all comes together to make compelling viewing but a few great plot twists within.  Maybe this is a one-off series but I feel the door has been left open just enough to bring it back should someone like Netflix decide to pour in more cash. But maybe we do not need another series..."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"Squid Game as a whole starts with something truly solid-Season 1 hit hard emotionally, had layered characters, and gave you real things to think about, from economic desperation to how far people will go when pushed. But after that, it slowly falls apart. Season 2 felt like more of the same, just messier. The games were still intense, but Gi-hun's choices didn't make sense, and too many characters were thrown in with not enough depth. Then Season 3 comes along and proves they ran out of ideas. It had emotional moments, sure-but most of the writing felt lazy, rushed, or flat-out wrong. Characters you care about die in ways that don't fit their arc, and some scenes are so unrealistic or badly handled that it take you out of it. Overall, it started as something with purpose and turned into a show that kept going just because it was popular-not because it still had something real to say."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,Im still thinking about it. Its freaking genius!!!
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,The show was great until they introduced the American VIPs nonsense! Terrible dialogues and even worse acting. Just terrible terrible terrible. The show is easily an 8 or 9 but cringy VIPs nonsense make it almost unwatchable for me. Because every time the show is going great they appear ruining the whole show with stupid one-liners. There was really no need.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,3,,"Season 1: 10/10, Season 2: 5/10.  I was so excited for the second season, after so many years of waiting, and it turned out to be a disappointment. The story barely progressed at all, and the games were disappointing. I'm sure the writers made a season probably of 14 episodes and split it into two, and the problem isn't just that the story is left incomplete, but that nothing relevant happens. A terrible second season that is just a shadow of how amazing the first one was.  Regarding the first season, it's excellent, highly recommended.  However, I don't recommend watching the second season, at least not until the third one comes out, because the second is definitely an incomplete season.  Instead of making a complete story per season like good series do, they decided to split one season into two, without giving a conclusion to the first part. Big mistake.  Update: Season 3 is even worse! All the caracteres are very dumb. The policeman is the worst. And the situations are very convenient. Nothing makes sense. Lazy writing.  Splitting up the second season was a mistake. I couldn't remember who any of the characters were, nor was I interested in what happened to any of them. I lost all interest.  The first season was different, unexpected, and it wrapped up the story. It didn't really need another season; they clearly extended it for money. I recommend watching only the first season."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,When I first started Squid Game I didn't expect much. Just something to pass time at work. After the first two episodes I was hooked. The show is thrilling and makes your heart beat increase. I highly recommend watching if you are looking to have some entertainment for a couple hours.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Despite all the cringey memes and Instagram/TikTok trends that made the momentum of this show tired, the show itself is absolutely brilliant. I watched this show twice in full already, both the Korean version and the English Dub version. Both were actually really well done. I normally don't like English dubs, but they actually did a very good job with the dub for this one (minus the red light green light song and a couple of the translations). All the characters are really enjoyable and played their parts so well. When you see them in talk in interviews, you can see they difference and how well they played their parts. They're all so likeable and I hope some of them can return for season 2 somehow. Even the 'villains' are a hilarious and the sweetest people in real life, so you know how well they acted. The makeup and costumes and sets were brilliant. When you watch the behind the scenes footage on how they filmed it and the emotion they actors put into it, it's just so fascinating.  The story is both light-hearted and funny, but also very dark, deep and emotional. During and after each game, you feel the intense fear and grief that the characters are feeling and as the story progresses you feel that same uncomfortable feeling they do. The story has very deep undertones to the downfalls of how our society is and how the system takes advantage of our weaknesses and sets us up to fail.  On top of the story, the story on how the show was created was really beautiful as well. How the creator wrote those show many years ago and no one would take it or fund it, how he lost teeth from all the stress, how he had no money. It's almost like he was one of the players in the game itself.  I'm really looking forward to Season 2. I'm a bit worried though, because the creator didn't plan for a season 2 as he wasn't expecting it to be a global phenomenon, and he said he won't be writing season 2 on his own, it would be a team of people. So we'll see if they can keep the same deep quality and not ruin it."

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"Squid Game started with a bang. The first season was truly innovative, gripping, and emotionally intense. It was one of the most original concepts in recent TV history. It pulled me in immediately with its brutal honesty, clever symbolism, and high-stakes tension. However, as the show progressed, the quality steadily declined. The novelty wore off, the storytelling became less sharp, and by the end of the season, it already showed signs of faltering. The newer season unfortunately felt like a complete miss. It lacked the impact and depth that made the original so special. At this point, it really feels like they are just milking the franchise for money. I can still wholeheartedly recommend the first season, but beyond that it is hard to stay enthusiastic. Overall, I would rate the entire show a 6 out of 10. It had potential for greatness but did not manage to hold onto it."

The acting is also phenomenal, the main characters are portrayed so viscerally human and the ""game"" acts to enrich these characters while making us feel all the thrills! Its damn great stuff!  TL;DR: Incredible film making, suspense, tension, great characters and horrible VIP's  Looking forward to Season 2 (if there is one :) !!"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"I was engrossed! Very interesting story and characters UNTIL the last episode. I just could have done without the boo hoo blah blah sentimental ""here is why"" explanation.

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"The biggest feat of this show was the amazing cinematography and the atmosphere it created. From the depressing streets of urban Seoul and poor living quarters to the colorful staircases and luxurious decors of the 'game quarters', every detail in every scene creates a certain mood and fits in perfectly.  The acting was a little inconsistent, while many of the lead actors were fantastic, some of the actors that got less screentime were well below their level. But as I said they got less screentime, thus the impact stays very limited to the series as a whole.  As for the plot and its subplots, it is nothing completely new or unseen but certain elements to it make it an unique experience anyway. Even when the outcome and some of the twists were predictable they were still enjoying to watch, just because of the execution. Nonetheless the show still manages to surprise the viewer from time to time.  Overall I really enjoyed the experience despite its minor flaws, it still manages to be a extremely tense, beautiful and intriguing show. It is for that reason that I am very curious to see how (or if?) the writers will continue after the open ending of the first season."

And when did getting nervous mean my hands have to shake uncontrollably and my eyes get super wide? In season one the actors seemed much more subtle and accurate in showing their emotions. And in the final episode, while I don´t want to give out any spoilers, the shootout just seemed to drag on endlessly. Just a bit disappointed with this season."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"People have been rightly comparing this gem to the Hunger Games, and to some extent they're right; however, to oversimplify the show as another ""Dystopian Future Game Show"" drama risks looking over the masterful character work, the wildly impressive production design and cinematography, and of course the top-tier acting from everyone involved (yes, that includes the VIPs).  Everyone involved in making this, please take a bow. I look forward to where this story goes."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,After long i get master piece from korean web series bt only disspointment is vip s role.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"Squid Game  A very simple idea taken to extreme lengths. Much of the show was derivative, I can recall so many TV shows and films that had elimination by death of the contestants (Hunger Games , Logan's Run etc)leaving only one. Even the music was taken from 2001, A Space Odyssey. With that said several elements bought a brutal honesty to the narrative.  Firstly rather than merely fortune hunters the contestants were desperate (bunch of losers), so desperate they were at the last chance saloon.  The varying ages and circumstances brought a refreshing touch to a totally surreal reality this juxtaposition of tone was definitely something new.  We had some great characterisations this meant we really cared about whether they lived or died, no moment was lost in developing this area.  Following episode 1 the script writers wanted to drive home the ""losers"" back stories and how in financial extremis the possession of life and money can lay on either side of the weighing scales, inferring perhaps that a single human life does have an intrinsic monetary value. A deeply disturbing thought!  The sterile styling of the game makers brought a sinister teletubbies element combined with the island of Dr No, not to mention the Escher type staircases.  The introduction of some rather slapstick humour in episode 3 largely fell flat but the sugar game was very inventive as were the contestants solutions.  Episode 4, the opening fight sequence indicated it was a fight for survival of the fittest and for a person to rise to the top others must fall to the bottom. There were some very clever devices used to keep the narrative impetus in what was otherwise a repetitive blandness. I thought the soldiers ""side-hustle"" of selling organs was brilliantly conceived.  In episode 5 the leader explains that the players are starting again, within the game, from a position of equality, but this is a lie, as age, sex, education and experience delineate the competitors, just as it is in the ""real"" world. This was self-evident in the very next scene where women were deemed ""worthless"".  The ending was so silly, money brings the power of choice, wealthy people have no clue how much money they have, better to be unhappy rich than unhappy poor.  Obviously as an anthropological/psychological study it gave a basic review of id drivers, (mainly the instinct to survive) there was no revelatory insight here, it was just great entertainment because we must remember instinct knows no morality.  Within its genre of dystopian fiction it was a winner, it must be remember the effect of dubbing and subtitles makes art products more profound and so it was here. Overall I enjoyed it but it had a fatal flaw in that even in episode 6 contestants stated more than 1 person could win, when this is idiocy. In terms of violence I found nothing but ""manga"" comic book action, interesting but nothing shocking!  I'm giving this a 6 outta 10, meaning I enjoyed it whilst I watched it but I never want to see it again. It was refreshing in that there was absolutely no snowflake woke fashion trend elements to this relatively low budget drama, I should give it a 10 for an authentic product in an unauthentic world.  I read somewhere the writer wanted the show to highlight the disparity in class within a capitalist world, well that intention was an abject failure, it was gladiator for losers."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,5,,"The second season was okay, it was alright, not as good as the first for sure. It's supposed to be followed by the third season that will be the end, but it still feels underwhelming.

It feels like they're trying to remake the lightning bolt that was the first season, and they do not pull it off. I'll wait to watch the second part of this season anyways out of curiosity.

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"This show was incredible. Cinematography and script. -2 points because of the incredibly unlikeable, mostly pathetic main actor that is all in all acted like a terrible person to his family but not to everyone else. I didn't understand his motivation sometimes and he got quite annoying. The acting of the VIPs was a bit bizarre too."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"A pretty gripping show that has 7 solid episodes.  Sadly it has one filler episode and falls apart a bit at the end, but for the most part it's a season that you can't stop watching.  Definitely worth a watch and am recommending to my friends.  Don't think it needs a second season but I imagine one will be made."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"This is fantastic! I watched the version dubbed in English, and it felt natural, not forced. Such a cool story, each episode is exciting and good fun. People have said they don't like the VIPs acting, but I think it's appropriate for those characters to have no real depth, they're supposed to be superficial people. Have a watch for an ace fun series, I watched the lot over a couple of nights :D."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"I truly enjoyed the first two seasons , raw, emotional, and thought-provoking. But season 3 lost me. The baby scene felt completely unrealistic in a world built on brutal realism. A newborn that doesn't cry, eat, or even move? It broke the immersion and made the ending feel forced.  Still visually powerful, but emotionally disappointing."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,4,,"The first season was a fresh idea for the viewers. But the second season lacks the surprise element. It was predictable! Viewers do not get a closure like they got in the end of the first season. The second season ended on a cliffhanger! But this cliffhanger is not that good. It is filled with characters that are not at all interesting! It is just a chash crab to cash the first season. As a viewer I felt like the should have ended in the first season. Tje revenge turn the second season takes is very weak and not at all interesting! If the first season is an 8 then it gets only half, a four out of ten stars."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"..but entertained from the very beginning until end of season 1.  Interesting story, great act (except of the crazy woman and the VIP's - really annoying) However I've enjoyed each episode!"

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Great sequel. I think the people who were disappointed were only looking solely for ""superficial shock value"". Squid Game 2 has more of a human drama element. It goes deeper into that game world and explores the themes of human psychology and human nature. Still, there was plenty of suspense and excitement- although somewhat predictable, it was sprinkled with nice twists and you become emotionally invested, rooting for some characters and laughing/crying when they did. I loved how the story has developed in quite a meaningful way, going beyond the superficial. However, if you just want a joy ride, this may not be for you. The sequel requires a bit more of deep philosophical thinking to appreciate it."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,Warning do not watch the trailers do not read the reviews Just watch don't spoil it for yourself It is a must watch series In the beginning it was slow but as everything kicked off and started omg I was on the Edge of my seat non stop binge watched it all I had work the next morning at 2am I couldn't stop watching I had no sleep.  So must effort put into making it!
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"This show is a very entertaining but there were some things that left me very disappointed. In season one it was very fun and suspenseful to watch and the plot twist were good. The cast throughout the whole show was amazing at acting and extremely attractive. In season 2 I felt like it was too similar to season one. Yes the games were different but it wasn't like extremely different nor was it as good as season 1. I watched this show in 2024 so, not that long before season 2 came out and I feel like it was way too repetitive. The emotional effect in this show wasn't that great. Like the fact that when some characters died I wasn't that upset. It's very much a slow burn in season 2 but if you do want a suspenseful show I would highly recommend you watch it."

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,To begin I have to say that it is not that I don't like the series . I have to say it is a story with good plot and well acted but there's some thing that don't come to an end at season 1 and never to be explained in season 2 .  I believe that the main character was trying hard to be shown evil without letting the others be close to him for no reason . Also the season 2 was far more worse than season 1 cause of the repetition that took place in the games and at the main room with the fighting and the killing between the two formed alliances . Overall it is worth spending time but not to have as a best of all time series to watch .
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,5,,"I truly didn't believe that episode 7 in Season 2 was the finale. The most action we got out of the entire season and it was the last episode. This whole season was a cash grab. The director said it himself, he only did Season 2 because he didn't make much money from the first one. Between the Dominoes, Doritos, and Puma collaborations with this series, I can't take it seriously anymore. Like others have stated, Season 1 was phenomenal and should have been left at a limited series. Season 2 is extremely drawn out to make unnecessary back stories for people who end up dying in the very next game they play."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"UPDATE:  There once Was a time where streaming platforms were competing and focused first and foremost on the quality creating ""original"" series content. The goldenage of bingewatching. I haven't experienced a series as addicting and all consuming as this series since 'Dark'.  It's been three years since Netflix biggest shows debut. It's no wonder considering how meticulous the writing is. This series isn't simply just a show. It's an experience that tip toes the lines between insanity and genuis resulting in pure brilliance.  The emotional depth to each character is told beautifully but the acting is absolutely phenomenal. Each episode is its own movie always delivering arcs delivering a white knuckle ride. I miss these days of being devoured by a series unwilling to NOT hit 'NEXT EPISODE'. The style this world is shown through the lens is completely unique and original that bleeds inspiration. The lead had an even more challenging job to perform this season and showed great depth and range. I sincerly hope this series numbers helps encourage more brilliant tv to be created. BRAVO  No wonder this series took so long to create and it shows because there's literally not one flaw. It's perfect in every sense and has every major ingredient that makes it one of the best shows of this decade hands down!  The acting; absolutely incredible. The leads acting is stunning and beautiful even without him saying anything his facial expressions speaks volumes in VERY dramatic scenes (which scenes aren't?)  The directing is stellar and flawless. I love shows that are truly unique; Severance, Night Sky just to make a couple.  My favorite series just to give my opinion of this series context; Mr. Robot, The leftovers, Fargo, Dark, Altered Carbon S1, Westworld s1, Legion, Severance, Night Sky, Utopia UK, Black Mirror too many to list but if you like a few of said shows you will love this 100%.  You get attached to most of the characters and note: watch this with subtitles for the full experience as intended.  This is probably the most addicting bingable show 11 out of 10 easy.  You'll thank me give it a shot."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"A group of desperate people agree to play high-stakes children's games, and then find how high the stakes really are. The show is an odd mix of nonsense and excellence. The premise is interesting but the ultimate revelation about the games and their founder is simplistic and does little explain the provenance of the vast, complex yet secret game venue. There are some hints at secondary plotlines but they go nowhere and the introduction of wealthy gamblers is a heavy-handed social-commentary that adds nothing to the story (and leads to the weakest moments in the series). The acting and characters are excellent and the dark shifts in their motives and ethics as more and more players are 'eliminated' is expertly done (episode 6, ""Gganbu"" is a highlight). The imagery, especially the creepy geometric enforcers, the 'play grounds' and the multicolored stairs that look like something from an Escher etching is memorable (and may be what really sets 'Squid Game' apart from similar 'deadly games' series). The film is quite violent, both in a cartoony way and in a more visceral 'realistic' and disturbing way. Not to everyone's' taste but entertaining and compelling."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"Being slapped with an open ending after 4 years, 3 seasons and 22 episodes was quite disappointing. The casting was really great. There were scenes that made me question humanity and there were also scenes that made me believe in the same. Too many subplots made it hard to focus on one thing and due to only 6 eps being in season 3, many of sub-plots were left half baked. The amount of adrenaline rush i got throughout this entire series is insane. It made me feel grateful for the little things i have in my life. The consistent character throughout the entire series- Seong Gi Hun did a fantastic job with his phenomenal acting and consistent character development. It was very sad to see few character deaths. Worth watching once for the adrenaline rush. Thank you for reading this i hope you have a great day!"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"Squid Game Season 1 is a masterpiece that stands on its own. The show's creator, Hwang Dong-hyuk, crafted a compelling narrative that explores themes of survival, class struggle, and human nature. The characters are well-developed, and the plot is engaging, making it a must-watch.  While Netflix has released two more seasons, they don't quite live up to the standard set by the first season. Instead of feeling like a natural progression of the story, the subsequent seasons seem like an attempt to cash in on the franchise's popularity.  If you're looking for a self-contained story with a clear beginning, middle, and end, Season 1 of Squid Game is the way to go. The finale provides closure, and the story doesn't feel incomplete or open-ended.  By watching only Season 1 and pretending the other seasons don't exist, you'll avoid the disappointment that some fans have expressed with the later seasons. You'll also get to experience the show as a cohesive, well-crafted narrative that doesn't feel like it's dragging on or trying to artificially prolong the story.  In short, Squid Game Season 1 is a phenomenal achievement that can be enjoyed on its own terms. If you're new to the series, start with Season 1 and appreciate it as a standalone work of fiction."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,4,,"This show was like a mixtape of other (and better) shows. You can virtually see the Netflix algorithm in action: ""The capitalism parable in Parasite won an Oscar, so let's go with that. And people responded really well to the colorful uniforms and weird masks in Casa de Papel, so let's give people a chance to dress up as our characters on Halloween which will give the show free PR. Oh, and Battle Royale was really successful and influential, so let's pretty much steal that whole concept right down to the classical music and cheery female speaker!""  The VIPs get a lot of flak for their acting in many reviews on IMDb, and rightly so. But let's be honest, the Korean actors are no better. This show is filled to the brim with bad Asian style overacting, something which is far too common in Korean and Japanese shows. The bad guy with the face tattoo is right out of some school play, and the guy in the lead is pulling faces like a madman. I have no idea who they are but I wouldn't be surprised if they originally are comedians. The best actor in the whole show is the main character's daughter and she's only in it for a couple of minutes.  As per usual for a Netflix production the story is stretched very thin in order to make it nine hours (!) long."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"I found it amazing through and through. Very emotional, I felt horrible during every episode but I kept watching and found the suspense amazing. Well done."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"It's pretty unreal how shallow-minded many of the reviewers are here. They are griping about the acting. It's nothing short of brilliant, and very much representative of the Korean style. If those people watched Old Boy or Parasite, they would immediately realize the strength and potency of it, and how it plays well into the dimensions of the characters and the plot threads that surround them.  The sudden outbursts and taciturn restraint from the main and side characters are a mixture of subtlety and overreaching. It's a delightful balance here. It's also refreshing to see this instead of the atrociously mundane acting, like say in Clickbait where the actors are overly restrained so they can look attractive for the camera.  This series is immensely intriguing. Listen closely for the nuances of emotion even behind the masks. Kudos to the producers and writers for being bold and for - after ten years - getting this series put onto the small screen for us to relish in with giddy delight thanks to their tenacity with Netflix."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"As a longtime fan of the Squid Game universe, I must say - Season 1 was lightning in a bottle. It came with a unique story, raw emotions, and unpredictable twists that made it one of the finest Korean series of the decade.  In contrast, the second season stretched each episode unnecessarily. It felt like the pacing was off - dragging certain scenes that could've been more impactful with tighter editing. It lacked the tension and urgency that made the first season so memorable.  However, Season 3 brought back some of the spark. The games were far more engaging this time around. Especially Episode 4 - titled ""222"" - stood out brilliantly. The game concept was clever, and the actor it focused on delivered a great performance. Easily one of the best episodes in the latter seasons.  Among the characters, the ones who stayed with me emotionally were the main protagonist, the mother-son duo, and the girl - their arcs still held weight and pulled at the heartstrings.  That said, the one-hour runtime per episode wasn't always justified. Some subplots and filler scenes felt unnecessary, possibly added just to stretch the watch time. The Superstition scenes were particularly pointless and could've been edited out without affecting the plot.  And the ending... it didn't really satisfy me. Not bad, but it missed the emotional punch it was building up to. For a show that started with such promise, it deserved a more impactful farewell.  Today marks the end of one of my favorite Korean series. I'll remember it, no doubt - but I'll also wish it ended stronger.  We are not horses, we are humans...humans are...  My Rating: 7 out of 10."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,I just loved it! You can easy watch it during all weekend non stop! It's so much different from other series available. Completely different genre.  Recommended to everyone.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"Damp squib or Damp squid, how did season two go or not go down?  Season two-cut short-mystery removed Lacks the creativity of the ground breaking first season.  The first episode was a filler Pre-Sequel story and build up. It dragged on quite a bit. Then when he finally makes it back to the island.  What I wanted as view was a knock out10 episodes, ten new challenges and all we got was lack lustier 3-4 challenges and same red light green light challenge and this time was not as good.  I thought best challenges were tug of war and cookie cutter.  This ended up in gun fight without conclusion and left waiting for another year.  I suppose the thrill of watching the challenges is no longer the main story.  It is now about exposing who is behind it this year or next. The old man in first season was part of it and thought he started challenges.  Are we the viewer, as interested in that as watching challenges is the question."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,3,,"This is the proof people are still fans of predictable stories. If this is the 2021 most mainstream TV series, something is definitely off. Except for a few moments and interesting parts when they participate in the game, everything else is filled with already seen stuff. Main character's morality is selectable/clashing in different situations, ridiculous plot twists and most of all, acting and dialogue of ""rich people watching"" is major cringe. I would avoid this, except if you really want to see why is this so popular."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,Wow! Amazing show worth watching for sure. Concept was so good. The VIPs doe.. their acting was weird. Other than that the whole show keeps you on the edge.. the characters were really well played and I can't wait for the next season.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"Squid Game isn't just a show about survival but a striking display of human morality, social class and capitalism. It combines thrilling action with hard hitting emotional moments creating a show unlike any other.  S1 is still the best season by far. It introduced the characters, the conflict and established the world. It explored each character with raw emotional depth and the incorporated their subplots brilliantly into the narrative. You feel for each character and their struggles. And the performances were fantastic particularly by Lee Jung-jae as the protagonist Gi-hun, Park Hae-soo as Sang-woo, Jung Ho-yeon as Sae-byeok and Anupam Tripathi as Ali Abdul. It's almost perfect, if you cut out the VIP's. Boy they were cringe to watch.  S2 was decent with an emphasis of exploration of the system. There are a lot of new characters introduced which are instantly likeable and fun. The biggest standout amongst the new characters was easily Thanos. The new games are quite thrilling to watch. This season delves into a more mystery elements of the games and some key characters. And ofcourse the performances are great particularly by Lee Jung Jae as Gi-hun, Park Sung-hoon as Hyun-ju, Choi Seung-hyun as Thanos, Lee Byung-hun as The Frontman and Gong Yoo as the salesman. That said, it suffers from pacing issues and some subplots that didn't make much sense. And that cliffhanger ending didn't do it much of a justice.  S3, however, was a low bar, though not bad at all. It picks up right after the ending of S2, exploring more of the characters introduced in the previous season. This season leans much more deeper into the themes of human morality and trauma and while the performances from the ensemble cast are stellar as ever and it delivers on the action and the games, it does have its fair share of issues. A lot of the writing and subplots are questionable or didn't make any sense. Gi-Hun is essentially overshadowed for the first few episodes in favour of other less interesting characters. And the ending is quite ambiguous. Oh yeah, and the VIP's are back and so is the cringe factor.  Overall, Squid Game is an exhilarating and brutal depiction of human morality, trauma, social class and capitalism with surprising emotional depth. While some the writing and subplots don't always make a whole lot of sense and the VIP's are one of the worst aspects of the show, it's fantastic performances from the ensemble cast, brutal action, layered characters and honest depiction of its themes makes it a thrilling watch."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"I'm sure by this time most of you have seen this series and I'm glad to have watched it as well the minute it came out in Netflix. For those who haven't, there are a lot of memes and clips showcased in FB and Tiktok..and in all honesty watching this is an absolute treat.  We are all aware by now how Koreans can leave us in awe when it comes to the series or movies that they create. And Squid Game is an interesting and unique concept, something that left me fascinated until the end. Some may think that it is just a series with gruesome games involved, but frankly that is the part which makes it exciting like hell.  Short but sweet as it only contained 9 episodes, and although the ending will keep us curious and wanting for more, it's enough for me to understand the plot and message it meant to deliver.  Would you want a Season 2? I know I would."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,,,"Absolute masterpiece and a must watch. It has excellent premise, gripping & binge-worthy development, perfectly handle twist & turns, fantastic character arcs and overall exceptional writing and acting!  It's near the realm of perfection with little to complain but if I have to nitpick, my only minor gripes are: 1. Motivation revealed in last episode could have been more...philosophical (maybe it's lost in translation) 2. VIPs acting are really bad, like...they supposed to be world's richest a-holes, not jerk high schooler reading off a drama script..."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"The three things that I look for when watching something are storytelling, performance, and attention to detail. Squid game passes all of those with flying colors. The storytelling and atmosphere is incredible, well thought-out, and keeps you invested from start to finish. Going into this, I thought that a show about deadly children's games would get cheesy at points, but boy was I wrong. This show digs deep into the psyche of the characters and delivers some very powerful and emotional scenes, which the actors absolutely nail. There isn't much to say about the acting other than each of these actors (with the exception of the VIP's that spoke English) deliver phenomenal performances that take you on an emotional Rollercoaster. Lastly, I'm the type of person that will pause shows to spot inconsistencies or plot holes as they are very telling for how seriously the creators took the show/movie. I can tell how invested everyone that worked on this was because I didn't catch a single inconsistency. It seemed like every single detail was thought out and carefully crafted.  This show is brutal, bleak, and doesn't sugar coat anything or deliver any corny cliche's. It feels authentic from start to finish. Definitely not a feel good show or for the faint of heart, but would absolutely recommend giving this a watch."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"Most of the characters are very well written, sadly I can't say the same about the story. A lot of plotholes, and just overall sruff that didn't make sense. But apart from that, most aspects are pretty much fine. So all in all, an above average series but certainly not great or anything.  7/10: good but not great."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"The plot is super interesting! It offers you almost identical storyline to the one of Alice in borderland, but it's even better. The characters are all round, none of them are flat. The gore is great and it does leave you on the brink of being creeped out by the events it creates. Love every bit of it. Moreover, the plot twist at the end is really well done, if you keep your eyes peeled at every little detail, you can figure it out yourself, but it's not really all that simple.  Really recommend it to everyone. Very interesting and can't wait for season 2."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"I mean, I'd say I liked The Hunger Games better - but not The Maze Runner. There's a real grimness to The Squid Games. Like The Platform. With every episode you're ground down deeper just like these poor saps who find themselves there. I liked it well enough though it was long and the characters pretty familiar to this genre. It does makes many apt comments about contemporary society - Ali's story is particularly sad as is Sae- Byeok's and the way we treat people just seeking a better life. I can't say I get the uproar of the series - Netflix's potential biggest- but it's worth a watch if you like dystopian stuff - and who doesn't?"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"I now watched season two and I liked it, but the paradox is that its main fans base from the season one will, probably, not. Unfortunately, modern viewers tastes are defined by simpleton storylines like Marvel comics with a punch of brutality and violence for the sake of shocking value. Season 1 became a phenomenon because of its simple story premise and lots of shocking value. Season 2 got bigger budget, hence more thought and talent was poured in, but ironically it will be their downfall. The crowd will want more blood and games, while season 2 got more character development and dialogue. Anyway, I enjoyed first two episodes a lot, the middle had ups and downs, but knowing a villain from the beginning is a nice touch and balancing his views versus ""hero"" virtue signalling was good as well. I wish the ending was more satisfying and the special soldiers storyline on boats was more believable and less caricature, but, hey it's still a Korean drama."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"Excellent showcase of human mind and emotions. Its the battle of strong people against the weak people covering all aspects such as morality ,honesty,sacrifice,smartness,cunningness and so on.  This series is definitely worth your time and will hook you up to watch the season at a single stretch."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"I waited until I watched Season 2 before leaving a review. The pace hasn't changed one bit from Season 1. The tone is much darker right off the bat compare to Season 1 but balances it out later when new characters in the game come into play.  As far as new characters go, I love the interaction between the mom and the son. Director knows how to pull my heart string... I was praying that they would both survive every single game they played. However, my favorite has to be Thanos the purple haired, drug-addict rapper. That's all I'll say about him since I don't want to spoil.  Main new mechanic that they included this time is the ""X"" and ""O"" patches that each player is given matching the choice of their vote in continuing the game. This creates even more tension in the series among the players that we have not seen in Season 1.  The games are again basic childhood games many Koreans have played growing up.  Violence level is still up there and they do not hold back whatsoever. So if you were squeamish watching Season 1, you'll probably be squeamish watching Season 2.  JUST GO WATCH IT.  Side note - My fav episodes for S02 (not in any order) E1, E3, E6, E7."

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"The show started off strong, with compelling characters and an engaging storyline that really hooked me. It was clear the writers had a solid grasp on balancing narrative, character development, and deeper themes in a way that felt natural and entertaining. However, starting in Season 2, it felt like the focus shifted away from storytelling and more toward pushing specific social messages, particularly around trans rights.  While I appreciate the importance of representation and social issues, the way it was handled came across as heavy-handed and more like a lecture than an organic part of the story. Instead of weaving these themes into the narrative in a nuanced way, it felt like the writers were prioritizing virtue signaling over delivering the engaging plot that initially made the show so good.  As a result, the pacing suffered, character arcs felt forced, and the show lost some of the charm that made it so enjoyable in the first place. It's disappointing because there was so much potential to explore these topics without sacrificing the integrity of the story. For me, it became harder to stay invested as the focus shifted away from what drew me to the show in the first place."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"I would rate the third season as the most well-crafted and engaging one so far. The storyline is captivating and well-paced, with complex and realistic characters that make the plot even more immersive. The atmosphere is dark and intense, perfectly supported by impressive cinematography and a strong musical score that adds depth to every scene. Although the brutality was sometimes quite extreme, it fit well with the overall tone of the series and helped emphasize its raw and emotional nature. Overall, I really enjoyed this season - it was powerful, visually stunning, and emotionally gripping from start to finish. I'm definitely looking forward to the next season and can't wait to see how the story continues."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,5,,"This is a gripping, bingeable series. Without a doubt. It is fast-paced and builds anticipation throughout.  But once the mystery fades, we see a pretty shallow set-up. Promising character development ultimately does not hold up, with some making seemingly inexplicable (but plot advancing) decisions. Other supporting characters have absolutely no-depth at all to the point of being gratingly inhuman. Other reviewers compare it to anime/cartoon. I agree.  In the end, there are enough open questions to support a second season but unfortunately not enough resolution in the first season to feel we really got the payoff we needed for putting up with all that violence."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"If you haven't seen Korean movies or shows before hand, you will blown away from this show. Squid Games is well crafted to be enjoyable to what show about human demons and family. The end was predictable (as I have seen other Korean films and shows), something won't be right, there is no happy end at no cost. This was good show compared to any poor attempt to create anything original (*cough cough American shows ). I hope this cultural exchange will help the viewers to see other types of screen play and to learn to distinguish the good from the absolute trash."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"Squid Game is a gripping series that exposes the cruelty of economic inequality through deadly games where desperate people compete for survival and wealth. The early episodes are intense and original, with strong social commentary, but as the story progresses, it becomes increasingly artificial and less impactful. Despite this decline, it remains a powerful critique of modern society's obsession with money. I would give it 84/100."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"I loved Squid Game from the first episode. It was difficult to watch and many scenes were absolutely brutal. The mind games that were played in the show were intense, and you really began to feel for the characters. This is the first Korean based drama that I have ever watched and it brings me to wonder if there is more out there for me.  Unfortunately the last season (season 3) was a weak and the final episode was extremely disappointing to watch in my opinion. I understand the they had a lot of things to tie up, but it just didn't seem to have the ""umph"" of a final episode of such a popular show. I feel they could've done better but we will never know."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,Not gonna lie it did take me awhile to watch this show. But I gotta say. It was great. I actually really enjoyed it. I surprisingly liked a lot of the characters.

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"Promising storyline, interesting plot points, with a realistic cultural context aswell as the social dispute.

We all know the answer but it's still deeply disturbing and saddening.  Well, they tried to give us hope and even though there's no reason to, I'm not ready to give up on that...yet.  The fact that I cried for that old guy; what more can I say?!  FUN?! WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN???  I remembered smth from ""Crash"" which fits perfectly here  ""It's the sense of touch. (...) We're always behind this metal and glass. I think we miss that touch so much that we crash into each other just so we can feel something.""  And there's that about social classes, hierarchy, capitalism, religion, nature vs. Nurture, immigration, suicide, love, blah-blah  The show is brilliant!"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"The plot makes almost zero logical sense, but the show itself was still enjoyable, even in a comical way. The characters are shallow and lack any realistic motivations, so it's hard to feel anything for the story. I thought it looked pretty nice though, and in general the pacing was decent."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,5,,"Season 1: 8/10 Season 2: 5/10 Season 3: 5/10  Season 1 of Squid Game was solid, riveting and thrilling television. It was a shocking take on real injustices and social inequality and held no punches in showing it. Furthermore, there was clearly no reservations on the gratuitous exploitation of the ""players"", it was jarring, gritty and horror-esque. Beneath this, was a concrete story with interesting characters and motivations, diverse yet relatable.  Season 2 of Squid Game ignores everything from the above, and goes in the absolute opposite direction. The writing is poor, the characters are uninteresting and bland, the creative direction has clearly shifted to be more ""family friendly"", and yet this is Squid Game we're talking about, the horror-esque elements have all been toned down dramatically. That thrill factor is gone. The reason for all these changes stems from Netflix's drive for marketability of the Squid Game name, you can't promote Squid Game merchandise in video games if Squid Game is too violent... And yet Season 2 still had a few graphic scenes but not nearly as insane as Season 1's depictions, Season 2's graphic depictions borders on medical and general violence, things you'd see in video games.  Overall, everything that made Squid Game unique and interesting has been erased in Season 2, almost as though Season 1's world building was retconned in order to preserve marketability of the brand name."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,Amazing story and action and it holds up to everything i've heard. Suspenseful and allegorical but not too gory or horrific. It leaves it open enough to a second season and i would absolutely watch that.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"""Squid Game"" is a series that, in a brutally honest way, lays bare human greed, despair, and the will to survive. Behind the bloody games lies an allegory of modern society, where a person becomes a pawn when debts, poverty, and inequality take over their life. The characters are complex and difficult to reduce to black-and-white categories, precisely because each of them carries their own reasons and their own demons. What lingers after watching is not just the shock of violence and tragedy, but the bitter realization that today's world can be recognized in that story. The series is a rare blend of tension, emotion, and social critique that is seldom seen on television."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"Ok, I have to get this off my chest. It really annoys me when people just don't give a realistic review of movies and tv shows because giving something 10 and saying 'best thing ever!' or a 1 (or even 0) and saying 'worst thing ever!' serve no purpose except to feel the gap some people have in their life for a hobby... I find it especially annoying when people rate something zero and say 'I was bored after 10 minutes so turned off' - hey buddy, don't review it then if you're not mature enough to invest some time! Go watch some Tik Tok videos instead!  Ok, rant over lol.  I put this on for the sake of having something in the background while I worked from home. It was a huge mistake as I kept concentrating on the show with work in the background! Sorry boss :) I did however change it to other ""stuff"" when I realised it was a show I wanted to watch.  The basic premise is simple - people with huge debts and nothing really to live for are offered a part in 6 games and the winner gets huge amounts of money. Simples. What they don't know is that they might die...  I don't know how they do it, but Korea just nails it when it comes to creating characters that are fallible but likeable. They even make bad guys, real a-holes, somehow relatable and fleshed out so they're not just one dimensional villains.  Anyway, I won't spoil anything for anyone except to say it's really very good :) It doesn't glorify the deaths, they're grim and matter of fact and as the series progresses, because they've developed characters and you've invested in them then their deaths hit pretty hard :( I sort of assumed that more would survive but this feels like it's completely self contained like they didn't expect a second series.  Watch it, enjoy it - or not - just don't come in and review it like a child afterwards."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"After the big fights in season 2, Seong Gi-hun (number 456) suffers from posttraumatic stress disorder. Now he is brooding and staring all the time. Other characters drive the plot forward. Their motivations will remain vague. There is a lot going on in season 3, a great built-up towards a spectacular finale - that never happens. So in the end it's all basically pointless.  Something is very wrong, when people actually love the Squid Games. On a technical level it's very competently made, for the most part. But the story told is repulsive, at least it should be. And it doesn't criticise ""capitalism"", it shows how low greedy and malevolent humans can sink.  The message of season 2 was: The elite isn't evil, the commons are trash. That's the word members of the squid organisation use a lot when they talk about the participants of their games. This contempt is underpinned by the new rule that the survivors have to vote after every game, if they are satisfied with the money they've already won or want to continue. What kind of creatures vote repeatedly for murder? The lowest of the low. Season 3 really hammers this message home. When the majority votes for murder/suicide, the minority will also die. During the last game, ""democracy"" becomes a dirty word. The title of this episode is ""Humans Are..."". Disposable? Disposable. They throw themselves away!  Squid Game"" isn't just another funny death cult TV show, but merciless, desperate criticism of a society that has lost its moral compass and where neither following the shiny road to promised happiness, nor stupid heroism, like 456's, or just voting harder will save the day. Ultimately, this is not supposed to entertain - and the last episode surely doesn't -, but a call for repentance. Don't be like the disgusting participants in the Squid Games, stop playing children! You can do better than that!"

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"Squid Game isn't just a television series; it's a haunting reflection of real life. It shines a brutal light on the power of money - both as a friend and an enemy of mankind. At its core, this is a story about debt, desperation, and the painful decisions people make when they feel they have no other choice. Many walked blindly into terror, manipulated by their need for survival, unaware of the emotional and physical cost.  What makes Squid Game truly unforgettable is how deeply relatable it is. It's packed with raw emotions - happiness, horror, fear, suspense, shock - all portrayed with stunning realism. The cast didn't just act, they lived their roles. Their performances felt so authentic that it was easy to forget you were watching fiction.  The production quality is top-tier - from the sets to the cinematography to the eerie soundtrack. Every detail was executed with precision. It's no surprise that Squid Game is one of the most-watched series globally - it genuinely earns that status.  I was left speechless, and I absolutely can't wait for Season 3."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"This show isn't as amazing as everyone is making it out to be. It's definitely entertaining to watch, but it doesn't have any more substance to it than that. Maybe because I've watched this after the ""raging hype"", but I personally don't think this is a new concept at all.  The acting is decent and it's filmed well, but my rating went down from 7 to 6, due to the explanation we're given as to why the games exist in the first place.  Perhaps a lot of the viewers haven't seen Battle Royal and generation Z have only just discovered violent asian cinema."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"What I loved most about this show is the acting was fantastic (with the exception of the white VIPs - they were terrible actors - perhaps on purpose), the backstories were believable and heart wrenching, and the suspense was very real. This wasn't violence for the sake of violence. I found myself rooting for certain characters and I was invested in the storytelling. The ending also didn't disappoint. One of the best Netflix shows I've seen. Very much looking forward to season 2. Also, viewing tip: don't watch with English voices dubbed over. Do the subtitles. It feels more real and genuine. You really get a sense of emotion in the voices."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"*Roughly Translated From Brazilian Portuguese.  Series Review - Squid Game (Season 1).  I confess that I went to watch this series thinking it would not be good. As much as she has been voted the most viewed in the world recently, I was too suspicious of her potential, thinking that it could be a shallow plot, just a ""popocão"" to marathon. I was wrong.  The show is very balanced, it has a plot, it has good characters, and it grips you in a very smooth way, where you're tempted to keep watching, episode after episode.  Overall, it's guaranteed fun. The show's aesthetic alone tells us not to take it too seriously, so don't. Skip the details and have fun.  Out of respect for the great old series, which were extremely well done, I won't give it a higher rating, but it's a very good series.  Good for a marathon on a Saturday after lunch, alone or with others.  Rating: 4/5 - Very good series."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,2,,"First season is quite nice. The show drags you in, keeps being interesting, and you quickly wants to see what's going to happen. So you binge watch the show. And at the end of the season, the story kind of ends. So a good closure of the season. There is room left for a 2nd season, but if you don't see the 2nd season, no issue.  2nd season though is just to milk the success of the 1st. Half way through the story, stops the season. Just to milk the success of the 1st season a year longer. Like you're in a restaurant and half way through your steak the waiter comes and takes it away ""come back next year to finish it"""

Set in South Korea in the present day, this series is a stark look at what people will do when society has failed them - richly character driven and with a wonderfully original take on the sinister, this is a Netflix series that has depth, drama, entertainment and shock-value.  It's a not afraid to be a slow burner at times, but the mystery and slight surrealist nature of 'The Game' drives your attention throughout.  It's worth watching and taking time over. Really recommended."

It is hella dark, hella bleak, and once you start it, you won't be able to stop until you know who wins the game. I need Season 2, please.  This is NOT Alice in Borderland!!!

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"Squid Games - Let the Games Begin! This was an extreme bazaar competition amongst willing participants in a progression of children's games where all they have to do is follow the rules to win a huge cash prize. However, they did not know what they were getting into when they signed up and did not know what the meaning of ""elimination"" meant. The episodes are extremely frightening and violent and not meant for anyone other than adults if even that. One criticism I have is the title of the series because it may entice teens to watch it - they might want to see what kind of game this is, and it is clearly not for the unattended child or teen. There was something off about the VIPs - I am not sure if they were supposed to be Americans but if so, they weren't portrayed right as the English isn't the way an American would speak or it is dubbed funny or just something off. I knew there was something more to some of the characters which will be divulged at the ending of the series. The last person standing gets a make-over and looks ridiculous with that bright red hair and if they get on that plane to LA they will be laughed at and called Bozo. I think a more attractive look could have been selected. Only 9 episodes makes this a short series, however Netflix just announced Season 2 so there will be more to come."

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,This was an interesting program but not as great as reviewers are making it sound. This show is about a bunch of deadbeat gamblers who are offered an opportunity to play a game where they either win a lot of money or die a violent death. Only deadbeat gamblers would take the option to play the game knowing only one person will ultimately survive to win the cash. Basically the plot shows how morally bankrupt the world has become and to me that is just sad. It isn't exciting and fun to watch hundreds of people die a bloody death. The fact that so many people found this show to be great is really sad too.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,As we enter I don't know the 10th lockdown in my country thanks to the coronavirus and its variants dropping sequels and prequels every so often I finally decided to check it out and see what the hype is about.  Literally finished the show start to finish ! Edge of the seat type of show.  The plot itself is simple but the direction the screenplay and the casting ..mind blowing !
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"Humans vs humans is a no brainer for writers. Be it Hunger Games, 13, The Hunt, or Surviving the Game, I as well as others, for what ever reason, are going to watch...in spite of the quality.  My first concern was the acting, not the actors ability, but them acting like Koreans. Are Koreans usually this giddy and overly reactive in certain situations? The main character at the horserace or with his daughter was uncomfortable to watch, but it could be it didnt translate well. As for the VIP, a lot of criticism has been on their acting, but does it matter since the Korean version would have translated there words for them? If so, they could have been spouting gibberish and the subtitles for the Korean audience would have remedied that easily.  As with the aforementioned films, this one lacks a punch ending. Writers just dont seem to find a ending that is as strong as the beginning. The last game had none of the emotional power and cleverness of the prior ones. The 5th left something to be desired also, except to resolve an issue between two characters.  I suffered through all of my criticisms, and you should as well. It is just such a strong idea, wish someone could deliver an ending."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"A new addition to the ""battle royale"" genre, Squid Game adds a refreshing take.  The situations in which the characters find themselves is heart-rending drama. I've seen some reviews claim that the show attempts to legitimize the shock value violence by hiding behind a poor veil of human interest/sociology 101, but I honestly find the show gripping, and I finished with genuine interest in the characters portrayed.  Be forewarned - it is violent and at times difficult to watch, but if you can get past that, you'll find a gem."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"I feel like the show's overrated. There were too many holes in the story IMO. First of all, does the battery on that officer's phone ever run out? Secondly, how do people go missing (and not just one, but more than 400 each time) and nobody finds out anything? And they have been running the games for years now, so, it is pretty unrealistic. In addition, don't people get flagged for having all that money suddenly in their bank accounts? However, the overall idea of show was something new and exciting. It is worth watching, but there are far better shows out there."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"A South Korean survival drama series titled ""Squid Game"" was produced by Hwang Dong-hyuk and made available on Netflix in 2021.  The show gained significant popularity both domestically and internationally, attracting a large audience and generating a lot of discussion.  The series follows a group of financially struggling individuals who participate in a mysterious survival game where they compete in childhood games for a chance to win a substantial cash prize. However, the game takes a dark turn as contestants face life-threatening consequences and the true nature of the competition is revealed.  ""Squid Game"" received positive reviews from both critics and viewers for its unique concept, suspenseful storytelling, and social commentary. Many praised the series for its exploration of socio-economic issues, such as income inequality and desperation driving people to extreme measures. The show also delves into the themes of human nature, morality, and the consequences of our choices.  The performances of the cast, including Lee Jung-jae and Park Hae-soo, were widely acclaimed for their compelling portrayals of the characters and their emotional depth. The production quality, set design, and visual effects were also highly praised.  Critics have noted that the series can be intense, violent, and emotionally challenging, as it doesn't shy away from depicting the harsh realities faced by the characters. However, the series' strong character development and thought-provoking narrative have been cited as reasons for its widespread appeal.  Overall, ""Squid Game"" has been well-received and has gained a dedicated fan base. It has been lauded for its intriguing premise, storytelling, and social commentary, making it one of the most talked-about series of 2021."

By now people should be over this kind of thing, but it makes them feel smart, and they can parrot phrases they heard from other people like ""it's an study of human nature"" etc etc. The positives for it are the aesthetic of the sets and costumes. This world and it's environment just make you want to jump into the screen and explore, though not if it means being a part of the games. I enjoyed it well enough but let's face it, this is no 8.0+ IMDB ratings are a joke."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,5,,"The first season was brilliant - a fresh, gripping concept that was executed masterfully. It drew me in from the very first episode and left a lasting impression. Despite some initial skepticism, the second season was also very enjoyable and managed to keep the tension and originality alive. However, once again, we had to wait an incredibly long time for the next season, and unfortunately, the final one turned out to be a complete disaster. Poor writing, weak character development, and none of the emotional impact or clever twists that made the earlier seasons special. It felt rushed, soulless, and disconnected from what made the show great. Honestly, I'm so disappointed that even if they release more content related to Squid Game in the future, I won't be watching."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"Though not as intricate as Alice in Borderland or any similar web series, Squid Game manages to engage the audience till the end. Most characters have depth, and all the actors have done justice to their roles. Sound mixing and costume design are excellent. The actor who played an old man Oh Il Nam was one of the finest among the cast. His dialogue delivery and comic timing were so natural and he was likable(?;-)  Rating:  Story: 2.5/5 - Starts slow at first but not bad after the game starts.  Screenplay: 3.5/5 - Some unecessary (adult) scenes but pace is perfect  Characters & Acting: 4/5 - Few annoying characters, but rest are good. I didn't find anyone's acting below average.  Production Values: 5/5 - The costume design of guards and the front man, the VIP Masks, the wall decors, VFX, Sound Mixing, Lighting, etc were brilliant for a web series  Total: 15/20 - 8/10."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,Season one is fire and really feels like there are high stakes every game. The players are each enjoyable to watch whether you are rooting for them to die or hoping they survive the next game. A lot of emotional moments are done very well as they show moments where you really care for these people instead as seeing them as contestants in a game show. Overall season one was a gas season  Season 2 on the other hand feels extremely forced and not taken too seriously. Other than the GOAT Thanos and the friend of the main guy (don't know names) I didn't really care for like any of the new side characters and I'm still not sure what they added to this new season other than some family drama with the kid n his mom. Only 7 episodes and ends on a massive cliff hanger with only half of the games done. Feels kinda like they are dragging it at this point cause of the success of the first season. I like the new games but like nobody is dying (aside from the finale) so it's lacking the stakes that season one did so well. First episode was done extremely well and gave me false hope for the rest of the season (X O was a fire episode). Similar to the first season they continue to drop plot twists that don't hit as well as they probably intended on.  Overall Score: 83%

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"I watched the show because it was trending and I couldn't stop until I finished it. The idea behind the show is close to Hunger Games or Battle Royale, it's about a game where people die and there is friendship and betrayal, even if you watched hunger games and battle royale this is still new and a very beautiful show that is set apart.  The progression of the characters was beautiful, the acting was very good some say the VIP acting and dialog was bad, I didn't like it either but I think the dialog was meant to be stupid and cheezy like real psychopath rich people would have, it's like a separation from normal people and rich people with a sick mind, so if the VIP disturbed you I think that was the director's plan.  The show is pleasing to the eye and ears, even if the players were locked in a place every game was in a different setting and was beautifully designed, the tense music during the games makes you anxious, idk... just watch it already !!!"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"While the series deserves its enthusiastic reception for creating a tense atmosphere - although it seriously drops off towards the end, so don't expect too much -, the premise and story heavily borrow from the manga ""Gambling Apocalypse Kaiji"", which has been running from 1996. It's been adapted various times, first as an anime series in 2007. Which is when director Hwang Dong-hyuk admittedly started writing ""Squid Game"".  The similarities are too obvious to be ignored: the protagonist is an unemployed compulsive gambler (!) who finds himself whisked off to a ship in the middle of the ocean (!!), where he has to play increasingly daring games against other indebted people (!!!). They build teams to weather competition, and in the end they have to cross a glass bridge (!!!!). Creator Nobuyuki Fukumoto and publisher Kodansha have a strong case for copyright infringement as the credits fail to mention this ""inspiration"".  There have also been three movies based on the series (from 2009, 2011 and 2020) which are not very good as the acting leaves much to be desired. ""Squid Game"" definitely satisfies in this department, although it's not a masterpiece like Lee Chang-dong's ""Burning"" (2018) or the Oscar-winning ""Parasite"". But the audacity of this rip-off leaves a sour aftertaste, as it would if Bong Joon-ho would do a superhero movie called ""The Vengeancers""."

This is what happens when money sways the heads that created this. Originally only meant to be 1 season but feels like they forced 2 and 3, also they should have released 2 and 3 as one complete season.

Fans expected different things but did not see it because the creators had no influence on it because the series was already finished.

I've never been a huge Squid Game fan, I think it's a good show, but not something I'm obsessed with. This season just didn't click for me the same way. I wasn't really into the new characters, and the plot felt weaker compared to the first season. It just didn't have the same intensity or emotional impact. That said, I did really like the idea of a competition between Gi-Hun and the Front man. That dynamic was one of the best parts and kept me interested. Overall, it was fine, but not great. I'll still check out Season 3 when it comes, but I'm hoping it pulls me in more than this one did."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,3,,"I've watched the whole lot and it's just plain silly. The cast bring over-acting to a new level, all the characters are spectacularly annoying (I wanted them all to die by Episode 2) and I don't know why I watched it all. I'm sure there were far better things I could have been doing with my life. Like cleaning my bathroom or cutting my toe nails. It's really woeful."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"If not the best new show on TV--and it may be exactly that--certainly one of the most outrageous. Set in South Korea, it stars Lee Jung-jae as a hardcore gambler in debt to the mob with child support payments he can't maintain and medical bills for his ailing mom that he can no longer afford to pay. When he is offered a chance to make a not-so-small fortune by competing against several hundred other desperate souls in a high-stakes series of childrens' games, he grabs it--with absolutely no idea of what he has signed up for. At first, there's a repetitiveness to it all--everyone competes, the losers are massacred in a horrible bloodbath, the winners move on, rinse and repeat--and, terrifying as the story quickly becomes, you may start wondering if that's all there is. But then episodes six and seven come along, the suspense is ratcheted up even higher, the pool of players is winnowed down to a precious few, and the action really takes off. (Who knew that an ordinary game of marbles could turn into such a nailbiter?) The premise is brilliant, the acting is magnificent (Jung-jae, with his large eyes and expressive face, leads an extraordinarily talented cast), and the stunt work is amazing. Not for the faint of heart--there are more corpses here than at your local boneyard--but if you can stomach the more cringeworthy moments, ""Squid Game"" is quite a ride. The ending is a jaw-dropper, too. It's already been renewed for a second season, and I can't wait."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"Story the game and the story of the main character is excellent but the ending is the only thing that made me give it 9, not 10 but the show is worth watching ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Characters The preforms are great and the writing of the characters are amazing ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Extra Soundtracks are unique.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"If I'm being honest, I only watched it because I was bored. I never properly watched season 1(sorry). I knew the basics of everything to continue on and understand what was happening... but holy shart do I regret it. If this season was so good, then what the flippergy gibble stick is season one to make people go flipping insane. I was expecting it to be some really shot remake. They used the the concept's from season 1 but gave them an intriguing twist making everything all the more better., I watched this with my mother and grandma screaming at the TV. The twists were insane, and mind blowing. You could predict things, but not everything, the director did a great job to make you feel the intensity through the facial expressions. I'm going to go watch season 1. Season 3 will be flippin amazing if this is how they are building it up. This would have been a 10 but I feel as though there were extra scenes which were not needed... and in the end when they shoot, the editor's did booty cheeks cuz if you pause it it would literally be shows the shots were fake. Guess they weren't making the budget bye I'm watching season 1... again... properly.."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"Season 1 = 9.5/10 Season 2 = 8/10 Season 3= 9/10  Many people have said Season 3 was bad but I just finished watching it & I loved it. Great ending to a fantastic show imo.  I loved season 1 & couldn't really get into Season 2 when it first came out. I watched the first two episodes of the second season and stopped, figuring I would wait & watch it when Season 3 came out & glad I did.  Watching the rest of the 2nd Season & the 3rd together worked great & better than watcching Season 2 on it's own.  The ending won't be for everyone but I loved it, Season 3 passed my expectations. Good acting, good Directing & good writing.  Check this show out & watch season 2 right before the 3rd Season. Give the 2 last season's a proper chance!"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,Acting very hit or miss. Ending kinda wack. Vip scenes were extremely cringey and poorly done. Plot holes here and there. Things that are really unbelievable like 2 people getting away with using a lighter in the honeycomb game.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Even if you've seen ""The Hunger Games"" and ""Money Heist"", ""Squid Game"" (called ""Ojing-eo Geim"" in the original Korean) is still going to shock you. The sad thing is that so many people have no other choice but to risk everything like the characters here.  Definitely see it. You'll never look at any children's game the same way again after seeing it."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"Season 1 of this show was amazing. It was entertaining, gripping, stressful, engaging, interesting and I could not stop watching it. I binged all episodes back to back to back, taking very few breaks because how into it I was.  Season 2 however, is a complete joke. Not sure why I expected much from Netflix. They tend to take and amazing show, and tank it by the 2nd season. I became concerned when I saw that there are only 7 episodes this season as compared to Season one's 9 episodes. By Episode 5, I was already disengaged from this season. There is WAY too much meaningless dialogue between characters that no one cares about. There is WAY too much dialogue in general. Lots of topic points repeated in dialogue over and over. Comedic bits that are very awkwardly placed. Too much attention paid to political/identity agendas. I actually fell asleep three times watching this show and by the third time, I didn't bother rewinding back because honestly, I didn't care about what I missed. I was afraid Netflix would once again ruin an amazing show. They did not disappoint.  I mean, everything after Season 2 Episode 2 is so bad, IMDB hasn't released them for review on their website. It's like they already know how terrible these episodes really are. I'm surprised I haven't cancelled my Netflix subscription yet. If they manage to ruin the final season of Stranger Things that will be the last straw. No more Netflix for me."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,2,,"There is no deeper message here. It's just the same old tropes but packaged in very expensive production. It's the premise of Saw dialed up to a hundred, with the same shadowy cabal of puppet masters and wealthy elites making the poors kill each other for sport on widescreens that we've seen in endless iterations already in the last decade, like in Escape Room to name but one example. The show likes to present itself as more cunning and introspective than it really is, when at its core it is just mean-spirited schadenfreude pantomiming as societal critique.  It looks visually very impressive, but it is so hollow and cynical that after the first few episodes it just feels like you yourself are being tortured by having to endure the never-ending meat grinder of despair. The cop's storyline is also so contrived, and induces some of the biggest eyerolls in an environment that is already straining the suspension of disbelief far beyond its maximum elasticity.  So I guess watch this if you want to feast your eyes on some majestic set pieces and also if you hate people."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,,,"Listen, having my eardrums busted with the hype surrounding this show I thought I'd give it a go! Authentic yes but there's only so much bloodshed before it becomes a bore. If you've got a few hours to kill give it a shot, overrated, would not be in my top 20 series - box sets!"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"This is an entertaining series from South Korea that embodies elements of Korean Soap Opera, Chinese Operatic acting and Japanese theater. It uses classical Chinese opera techniques such as the wide open eyes to portray fear and anger....and a lot of shouting.  It uses ""Hunger Games"" as it's base and survival of the fittest as its main theme. The story is well crafted but unfortunately starts to lose its grip on reality by about episode 4. It then slides into a lot of moralizing and philosophical conversations that culminates in the final episode. It is set up for a second season (if one can judge from the final episode) but runs the risk of becoming very formula driven Have to agree with the other comments about the group of ""actors"" playing the VIPs. They obviously came cheap and might not even have been actors at all! Enjoyable for what it's meant to be!"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,Superbly made. This is something different that was made with thought and passion. If I don't recommend it to others then I don't actually what's actually one should. Bravo!
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,One of the best shows I've seen in a long time. Acting was pretty good and the story and plot were crazy.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Great Korean actors, the main ones performance impeccable. Couldn't stop watching. Watched the nine hours series in one weekend. Yeah the VIP performance sucks but i guess they have stored it for the next seasons. Korean horror movies, train to busan, parasite, squid game rocks!"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"I recently got into Netflix again I take breaks and use other services glad I finally decided to watch this whacky series! Probably get hate for this but I watch the English dub version cause I don't do well with subtitles still lovable show. The music, flow of everything, absurdity, and story is all excellent!"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"Squid Game throws you right into a wild setup where everyday folks play deadly kids' games for a huge cash prize. The main idea is sharp and packs a punch-it's a clear jab at money problems and how far people might go when they're desperate. You'll find yourself hooked by how simple the rules are and how deep the message runs.  The actors do a solid job of selling the fear and hope you'd feel in that spot. Scenes pop with bright colors and tense beats that keep you guessing. There are moments that truly land, making you think and even wince at the same time.  But here's the catch: after a while, things start to drag. Some plot threads feel stretched out, and you might catch yourself wondering, ""Do we really need another round of this game?"" By the final episodes, the thrill wears thin, and the story could've wrapped up sooner without losing its punch.  Still, if you're up for a show that swings hard at class and cash struggles, Squid Game delivers more hits than misses. Just be ready for a bit of a slog before the finish line."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"Really fun concept of a show that takes time to develop the characters and make you care and understand them before the games begin. Started very strong up until episode 6, then went downhill with all the VIP stuff and plot twists and turns that undermined characters and story stuff earlier on. Has great production values and acting. Episode 6 was the best one by a mile, but the last three episodes were pretty weak overall and makes me a bit worried how Season 2 will turn out.  8/10 for Season 1."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"Episode 1 starts off a bit too slow but towards the end things get interesting. Episode 2 to 7 is amazing and provides something a bit different from what we've seen in the past year or so.  Episode 8 and 9 are terrible, they don't make any sense! I really don't want to include too many spoilers in this review.  Overall, we'll done to the main characters. The acting was amazing!!!!"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,Acting 10/10 Story 10/10.  I higly recommend this series.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"Despite the critics and some mixed reviews, I genuinely enjoyed Season 2 of Squid Game. The storyline felt more intense, and I appreciated how the series delved deeper into the characters' backstories. The psychological tension and moral dilemmas were gripping, keeping me on the edge of my seat. Sure, some moments might have felt a bit stretched or over dramatic, but overall, the show stayed true to its unique premise. New games added, The visuals and performances were outstanding, and it left me thinking about the choices we make under pressure. For me, Season 2 was a worthy continuation of an unforgettable series."""
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Now that the 3rd season has come out, I can safely say the entire show is INSANELY good and wasn't ruined in the end! So thankful for that! It may differ from person to person, but I personally felt it all ended in perfection.  The concept, the characters, the sets, the music, the story, everything was soo well made and unique!! Makes me sad it's finally over :'(  I personally feel that the 2nd and 3rd season are 100 times better, way more creative and have more lovable characters than the original 1st season but still love all of them and all are necessary to watch, I mean c'mon, Thanos isn't in the 1st season, just saying.  The cons would be as everyone has mentioned, the stupid VIPs, can't act to save their lives and all that comes out of their mouths is usually filthy and pointless! It takes up valuable time in the episodes that could have been used in other places...yes I get their purpose but they needed to be reworked.  Another con would be that some things were left unexplained that I felt needed to be but all in all it didn't hurt the whole show enough for me, I just wanted more as it's that good.  It's 100% worth a watch depending on who you are, there's tons of violence, gore and dark psychological themes along with a great story, which is why I love it so much and haven't found anything like this to date.  Honestly, I feel like the ratings on the last season look a bit wrong/fudged or people expected something different out of what the show is all about, I wouldn't at all say the last season was horrible, actually on the contrary, we'll see if the ratings get any better over the next few days, I really hope so since it really does deserves high marks!  This show is now one of my ABSOLUTE FAVORITES!! I'll definitely be watching this whole thing again a few more times before I inevitably cancel my Netflix subscription...so stupid it has to be solely on Netflix, that's the biggest con.  The actors really should get some kind of an award for the 3rd season acting, so good!  The gist: insanely good show, would recommend it over and over again for its overall unique story vibe.  Ok, I better stop here before I spoil something lol  **May be a tiny spoiler**  The 3rd season had me extremely stressed but I actually like that kinda thing soo, imo it was very well done and accomplished exactly what squid game was supposed to even if it was very stressful, definitely was on the edge of my seat and rewarded lol."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"For those who did not understand the psychological projection of the series. Basically, The series discusses the brutality of the capitalist economy system in such a clever way that you'll definitely notice and say when you're watching ""that character is me!"".  It is that under the dominance of the capitalist system all people are in a race to get money that only one person takes in the end. The same money that come from the blood and sweat of others.  The capitalist system claims that there is equity And justice in the distribution of the wealth. And this is far from the truth.  As for the big capitalists who control the big capitals and companies that run the entire process, money is no longer their pleasure. That they only find pleasure in people suffer."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"Fast forwarded through the second and third season somehow. Let's just call it season 2.1 and 2.2 shall we, it was one story.  Yes the writer found success through the first season after a life of toil. Good for him, he deserves all the success. But he could have put in the effort to develop a decent story. Instead they decided to just ride the hype and hang up their pencils and say let the series write itself. Cliched subplots made the side characters pathetic and unrelatable at best... borderline intolerable. Yes the VIP acting was terrible. But so was literally every other thing about the follow up season. But you can't really expect more from backward and narrow-minded creators. They went straight for the orthodox mainstream primitive-minded audiences, checked creativity and imagination out at the door and rode the gravy train to money. I will not be following a single thing this writer does in the future. He might be bored of the newfound success in a decade and decide to get back to his passion, but till then I think we can safely skip anything they do.  I will not be wasting my time on season 3, that is for damn sure."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,It is a nice thriller drama that kept me hook throughout.  I love battle royal concept and this is one of the best in this concept.  Acting was so good and cameos were amazing.  I recommended for you to watch it.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"If you have nothing else to do then give it a try.  The characters are a cliche, the story is the same old good evil greed narrative, the concept is ok and the cop-brother storyline is just boring.  It reminded me of Gantz! They could have added some elements from the anime and make it better. It would have been a good mix.  Overall, 6/10.  Take your popcorn, your drinks, your chicken wings and enjoy."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"I dont know how it happend, but a couple of days ago i was memorising my childhood (thats not happening a lot). And then i had a strong memory about this childhood game we used to play as kids in the neighborhood. And guess what? That game was the 1st game those players in this tv show played (i dont remember its name in a foreign language), the one they needed to freeze after the count stop... So i was realy amazed by finding this great tv show. Its seriously shown how our mind worked as kids and how we been more active as kids- as shown Through all the games in this amazing tv show. So yes its a big 10/10 for me.  Recommended to any human being on this earth."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"I didn't go into this season with high hopes. The first season was a little hard to watch, and this isn't the sort of genre that lends itself well to sequels. I think those are big issues. However once I started watching the new season, I couldn't stop. I must say I was pretty amazed at how intelligent the writing is and how engaging the acting is. I like this season even better than the last. The characters are more likable. The mystery of it is more gripping. There are no accidents, no plot contrivances. They have veered from the formula, but in a good way. It is going to upset the fans of torture porn to see this chess game unfold. Especially if they can't see the bigger picture of what us really happening. It always amuses me to see these pseudo intellectual critics pretending they are smarter than the thing they don't understand. The one big mistake they made was cutting the story off in the middle, instead of releasing one episode a week and making it one season. It ends on a simmer when people are waiting for the full boil."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,Nothing else to say but wow. This show had me on edge of my seat for 9 hours. Like a cross of Hunger Games x The Purge and Would You Rather. If you like thriller/suspense this show is for you.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,An absolute gem from South Korea. Amazing show from the first ep. To the last one. A must see...
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"Korean TV shows are traditionally a step below their movies, which have been the best in the world for a while now. With its budget, production quality and talent Squid Game could have been the one show that got away but all is sadly ruined by Lee Jung-jae overacting pretty much every scene he's in, he just doesn't seem to be able to ground his character. Granted, some of the writing is over the top too, which doesn't help but the director should have helped him calibrate. In comparison Gong Yoo and especially Lee Byung-hun own the screen and ooze charisma every single time despite very brief appearances.  It's still a good show and overall quite watchable but it's just not great."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Korean cinema has been surprising a lot and squid game brought a very well constructed plot following a line of facts that interconnect very well with each other, I loved the way the suspense left nothing to be desired and has an amazing plot. Great!"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"This is a series with a first season full of excellent episodes in every sense. Above all, the writing stood out, with its character design, the complexity of the plot, moral dilemmas, and emotional connections. Basically, a masterpiece. Additionally, the sound design deserves praise-especially the now-iconic melody we all recognize. Similarly, the set design was colorful, creative, and creepy at the same time.  Finally, the acting. While not all performances were stellar, even the weakest ones were decent enough not to disrupt the flow of the story. However, I must admit that I didn't like the ending-it was unnecessarily long and had a cliffhanger that didn't make much narrative sense. Still, it wasn't bad enough to make me regret watching the series. That's what the second season was for.  The second season started strong; in fact, the first episode delivered a stellar performance. However, from then on, it became clear that the plot would turn against itself, lacking all the qualities that initially made it so compelling. There was no longer any complexity in the characters, no progress in their arcs, and no strong emotional connections were formed.  The games were barely salvageable, along with one or two mildly emotional scenes. The rest was a complete waste of time-enough to make me wish I'd never started this series in the first place."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,Very cool Way way better than the Hunger Games.... Its in the same twisted vein as the recent Japanese TV series Alice in Borderland  A must watch.

Even in these covid times, this film creator and director does know how to pull audiences with a mix of keeping the tradition but develop modern series!  Thank you so much for this wonderful series!"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"Season 1 was honestly amazing. The story, the characters, the tension-it all just worked. It felt fresh, emotional, and had me completely hooked from the start. Easily one of the best shows I've watched in a while.  Season 2 was decent. It had a few good moments and explored more of what goes on behind the scenes, but it didn't hit as hard. Still enjoyable, just not as memorable as the first.  Season 3 really fell flat for me. The games felt recycled, the new characters didn't leave much of an impact, and the ending felt rushed and kind of pointless.  Overall, definitely worth watching for Season 1. 7/10 from me."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,2,,Second season nowhere come near the first season...Such a waste of time...I binge watched the whole series in one day and it really be the worst time wasting series...There is no thrill or emotional attachment in the second season as we experienced in first season.....After 7 terrible hours we come to know that the story never moves through the end of the second season...And it was terrible cliffhanger where story never moves even after 7 episodes...After watching the whole second season you will be left out where you started and the end of the first season...If you want to burn some hours there are more series than this trash...

Tons of plot twists that add depth to characters and the plot itself. This is one of a kind show (genre & quality wise). You wont find anything like this anywhere. It is absolutely well written.  I want to remove my memories and watch this again.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"This show is really good and exciting. The cast is doing a really good job and I cared for the characters. The sets and camerawork were also beautiful there was not much action but when there was it was well shot.

I almost always can't seem to get into foreign films but Squid Game had me by my lady balls! It's uncomfortable yet staggeringly exciting. I feel almost guilty for saying that but it's a twist that I have never seen done within a movie. Hunger game, maze runner, none of those can compare. I want MORE!!!!"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,I've just finished the last episode yesterday so I gave myself a day to recollect my thoughts.  I don't want to write spoilers but as I see how big is the hype around it it's almost impossible to do so.  If you haven't seen any movies with similar message then then you'll probably will give this one higher score for sure.  I saw many and have to say that it is a solid 7/10 The character build up starts okay. Later episodes mess up this with the so called VIP's characters are bad. Add bad acting too.  The conversations are a bit plain.  The storyline is too predictable but not bad.  The settings and visuals are very good.  The games are good too.  The ending is very meh.  So these are my thoughts without spoilers.  (I watched it in English as I read about it is a slightly different then the Korean original)
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"This show is incredible and sad at the same time because it shows us human nature in a world dominated by the value of money, how far we can go by having money on one side and how sick those who have money are, in short we are doomed for money."

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"I did not expect it to be so good! This series shows the depths of human behavior, reminded me for a moment Black Mirror.  Just watch and you won't regret it. I'm becoming a fan of Korean movies and series. They know how to do the job.  Wonderful script, Intriguing,funny, touching and frightening All at once."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"I continue to be impressed by Korean shows and movies. I really love them. This is a great show that I hope will go on. The characters are excellent, the games are anxiety-inducing and scary, and will have you dying to see what's next, and actual character development takes place throughout. I felt so many emotions watching this; I was moved. One of the biggest highlights for me was the relationship between Gi-hun and Sang-woo. The tension was built up over time and subtlety at first, and the story as a whole was done nicely. I also really liked the undercover cop/brother of the Frontman, and was heartbroken when his story ended the way it did. Everything he did was to find his brother, and what happened to him really made you disgusted with the Frontman and the whole organization.  I thought the Tug-of-War challenge was the most disturbing one. To think about how it would feel standing at one side of the rope knowing you have to yank a group of people to their death so it's not done to you makes me wince.  If I had to add some critique, I would agree with other reviews about the VIPs. Their acting was horrible and did not fit in with the rest of the show. But they just weren't a big enough element to really affect my rating."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"In my opinion, ""Squid Game"" is overhyped, and I don't see any other reason than good marketing and viral advertisement.  The story is nothing new: game, where the last survivor(s) get(s) the prize. We had seen it in anime, tv-shows, and movies like ""Cube"". Nothing special. What Squid Game does different? Actually, not much. It discloses the motivation of the characters, which is, eventually, irrelevant. It allows to fill half of a season instead of filming 1.5 hour movies.  Do I think it's a bad show? No, it's decent and I don't regret watching it. Yet it's quite basic in every possible respect, distinguished by quality of the scenes, but not content.."

No.  Because, this drama, despite its gruesome violence, is pretty light. It doesn't have a deeper message nor a plot that makes you stop and think a lot. At one point, it's just a game and you even stop feeling for whoever that dies.  Pros:     Cons:     Anyway, I have been watching kdrama for a while now, and I should say Squid Game is not the best kdrama I have seen. But it definitely is not the worst. It's a fun ride. With awesome OSTs and BGs. Everyone should check this out."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,4,,"Season 1 of Squid Game had a unique and gripping storyline that kept me watching multiple episodes nonstop. However, season 2 felt like a bad joke, almost a poor imitation.  Most viewers likely don't want to see a rerun of season 1's games and story in ""season 2."" If that's what you're after, I strongly suggest rewatching season 1 instead.  The first and last episodes of season 2 were somewhat different (and not necessarily better), but the rest added little to the plot. The ending was unsatisfying.  I wish there were no season 2, as it just ruined the image of the series in my mind. I won't be waiting for or watching season 3."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"I haven't read any reviews yet but I don't have to for this one. This was a little slow to pick up, cliché, predicable, has some spotty acting, and I didn't like the progression of the games or the last episode. Those are all my nitpicks and even with those, I still feel like I have to give this a ten.  So, why the ten? This just reminded me of Breaking Bad and A Game of Thrones when it should have reminded me of Battle Royale and so on. This is because I simply chewed through this content. The character development is amazing, loved the anti-capitalism overtone, the scenery was great, the dubbing was very well done, the acting for the most part was topnotch and there are some really good memorable, quotable and heartfelt moments. I'll keep it short. If the trailer interested you, you probably won't be disappointed.  ""Everyone is equal here"" ""You think money can fix everything""?"

The characters feel real, and you can really connect with their struggles and emotions.  The games are creative but terrifying, and the bright, colorful sets make everything even more unsettling. It's not just about survival-it also makes you think about human nature and what people will do when pushed to the edge.  The actors did an incredible job, especially Lee Jung-jae. Every episode is full of suspense and keeps you guessing. If you enjoy shows with action, drama, and deep messages, Squid Game is definitely worth watching!"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"So far, I've watched season 1 and 2. (shall watch the rest once they are released.) I'm really enjoying the story line.

Also, everyone who doesn't normally watch Korean movies and shows think this is the best. It's up there with the best of them but it's not the best one I've seen..but yeah, I still rate it highly. All the people leaving negative reviews..do you even normally watch Korean dramas? ..and also..if you're stupid enough to ever watch a foreign movie with dubbed voices, it's your loss!

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"This drama is probably one of the most compelling battle royale content out there. The last episode was a bit boring as it tried to set up a bridge towards season 2, but overall the dram has a really interesting storyline."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"Squid Game is a well-executed K-Drama by Netflix, and Hwang Dong-hyuk did a great job bringing it to life. The concept in Season 1 is super original, which definitely helps it stand out. Season 1 alone makes this a top tier series and is definitely worth watching.  Season 2 starts off pretty strong, especially the first couple of episodes with Gong Yoo, who really elevates them with how good his acting is. But after that, the season kind of loses steam. The rest felt a bit underwhelming to me.  Season 3 begins slowly and eventually builds to a decent enough ending, but the final episode feels rushed, like it's just trying to wrap everything up as quickly as possible. It left me feeling like the story wasn't completely finished.  That said, overall, the series is still really enjoyable and a solid pick if you're new to K-Dramas. It's original, and well made."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"Let's start with the Korean drama that took the world by storm in 2021. I enjoyed this Korean drama, along with many others. However, I felt like it fell flat in the last few episodes. It comments on social status, financial status, and how humans treat one another are hard-hitting. The idea there are people in such financial struggle they would risk their and other people's lives is heart-breaking, yet eye-opening. The incorporation of well-known children's games is a great device used by the creator to connect the audience to the characters. Reminding them of their childhood but also understanding the stress and difficulties of playing these games with such high stakes. I will say the poor acting from the English actors did break the illusion for me, and also ended, which I will not share with those of you that are yet to watch. If you are not a fan of horror and gore I do not recommend this K-Drama for you, another wise I think it's a brilliant watch, but 100% watch in Korean with Subs...Dub is not good."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"I don't watch many foreign shows or movies, but with all the popularity surrounding this show I just had to watch it. ""Squid Game"" is a very engaging show that keeps you hooked in with its various twists and surprises that keep you watching. While the last episode failed to satisfy some aspects of the series, it still wrapped things up nicely and did a great job of showing the consequences of a society were the rich are the only ones who benefit. Very excited for season two."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"Squid Game is a bit overrated for me. But its entertaining from the first to the last episode. The storytelling is very good and the ideas of the games are very nice.

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,Absolutely amazing show. A must watch for people that can handle it. Episodes are always interesting.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,2,,"I thought season 1 was like an interesting roller coaster ride but season 2 didn't do it for me. The main character and some of the side characters got on my nerves from time to time and I really didn't care enough about anyone to be passionate about whether they lived or died other than on a basic human level of wanting everyone to live. I'm more upset that I spent all these hours watching this especially with that ridiculous ending. The payoff was not worth the journey. It had its moments but overall, it was a decent watch. Much of the storyline and character charisma was in season 1. I also didn't like the direction they chose to go with the main character this time around but that's just me. Lastly, they spent too much time on subpar characters and some characters were not needed at all. I. E. The guy with the cross around his neck was so cringe and irritating to me. This was a season of frustration for me. Very unsatisfying and disappointing. Maybe Season 3 will be better, if they decide to go another round."

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"""Squid Game"" is a show meant to appeal to its viewers twisted inner child. It's not just the games themselves, but the brightly coloured, oversize playground in which the players are forced to live and compete. The storytelling is relatively simple and straightforward. And the satirical elements about the evil billionaires who come to bet on the game can at times feel like how a grade schooler."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"Squid Game had one of the best concepts, with mystery around few people who participates in a game with millions to win. The story is simple yet creative and it works most of the entire series.  The start was strong, with violence and bloodshed during the games which built an intense environment to leave us guessing what would happen next.  The story went through well with a good last episode as well. But it still felt that it was not finished as it should have been ended, with an open ending hinting for Season 2 (Although I would have preferred this to end in a single season)."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"The concept of the show is very unique and it was really interesting. But the show was really slow paced. So, if you don't have the patience you might even quit. Acting was good except the few VIPs whose acting were horrible. The show makes you emotional towards various characters."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,Don't know if there will be a second season. The end for the first one does not have the same value as the rest of the series.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"This movie offers nothing new within this genre of movie but it does deliver its story in a solid, pleasant way, wrapped in very well designed and visually appealing sets.  The only major problem I have with it is the acting.  It's not that the acting is bad (except for a few exceptions) but more so that characters are acted out in a comic- or anime-style way, which is what the director wanted, I guess.  Almost everything is over-the-top and at least for my taste cringe-worthy and comical instead of realistic. For example: you will often see 'fear of death' portrayed (acted) in a hilarious, comical way, which can (at least for some people) be extremely awkward, since the movie has an overall dark, serious and brutal tone. This contrast does not work well, at least for me.  So, if you like extreme over-acting and enjoy seeing anime-style behavior in a real movie: go for it. Otherwise you may find if off-putting."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,2,,"Season 2 is just embarrassing when compared with the first. The quality of writing has dropped to such an extent that I felt myself getting older as I watched the show. The decision to include someone who I understand to be a pop star to 'act' as one of the principal antagonists was, unfortunately, a horrible mistake as the character portrayed was cringeworthy, boring, and felt like an insult when compared to the quality of season 1 overall. This decision in particular was the inspiration for the title of this review. I mean, the character literally says ""Skrrt!"" unironically.  Beyond this key complaint of mine, I would also point out that several other elements of the show's second season leave much to be desired, particularly the predictability of the events which take place. I shan't spoil anything in this review, but just know that between myself and the person who I was watching this show with, we predicted the plot of season 2 and ended up fast forwarding through segments of the episodes with a sigh and the occasional comment of ""what is this?!""  Lastly a comment on the music in the second season. It is god-awful provoking laughter at serious moments and confusion during other moments. Just bizarre.  Overall a massive disappointment and certainly not anything to write home about (or indeed buy a netflix subscription for)  It gets two stars because at least it had audio and video."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,Very good tv show as i expected from the Korean shows but i think the storytelling is not very well although the characters are well written And i liked the Design and Music also some twist events.

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"10/10 First season was remarkable, novel games and thrilling/devastating death scenes for characters you loved, hated, and didn't feel much for. The story telling was 10/10 on all sides, like the gruelling critique of human nature and greed and resilience. The open ending was perfect and should have been left at that.  5/10 Second season was so disappointing for me. The story telling was lacking. They built up the characters and relationships but found them still lacking in complexity like the first season. The games and death scenes were not nearly as novel. The action scenes drones on at times."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"If you can deal with the graphic violence you'll enjoy a well acted, well directed mini masterpiece about the human psyche, desperation, relationships, greed, selfishness and sacrifice. Refreshing to watch after all the predictable dross out there. Just about long enough too. Recommended."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"I liked the first season well enough. The premise was obviously ridiculous, but that can be a great premise for a show. The ""Battle Royale"" aspects of it are as universal as ""Lord of the Flies"".  The second season is pretty bad. It's very melodramatic and over-acted. The direction is bad. And, it takes a long time to get back to the thing that people found so ""fun"" about the first season: the silly games for which desperate people might want to kill each other to win some money.  In this case, our first season's hero returns with all the over-acting he can muster, but this time he's a selfless purpose...  Revenge! Revenge will be obtained in full if season two of Squid Game fails...  But ""revenge"" will somehow prove hollow if season two is as successful as the first -- which it doesn't deserve.  Meh."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"All 9episoded are worth watching this is the one of the series that gives the impact of guilt, sadness, sorrow, love and all humans emotions. It has a very grip screenplay. I loved the background score and it elevates the scene and emotions to the next level."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"I enjoyed S01 of ""Squid Game"" well enough. Once I adjusted to the shock factor of childhood games turned into bloodbaths, the social commentary was engaging, and so I gave S02 a shot. What a frustrating waste of time. With each episode, my anger actively grew. By E06, I was fully hate-watching, yet powered through, if only to justify the hours already spent. And for what? A season so grotesque, so gratuitous in its violence, that whatever sharp critique on capitalism or power structures it attempted to convey was buried under layers of nastiness and brutality. And the way the final episode ended with everything up in the air was the coup de grâce. At a time when the world already feels politically, environmentally, and psychosocially bleak, this season felt like an exercise in masochism. I don't need more brutality dressed up as entertainment; I need unicorns, koalas, rainbows, sunshine, and smiles. You can skip this flaming pile of poo and find tons of superior K-dramas out there."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,5,,"This was first korean show ever and it the first season did not disappoint, all the characters and subplot are really amazing. Season was really nail biting as the viewer is always kept on the edge. But as the show gained popularity next season was announced. And as I expected the quality of the show really declined and main character become invincible and you cannot really care about the new characters because they do not have any real depth. The only enjoyable character in the show was thanos. I wished the show ended after season 1 but here we are waiting for the 3rd season and the damage to the show has already been done."

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"Episodes 1-6 were addictive, intense, original, clever and shocking. Genuinely incredible TV.  Episodes 7-9 had some good twists but overall empty and missing that something special."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"I guess I got sucked into the hype around this and was curious about this show, the premise looked fun so I went for it. I finished it in 2 days, which is a testament to the show I guess, but it didn't leave me satisfied.  Individually it has some great episodes. But the overall story is weak, and spends too much time with mumbling about irrelevant things. This being most prominent with the whole cop storyline. It's very poorly done and has no payoff whatsoever. It seemed like a excuse just to show some of the workings inside the facility. I wish they cut out the cop plot completely because it was worthless.  The directing is good overall, not the greatest but it is a visually appealing show, but this is more so caused by the superb set design. This show definitely has a few ''wow'' moments when shown a new area or room. This also made the next games a lot more interesting and made you curious for how the next game looks.  Now the games themselves, the marble game is simply the best because of its drama, and the most striking I think is the first game. Besides that, the other games aren't that great. Mainly due to the poor CGI.  Now there is a ton of gore and blood here, and most of it is good. But you can notice when it gets sloppy. The main offenders are the CGI used for people when they fall. It looks very unrealistic and low quality if that makes sense. It's not a convincing effect and a couple of games use that it makes them a lot less fun to watch.  The acting was great for the Korean actors. The VIPs are another story, now I wouldn't say their acting was bad. But the dialog that was written was horrible. It felt like a parody of how rich people talk, when that was obviously not intended.  The finale, the answers we got were lackluster, there are a couple of plotholes, the reveal was alright though, I liked that. But then... unless the hair change is a symbol for something I don't get it, and the airport scene felt rushed.  Overall it's a fun series but don't look to far into it. It's got good fx, nice acting and amazing set pieces, but that's that. (watched in Korean language, not dubbed)  Season 2 Update: Season 2 is more of the same, but a weird one and a drop in quality sadly. While season 1 might have been able to pull at your heart strings, season 2 takes a different angle and really plays up the comedy element. But it fails in all aspect. It neither lands the fun comedy consistently nor the emotional impact. The new characters are just incredibly lazy in writing and super cliché. And let's not even mention this being a full season, stretched over 2 seasons. And one of the worst finales. I had some fun here and there. But it will not be memorable like the first. Also the off island plot .... Incredibly bad. Sadly I have to rate down to 6/10 instead of 7."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,It's definitely not usual korean drama. It doesn't have any romance or any thing. So any one even who don't like korean drama can enjoy it.  If you like escape room or Alice in boarderland it is definitely your kind of series. Story is simple a group of people play children's games and who loses will die. Even it is children's games it will keep you at the edge. That's also the speciality of the series.  This series will never going to disappoint you It's worth every bit of your time.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,Really enjoyed this. Thought it was just going to be full of blood and guts (which there is alot of) but actually I found myself getting invested in the characters and enjoying the moral dilemmas the characters have to make. Looking forward to a second series.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"Everything boils down to bad guys in South Korea. They're not Korean, or even Asian. They're European Caucasians. Get that. The only white people in this whole series are cast as the irredeemable bad guys. I'm sure it's just a coincidence."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,I stayed up till 4 AM watching this one. After seeing Squid Games i will be heading into a Korean Film binge watch. What a story where the elite rule the world. Hmmm could this be another case where the bank rollershave to shows us their intent before doing so?
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Definitely watch this! After the first episode I was absolutely glued to the programme, I watched 5 episodes in one go, it was that good.  Personally I preferred to watch it in the original language Korean with English subtitles, I believe it makes the programme much more believable.  The American dubs were just awful.  Fantastic acting by all. It has 2 brilliant twists at the end too!  Enjoy!"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"No dull moments, a show where the interactions and scenes really matter. If you watch carefully and pay attention the the players numbers there is a ton of foreshadowing.  The acting is great, and Gi-hun's character growth is astounding. The games range from brutal, to jarring, to gut wrenching, to jaw dropping. Fairly gruesome.  Terrific ending, but I can't imagine season 2 living up to this. Really great show can't recommend enough."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,Season 1 was excellent with twists and turns but season 2 was not satisfying I mean this time it was expected from gihun to go back to the game again and play I thought he will investigate in a different way and the worst thing was they didn't show the climax that how he is going to end this game and extended it to season 3 I mean there was no point in extending the season of they would have added 2 more episodes it would have concluded the show the makers are not understanding this will reduce their audience I don't think so people will be that excited to watch season 3 beacause they will think again they are going to extend the show.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"Squid Game delivers a truly gripping and original viewing experience. Across all three seasons, it combines deadly games with a distinctly Korean atmosphere, strong visual style, and tense decision-making that reflects real human behavior - some players help, others sabotage. That mix of psychology, survival, and social commentary makes the show stand out.  Characters like Ali, Gi-hun, Sae-byeok, and the mysterious Frontman are well-developed and leave a strong impression. The acting is solid across the board, and the show's production design and game concepts are incredibly creative and intense.  Not everything lands perfectly, though. The side story with the police officer feels underdeveloped and doesn't add much progress to the overall plot. The ending, while not traditionally satisfying, fits the tone of the series - sometimes a ""bad"" ending is the more realistic one.  Squid Game isn't just hype - it's a smart, brutal, and emotionally intense show that explores power, desperation, and the choices people make under pressure. Highly recommended for anyone interested in Korean media or intense survival dramas."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"The first season of this series was very good with a strong story and direction. In season 1, you were hooked at every moment and waiting for the next minute. But season 2, like all other movies, was just for sales and more revenue, No excitement, no interesting story, no suspenseful situations. Nothing. The only change they made was changing the games. The main character of the series is extremely stupid and ignorant in season 2. At the beginning of season 2, I was expecting action and police events, but he surprisingly did stupid things. When you're up against a big team, you should have acted smarter. His brain wasn't even working hard enough to bring a small thing inside with him, like that one's cross of Christ. In short, it wasn't worth the time and energy I put into it. It was awful."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Its definitely a 10/10 series, amazing performance by all actors!! Waiting for season 2 eagerly."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"Season 1 was a total surprise, you never knew what to expect.  On the other hand, season 3 is a total Cliché. At the beginning of each series you already knew what will be the end of it.  It's like writers were under pressure to finish the script. I guess they gathered all the known cliché and filtered the ones they hoped will generate most emotions and drama.  Overall acting was good, except for VIPs who were acting like kids in school.  Technical aspects are good  In the end, it's kind of nice to watch, but don't expect anything exceptional as it was Season 1. It's another show that should run in the background while you do something else."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,5,,"First off: the idea with child games contests leading to death has been done before in Takashi Miikes ""Kamisama no iu tôri."" It almost feel a bit shameful how they just lifted that idea from that movie and especially from a so known director.  Second: I mostly have experience with South Korean horror movies and i've always thought that South Korean acting was more realistic and western compared to the more theatrical overacted Japanese and Chinese, but the acting in Squid Game definitely feels more theatrical, which is not a good thing imo. It's hard to connect with the story and the actors when they're expressing every emotion with shouting, flailing their arms and making exaggerated faces. This might be a cultural thing and obviously people like that kind of acting in Asia, but i prefer the realistic kind.  Third: The VIPs... Listen, South Korean movie makers: Stay away from ""actors"" from the West who moves to SK to try their luck because they were unemployable on the Western market. They were horrible. Just terrible.  Finally: Squid Game could've been compressed to three hours and still lend lots of time for character development, interactions, the games, the B plot and everything else. This series was way way WAY too drawn out and got constantly stuck in all these overacted scenes with drawn out emotions. The games wasn't fun (and we've seen it before) and once again; got stuck, drawn out and boring."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,Koreans don't hold back. They make stuff as real as possible. They show how ruthless life in without any filter. This show was very well made and nicely paced. The games were well thought out and implemented. Even though we kind of know whose gonna win they masked that well. There was also good character choices and development in the film. The plot twist at the end was awesome too. Very mature dialogues and story! The sets were also well thought out and colorful and the background music was unique and fit well. Very entertaining show.

It was about time !!!"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"Let's be honest - Squid Game Season 1 was a knockout. It grabbed us by the collar, threw us into twisted childhood games, and left us sweating and questioning capitalism... all while enjoying popcorn. The concept was fresh, bold, and full of memorable moments - from ""Red Light, Green Light"" to that unforgettable marbles episode. Easy 9/10.  But then came the sequels.  Season 2? Not bad at all. A few new angles, a bit more depth to the workers and the outside world. The mystery expanded nicely. Still interesting, still intense. But then Netflix said, ""Let's milk it,"" and Season 3 came charging in.  And that's where the magic started to fade.  Season 3 felt like a long goodbye that forgot to say anything new. The final games lacked the punch of earlier ones, and some of the plot twists were so predictable I half-expected them to come with a spoiler warning. And the VIPs? Let's just say their acting could win gold... at a school play.  The emotional beats tried hard, especially with Gi-hun's journey, but the ending didn't hit as hard as it should have. Instead of a satisfying finale, we got a quiet fizzle. And let's not even talk about that baby subplot - was that necessary?  Still, I can't deny the impact of the show as a whole. The acting (from the Korean cast), production, music, and social commentary remained strong. The themes of desperation, inequality, and survival were handled powerfully - especially in the first two seasons.  So overall? Squid Game remains a bold, gripping series worth watching. But maybe, just maybe, it should've quit the game while it was still winning.  Final Verdict: 8/10 - Still deadly good, just not quite game over gold."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"After the intense debates and split opinions of Season 2, the Plushie Crew stepped into Squid Game Season 3 with a cautious but undeniable spark of excitement. We knew by now that these deadly games aren't just about shocks-they're about peeling away layers, testing morality, and figuring out who's truly pulling the strings. This time, we thought we were ready... but the game still had surprises in store.  From the opening moments, the atmosphere felt heavier, the games sharper, and the moral dilemmas murkier than ever. Winny and Willow were immediately drawn in by the season's darker, more psychological tone, praising how the tension clung to even the quietest scenes. Mimikyu appreciated the tighter pacing compared to last season-though admitted a couple of slower beats still lingered.  Amy and Tails couldn't stop talking about the set and costume design, spotting even more clever uses of color and symbolism woven into the world. Kuromi found herself captivated by one of the new characters, calling them one of the show's most compelling additions yet. Shadow and Sonic, our resident plot tacticians, admired the balance between action and strategy, saying the arcs felt more complete this time around.  Knuckles and Sunny were thrilled that the games felt inventive again-some blindsided us completely, delivering both surprise mechanics and emotional punches. Our post-episode debates turned fiery, splitting the crew over which moves were brilliant gambits and which were hopeless missteps.  By the finale, we were left somewhere between satisfied and haunted. While not perfect, Squid Game Season 3 delivered a sharper, bolder experience than before, proving it still has the power to grip us and spark long, heated conversations.  The Plushie Crew gives it a solid 7/10 - tense, stylish, and unafraid to push its players to the brink. 🦑🎯🔴"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Creat cinematography. Excellent story line. Great acting!  Very interesting take on showing human nature and how twisted it is.  At first, I wasn't interested in watching it but after the first episode I was hooked. Amazed after every episode with how intricate this is entire concept is.  This series is full of big and small details which could be missed if not paying attention."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"Squid game doesn't deserve half the hype it's getting. As someone who's easily satisfied, the plot is totally off, the actions certain characters decide to make and the whole ""fictional realism"" is mediocre at best.  On the other hand, the visuals, colors and camerawork in general is amazing."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,1,,"Season 2 of Squid Game is a total letdown. What could have been wrapped up in one episode is dragged out endlessly, making it a chore to watch. Everything feels repetitive: the scenes are boring, the dialogue is pointless, and there's no real substance to keep you engaged. The charm, suspense, and emotional depth that made the first season a global phenomenon are completely missing here, replaced with uninspired storytelling and shallow character development that leaves you wondering why they even bothered.  Netflix has turned the show into a full-blown marketing circus. It's no longer about telling a compelling story but about squeezing every last penny out of the franchise. The series feels stuffed with forced connections, unnecessary subplots, and blatant product placements that add nothing to the narrative. It's like they're trying to sell you something in every scene, and it ruins any sense of immersion or authenticity.  The worst part is how disconnected and disjointed it all feels, as if Netflix is more focused on creating spin-offs and merchandising opportunities than delivering a solid second season. It's frustrating to watch such a lazy and obvious cash grab, especially when the first season set such a high standard. Honestly, don't waste your time on this mess. There are far better shows out there that actually respect their audience."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"The hype for this series is real. With incredible acting, and interesting dynamics and twists, I was on the edge of my seat almost all the time. The juxtaposition of children's games with horrifying themes was a great choice, and the overall design was top notch, especially the set design and costume design. Not only was it good looking it was memorable.  Lee Jung-jae's performance was top notch, as was the majority of the performance from all main and supporting characters. The only exception here is the VIP's who were unbearably bad. I'm not sure if it was the dialogue or something, but they were just bad in general. There was also one particular plot point that was a little too obvious from the beginning, but no spoilers.  It was all around one of the best shows I've seen. Great writing, acting, design, characters, cinematography, twisty plots, and more.  Production/Cinematography: 5/5 Acting/Characters: 4/5 Plot: 4.5/5 Writing: 5/5 Soundtrack: 4.5/5."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"This Korean drama shows up Hollywood in every way. By the third episode, the viewer is totally immersed in the characters' struggles, because this is just good writing. Each character is more and less than they appear to be. We have fascinating and necessary back stories, which make the action incredibly poignant. This is not, as many critics have claimed, a gory show. It's no more violent than something like Game of Thrones. Less so, as the main violence is people being dispatched by gunfire. I do think the last few episodes weren't as good as the first ones, but I suspect they're planning a follow-up season, so much was left unexplained. Great show that really explores human nature, both the good and the bad."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,I can't wait to forget about this show so I can watch it all over again. Yep the actors who played the VIPs sucked I just wanted to skip those parts and some other boring bits but you have to have them for the storyline but the games... I'm never giving anything away. I reacted out loud every time a game was revealed and yelled at the screen for them to choose something else even though I was wrong every single time. No one I know was willing to watch this show so it killed me to have no one to discuss it with. That's why I do these reviews.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"Ahhh, it's been months since I've seen the whole series BUT...so far...  We need more of these crazy and hilarious KOREAN FILMS  I love the ideas, drama, and overall clumsiness and chaos of it all. The execution and preciseness can always use some work but this film succeeded and surpassed it's goals; and that is, to entertain and make a huge profit!  Every person in America has likely heard about this dramatic television series especially now in the information age."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"Having watched Alice in Borderlands last year which was amazing I was excited about all the buzz about this show. It's entertaining, but the acting is sometimes cringey and other elements drag on like episode 2 when they all go back and decide to return to the game which could've been done in a 15 minute segment. It's fine as a show and entertainment but a stand out show or original it's not. Definitely a case in which social media and buzz has outdone the product."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Must Must must watch it, I finished it in just one day, i was glued with my chair whole day to finish last episode get predictable But it don't ruin your enjoyment. I heard about it from one of my friend and watched it and won't regret."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"I started to watch ss1 after ss2 was launching. And I must say the movie is not that impressive. The beginning was strong however the developments and some events that leaded to the end were not satisfied and smart enough. The arrangement of the games did not really express the aim - equality. After all I just could remember the violence and fight from all scenes. On the other hand, the acting is good with all characters express themselves very well. Maybe because I have watched a ton of survival movies like this, and with all the reputation I have heard about this one that made the experience fell short of my personal expectations. Watch season 2? Probably not."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Squid Games realises  That even closest ppl will ditch/kill , when they want to become billioner or go ahead from you in life/career .

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,5,,"While season one definitely had it's issues, namely pacing, plot contrivances and some poor acting, it made up for that with the games and the tension within them.  By continuing the plot and putting 2 of the main characters from season one into the games, there is no longer that feeling of uncertainty. Once the game begins, Season 2 mirrors Season 1 so much it feels copy/pasted to a degree. I knew beforehand how every scenario would play out. The voting between rounds was a massive waste of time and accomplished nothing. The attempts to make these votes seem epic and dramatic only further soured the experience.  Add to this that the pacing problems, juvenile dialogue and poor acting are made worse in Season 2 and what we're left with is a real stinker."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"I feel I'm quite hard to please when it comes to to shows and movies, but this was really really great to watch. Never wanted it to end The subtitles/dub don't match up so it's kind of take your pick what you want to translate it all as but it doesn't take anything away from the actual show."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"First off, if you are starting this show, please give it the respect it deserves and watch the original Korean version with the English subtitles. A lot of people can be incredibly lazy when it comes to foreign films/TV shows. Avoid the American dubbed version like the plague. Now, onto the shoe itself which was an absolute blast from start to finish. Believe the hype, it genuinely is that brilliant and the acting is on point. The characters are very well developed and you start to grow to like certain characters as the series unfolds. It's over the top violence and a little far fetched, but you are watching a TV series for entertainment, not to be educated. For all the 1* reviews. Ignore them. These are people that deliberately don't rate a show because it's popular and trend. Yes, it can be annoying when a show suddenly becomes huge and everyone jumps on the bandwagon, but don't let that put you off. It's one of the best series Netflix has produced in years. Highly recommended."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"While this is somehow entertaining, yet there are a lot of boring moments, especially, as stated in other reviews, the terrible acting by half of the total cast.  This show suffers of the repetitive design of many aspects, such as the costume, music, places, even the reaction of the actors.  Also, there is always a boring moment between the games, and that's while the games it self are not epic nor serious but some how they finish it with lots of blood and death..."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"I hate violence in movies but somehow could not stop watching this. The story is intriguing - a group of down-in-their-luck men and women were invited to play a series of kids' games that pitted their lives against each other for a prize of billions of wons. I couldn't help wondering whether millions of viewers all over the world also have the same question: if you are up to your neck in debt, would you join the game?  I guess the reason I kept watching this despite my aversion to violence is because the violence is necessary to show viewers the horrendousness of greed. It shows how evil love of money is, that one would be willing to die for it. This begs another question: how is this game different from the game millions of people play everyday, sacrificing their relationships, health, principles, dignity and self-respect for jobs and other sources of income?"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"A drama that works as a critique of wealth disparity, with hundreds of desperate people brought together on a mysterious island to compete for a big cash prize, not knowing what the games they are about to play will entail. When they do understand it, we see some of the inevitable behavior from a group of people under great stress, including violence towards one another amidst scattered bits of humanism. What kind of individual can survive in such a dog eat dog environment, and what does it do to them, the series has us ponder. Meanwhile, the elite sit back and enjoy the spectacle, having set up an ominous power structure of men behind masks to keep everyone in line, and to kill when necessary. It's clearly a metaphor for the human condition under extreme forms of capitalism.  There are lots of great characters here, starting with Lee Jung-jae, #456, the gambling addict who owes a lot of money and had his wife take their daughter and leave him for another man. O Yeong-su (#001, the elderly man), Park Hae-soo (#218, his childhood friend), and Heo Sung-tae (#101, the vicious gangster) all shine, and the series did a good job of letting us see their back stories. That's true of the female characters as well, who I really liked here, including Kim Joo-ryoung (#212, the wildly effusive con), HoYeon Jung (#067, the sullen North Korean defector), and Lee Yoo-mi (#240, who killed her abusive stepfather). The plot easily could have been too simple and linear, but through these characters and some of the subplots, like the illicit business set up by some of the guards to sell organs, it was able to keep itself larger than the sum of its (violent) parts.  I found that it also worked as a critique of voyeurism (including the viewer!), for while one may think of the barbarity of the Roman Colosseum while watching this as something distant from themself, one is inevitably drawn to the incredibly cruel games, wondering who will survive. I thought it might have been a teeny bit more effective had the VIP's not been present in the later episodes though, since their dialogue was so shlocky and it seems to me that a lot of ultra-powerful are often more hidden in the real world. I just imagined that a call at the end from the Front Man (the overseer) which alluded to him answering to others and a larger structure might have been more sinister and powerful. No matter though. This is an entertaining series on several levels, and kept those of us watching it guessing as to what would happen moment to moment. I hope the following seasons are able to keep up with fresh social commentary, and not devolve into the spectacle of the games."

But please, please, please- don't extend forever into series 6,7, 8...etc, etc, like some of the other substandard Hollywood shows that Netflix has commissioned before."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"To be honest, the first time I found out about ""Squid Game"" was when I was traveling home and a passenger on my bus was watching it on his cell phone. After doing some research to confirm, I tried to avoid spoilers until I could see it, but in less than 24 hours the entire internet was filled with it. That forced me to abstain from watching the series for a few days until the boom subsided.  After finally observing the 9 chapters, I can share the following points. Personally, I really liked the social message that the series shared, of how they gave Korean children's games of the 70s and 80s a dark twist, and the chemistry between the characters and their individual development. I would have easily given it an 8, if not for two downsides.  The first was the way the story was told. At first, it was able to take off without any problem but it became unstable until the end of the season, which in my opinion could have been better. Apart from that, the police side-plot must also have been developed better. They gave him considerable screening time, only to stop with a clichéd Star Wars-type moment? I mean, what the heck?  The second is related to the characters. Although the characters had good chemistry with each other and a good, but slow individual development, the same cannot be said about the audience; since they felt a bit generic and the charisma was almost non-existent (especially with the main character).  In short, ""The Squid Game"" is not a bad series, but I consider it highly overrated from what I had to see. If in such case Netflix renews it for a Season 2, it is necessary that improvements be made, especially with the writing part. I give it a 6.5/10."

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"Squid Game is a South Korean TV series released in streaming from 2021 to 2025, directed by Hwang Dong-Hyuk.  The series consists of three seasons and a total of 22 episodes and features ""Seoung Gi-Hun"" as the protagonist: a man with financial and gambling problems, a very sick mother, and a daughter.  Soon Gi-Hun, due to his gambling addiction, accumulated debts and the need for money for his mother's treatment, finds himself accepting the bizarre offer of a shady and convincing individual to participate in a ""Prize Game"", which will also turn out to be a deadly and sadistic game. Where hundreds of people in economic difficulty are offered a ""last"" chance to redeem themselves.  The series shows us the various phases of the ""game"" from the point of view (mainly) of Gi-Hun and many other characters, both participants in the game and the organizers.  The themes addressed are many: greed, gambling addiction, poverty, wealth, unbridled luxury, the cruelty of human beings and at the same time the ability to show oneself human even in the worst situations.  Squid Game is a very complete series, capable of transporting the viewer into a universe of madness, violence and cruelty, in search of good and hope in people. All enriched by excellent characters, plot twists, action, investigation, emotions and a beautiful soundtrack that will remain in your head for months.  Personally, I highly recommend watching Squid Game, both to lovers of Korean cinema and to everyone else. In particular, I think the first season is the best, excellent from many points of view.  I must instead give some demerits to the second and third seasons. Overall, the series remains enjoyable, but there is an undeniable decline from all points of view. The characters lose character and depth, the soundtrack does not hold up to the comparison with the first season, everything seems more hasty and not very in-depth. I find some plot choices forced and not very shareable, and, especially in the third season they try to make the viewer cry a bit forcedly.  Having said that I think Squid Game is a series that overall deserves a 7/10, but that could have been managed better in seasons 2 and especially 3."

No obvious message from the rich elite in Hollywood. No forced identity (with the exception of the elite watching the fights (poor acting, the sole downside of the movie) but real identities (e.g. Different characters).  No all-powerful protagonists. Not total conformism. When a girl or woman fights a man it's believable and no preaching. I love it. No endless preaching from the hypocrites (which constantly pulls you out of the movie experience) but good 'le inventive and exciting entertainment.

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"Squid Game 2 dares to break free from the formulaic conventions of modern television storytelling, delivering a refreshingly bold narrative that challenges the status quo. While much of contemporary TV has embraced cinematic visuals but often falters in delivering substance, Squid Game 2 sets itself apart by refusing to rely on fluff. It not only revisits the complex characters fans grew attached to in the first installment but also expands their world with fresh ambition, crafting a story that feels both original and deeply rooted in the series' ethos.  The seven-episode structure is methodical and deliberate. Remarkably, the games that define the Squid Game universe don't even commence until the third episode, a decision that feels as daring as it is rewarding. By taking the time to reorient viewers to the emotional and psychological stakes of the series, the showrunners ensure that when the games finally arrive, they carry immense weight. This slower build is reminiscent of The Empire Strikes Back-a masterclass in world-building that leans on character development, tension, and cliffhanger endings to deliver a deeply immersive experience.  That said, this risk-taking approach isn't without its flaws. Episode 5, in particular, becomes an awkward stumbling block in an otherwise tight narrative. This is where we are fully introduced to a new trans character. While the inclusion of such a character is commendable on paper, the execution feels forced and arbitrary. A bathroom scene, where female characters decide to step away for seemingly no reason other than to facilitate a moment of acceptance for the trans character, feels unnecessary and breaks the narrative flow. It's a bold cultural statement, but one that adds little to the overall story.  Later in the same episode, the trans character's backstory is explored in detail. As a high-ranking soldier who was forced out of the military upon coming out as trans, they join the games with the dream of winning enough money for surgery in Thailand. While this is an intriguing setup, the handling of the character feels contrived, with their motivations and backstory introduced so late in the series that it doesn't feel fully earned. Instead of being a nuanced addition, the storyline becomes a distraction from the larger narrative.  By the time the final episode arrives, Squid Game 2 shifts into high gear, racing to tie up loose ends while setting the stage for future installments. The decision to end on a cliffhanger, much like The Empire Strikes Back, is bold but divisive, leaving many viewers with a sense of frustration. The deliberate pacing and rich storytelling of the earlier episodes make the rushed conclusion feel jarring.  Despite these missteps, Squid Game 2 succeeds in creating a gripping, original tale that captures the essence of the series while daring to take risks. Its flaws may be noticeable, but its ambition is undeniable. For fans of the original, Squid Game 2 offers a thrilling, if imperfect, return to a world that continues to captivate."

Honestly, I lost touch with characters due to bad writing. Even Gi-hun felt like some random character in initial episodes of the finale. Though, the ending of his arc was satisfactory.  7. The pacing was really erratic. Some things were rushed and the others were dragged too much. Could've slept through the entire thing.  8. Sometimes, less is more. And Squid Games was one of those series which should have known where to tap out.  In short, season 3 had plenty of potential and a great concept but it was executed horribly.

You have characters acting super goofy at times and then super serious at other times.. like, not on a real world scale but a comical scale.. it's like watching Jim Carrey switch from Ace Ventura to Keanu Reeves' John Wick (in the beginning of the first one).. how are you gonna have a goofy nerd making absurd faces and dancing around like and idiot some badass later on? It makes no sense.. certainly have never witnessed this in any human behavior I've ever seen. It's like they wrote the part for 4 very different people and then combined it into one.. I give it points for originality but I hated the characters. They all could have died and it would have probably turned out better."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"This k-horror is a must see. Lots of blood and death this tale is not for those with weak stomachs. But this tale delivers more than just shock value. It's a commentary on high stakes gambling where there is no risk greater than death. Children's games harken innocence while greed and sacrifice decide each players fate. The ""VIP's"" are the weakest link, depicted as caricatures of selfish rapacious greed; but even with their one dimensionality there is a lot of social commentary to consider."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,,,"When I first watched squid game, my standards weren't that high. However, it exceeded my standards and is up there with my top 3 favourite TV shows.  I thoroughly enjoyed the plot and the interesting concept. The games were well designed and intense to watch and SOME characters you can relate with.  I think Squid Game is probably near to as good as the Saw franchise.  If you like Saw and survival movies, you should definitely watch, you won't regret it."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"Man! This show!  Does everything right at the best times. Just when you forget some detail that would make you feel brilliantly smart, it comes back to whack you in the face!

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"Season one gave viewers a full story arc. Season two ended in the middle of that story arc. Absolutely zero story lines resolved. This makes the end of season 2 feel more like a mid-season cliff-hanger a la LOST than a complete season of a show. Highly disappointing.  Everything else about season 2 added and built upon season one. New characters were introduced and played poignantly and expertly by the actors. The individual character arcs were told well, and of course the games were as exciting and entertaining to watch as always.  As the tension of the season continues to build, the story seems to be building to something that will resolve a heck of a lot of tension. What viewers were given instead was a serious let down. I don't know what the reasoning was for the season ending abruptly the way it did, but I don't know if I will want to watch more if it's going to be treated this recklessly in the future. I'm reminded of the season 6 finale of The Walking Dead..."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,RECOMMENDED. Finished this in one night. I cant stop watching it. Worth every episodes.

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,1,,"The symbolism behind this show is representative of The Dangerous Game and Eyes Wide Shut. Satanic billionaires that run all our world institutions bored with all they have desperate to feel any kind of emotion, which apparently comes from dehumanizing the masses and defiling the innocent.  Those that find enjoyment are already lost to degeneracy. You are subconsciously being conditioned to accept this as normal. Pay attention.

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"Squid Game Season 1 became hugely popular due to the entertaining value of games themselves, but I highly value its provocation.  I just watched Season 2, and the show keeps asking the audience: what choice would you make? The main argument between Front Man (representing the Game) and Gi-hoon is whether the participation in the Game is by choice or not. Front Man argues that the Game is 100% voluntary since people sign up to participate. Some players, even when they learned about the risk of playing the Game and had a chance to leave the game, chose not to leave.  But nothing exists out of context in reality. Players decide to join the game because they are stuck in serious troubles, often a large amount of debt. Debt is not the only issues in their lives. Usually certain misfortune in a person's life puts them in debt: addiction, gambling, fraud, failure of business, hospital bills, etc. Debt is only added to these issues, followed by violent loan sharks.  When a person has to choose between continuing to endure an extremely painful life and risking life to end the pain, can we call it a 'choice'? If so, isn't our society too harsh on so many people who have similar lives to those of the players in Squid Game?  By presenting an exaggerated situation, Squid Game makes us face the reality that many people live among us and around us. Following the empathetic and righteous Gi-hoon's steps, we get to ask ourselves, ""what would I have done if I were in his shoes?""  + production design, camera work, acting are all fabulous!"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"The Squid game is probably one of the best shows I have seen in a long long time. It sure knows how to play around with the viewer's emotions. It will make you fall in love with some of the characters and then break your heart by killing them off in creative ways.  Its a tough show to watch simply because you will be fully invested and immersed well enough into the story for it to make an impact on you.  Great Character development - Check Perfect Casting - Check Perfect screenplay and progression - Check   A brilliant show that is a must watch, that will make you root for the characters, cry for them and generally start to question their morality, motivations and choices.  And that's what the show is all about. The ethical choices we have to make just to be selfish, just to survive one more day in this cruel cruel world.  I will not give away the plot but would instead implore you to watch the show by yourself and form your own opinions."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,Entertaining and demonstrating human nature via this drama. My conclusion is not to be poor otherwise become a chess from rich.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,3,,Season 1 is good but S2 is boring. Wouldn't recommend. Not worth the wait. Unnecessary drama and only 3 games.  Even tho acting and cinematography is good But story gets pulled like a chewing gym with nothing unique or amazing to keep hooked.  The story is nor as exiciting as 1st season Netflix just threw money to creators for new season I don't think the creators actually wanted to do this. I had to fast forward many times because the pace was slow and nothing new adding up.  I wish they took more time to make but made a better show.  Episode 3 and 4 are good. Watch 8th show or alice in wonderland instead.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Squid Game has a very high body count, and lots of gore to go with it. But even while the blood is spattering, the focus is on the characters, their relationships with each other, and the mysteries they're unraveling. The attention to detail in every aspect of the series elevates it from enjoyable and entertaining to truly exceptional.  The sets in the Game are mostly simple, with a childish surreality. Yet also artfully designed for the impact that they have, and exquisitely memorable.  Usually when the acting is good, we don't notice or think about it. But there were several times that actors displayed their emotions which such perfectly controlled subtlety that you have to stop to admire it: the uncontrollably trembling chin of an actor pushing himself to the edge of tears to do honor to the scene, or an actor's blank face with the character's emotions ""betrayed"" by only the twitching of one eye.  Needless to say, the directing and production must have also been top-notch to create these scenes and put them together to tell such a simple but compelling story. The emotional impact is also carefully crafted: somehow, in the midst a huge number of violent deaths, the audience is left sobbing for half of an episode as both developed and undeveloped characters face impending death.  And ultimately, there is a fairly clear moral to the story. But that will have more impact if it's seen and felt, instead of described here."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"I am at the 3rd episode in a row! This is really entertaining in a good manner of modern Korean mystery dramas. Well done, usually I am quite skeptical about Netflix shows but this one is truly good one. Enjoy!"

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,I don't know what to say except this series is perfection. It's original and it draws you in if you give it a chance.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"So Season 1 was great because the series brought new vibe into Netflix Originals and the main idea of the series is so good, it contains so much potential to be a top tier show. Sadly the world building and the staging started on top level but kept getting worse every single Episode.  The main plot(twist) from last Episode in case was good but they formed it a little bit predictable in my opinion (either because of their exaggerated or too transparent portrayal/focus on individual characters).  Second Season started very good, because some characters have the same level of knowledge as we do and we can empathize better. Again sadly it is to say that it got way faster worse than the first season. The plots are to predictable and the adaptation of the lore through recurring characters is simply too boring.  I am unfortunately disappointed and therefore my personal reviews/ratings of Squid Game are as follows:  Season 1 : 6.3/10 Season 2 : 4.1/10  Overall: 5.1/10."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Squid Game started as a gut punch. Its first season shocked audiences with an explosive mix of violence, social critique, and characters as extreme as they were relatable. Beyond the morbid appeal of deadly trials, what really gripped viewers was how it spoke of debt, desperation, and humanity. It wasn't just entertainment; it was a wake-up call disguised as a spectacle.  Season two chose to expand the universe, introducing new settings and more layers around the system behind the games. It lost some of the surprise factor, sure, but made up for it with a more ambitious plot and even more elaborate visuals. Some narrative decisions were debatable, but the show remained addictive, unsettling, and at times, brilliant.  The third season brought a powerful close. It was rawer, more introspective, and unafraid to make viewers uncomfortable. While some felt the freshness had faded, this final act managed to land with intelligence and an even darker view of human nature. The writing dove deep into the psychology of the characters, without holding back.  What makes Squid Game remarkable is that even in its weaker moments, it maintains a consistent tone and message. The violence isn't gratuitous-it's brutal, yes, but always purposeful. The aesthetics serve the narrative. Every shot, uniform, and silence carries meaning. That consistency is one of the show's greatest strengths.  As a trilogy, it works. Not every part hits the same, but together, the show holds weight, a clear voice, and a message that stings. Watching the full arc, you begin to understand what the creator meant all along: that the game isn't fiction, but a painfully close metaphor.  In short, Squid Game hasn't just been a global hit-it's one of the boldest, most coherent, and provocative series television has seen in years. The initial shock may not return, but the aftertaste it leaves is lasting, uncomfortable, and hard to shake."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"Squid Game's first season is a brilliant, must-see phenomenon. Unfortunately, the subsequent seasons are a masterclass in how to squander potential with some of the worst writing on television.  The plot devolves into lazy clichés; any locked door or complex mechanism is conveniently overcome by shooting it. Character intelligence plummets, especially in fights where a victor will injure their foe, then inexplicably drop their weapon and turn their back. It shatters all tension.  The cast does their best, but even great acting can't save a script that makes its characters this foolish. A huge letdown."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,I've never watched a Korean tv show before but decided to give this a try since it looked very intriguing and it definitely did not disappoint! It's got an interesting story plus some crazy and gory themes. I highly enjoyed it from start to finish!
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"Season 2 is brilliant and so much better than season 1, the acting is much better.  I was blown away when I first started watching this, but as the series went on it got a bit tedious, and some of the acting was terrible, especially from the woman who had the lighter, she almost made me want to abandon the whole series.  There is some good acting though, and the idea of the series is very good and interesting.  I'd like this to be re-made by the Americans, I think it would definitely be interesting."

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"The problem with a mini series that starts out as good as this one is, it's really hard to keep the same intensity for eight more episodes. The first episode is arguably the most intense and shocking 55 minutes ever filmed. So there's bound to be a drop off. Even so, the entire series is extremely watchable and even binge worthy. If you're looking for something different... THIS IS IT !!"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"Story Line of season 2 was moving with very slow pace and most of the part of series was expected, also the ending it very vague, At least it should have been ended with come conclusion but the story line is completely open for third season.  The story could have been ended it some concluding way but letting just a small window open for third season but it seems to be opened on all fronts. Also during the games being played and after the game the story was bit boring and was being tuned on a expected line which forced me to fast forward the scenes and same discussion being happening after every game."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"I want to dedicate this review just for episode 6 which involves a marble game.  Episode 6 is the greatest piece of emotional rollercoaster i have ever watched. This episode is depressing, shocking, tender, furious, helpless, funny, intelligent and cunning. Unbelievably good and sick!  Just this episode alone deserves an award for the team.  Overall, it's a great series even though personally i didn't like the last 2 episodes."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"I came into this with high hopes being a fan of Korean and Asian cinema and was not disappointed. I wouldn't honestly put this up there with Train To Busan - it had the same level of character development - you genuinely care what happens to these characters. It also has a battle royale meets would you rather meets hostel vibe. Just don't watch it dubbed, stick with the original Korean and subtitles."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,5,,"Season 1 was about an 8/10. This season delivered solid storytelling, great and interesting characters, and had memorable visuals, and emotional depth. It introduced iconic moments like ""Red Light, Green Light"" and the dalgona candy game, which quickly became viral sensations online. Overall, it was a creative and impactful start that set a high bar for the series.  Season 2 was about a 5/10. This season had a few decent moments and some continuation of the original thrill, but it lacked the intensity and emotional weight of season one. While the games were still somewhat interesting, the storytelling felt inconsistent, and the overuse of awkward or ill-fitting background music made many scenes feel forced or cringeworthy.  Season 3 was about a 3/10, Aside from the hide-and-seek episode, which stood out as a rare highlight, the rest of the season felt rushed and poorly executed. The same background music as season 2 was added which made the scenes awful, and distracting, the VIPs was horrible, and the plot was filled with unrealistic elements, and the overall story arc felt lazy, like an uninspired attempt to wrap up the series. By the end, it felt like a waste of time compared to the potential shown in season one.  To end this off I would suggest to watch all of Season 1 and then not bother watching the other Seasons."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"It's like. Season 1 was the best season. Okay, we move on to Season 2. Ehh it's alright. I think Season 2 served as build up for season 3. Which, is the second best season. Season 3 is the season where the writers really put everything in it. Where season 2 fell was that, it lacked climax. Nothing felt scary, we knew everyone was going to live, it lacked the Squid Game of it. But season 3 wow. I haven't felt this invested in Squid Game since 2021! It's amazing. Everything is done well, the suspense. The feeling of not knowing who's going to die. It's all just. Perfect. Perfect. Season 3 is amazing!"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"Squid Game isn't easy viewing at all; and I believe that it was meant to make viewers uncomfortable and distressing as all hell, because that's what desperation with life-and-death situations are truly like, and it can actually break who we are as people.  456 players, 45.6 billion South Korean won, six games, and only ONE player can come out as the grand champion after everyone else has been killed. To make matters even worse these people were kidnapped off the streets because of their debts to collectors, yet outside the world is far more unforgiving than the brutal takes on classic kid's games.  Netflix managed to strike gold with this show, which I guess took off because of the pandemic's devastating effects on ALL of society, and the themes of desperation and survival resonated with anyone and everyone who tuned into this breakaway mega-hit. It got people so invested it became a massive meme, where people parodied the thing, cooked up fan-theories and mocking the show's all-English dub.  In spite of the showy production values in Squid Game, the characters are still very much like real people who've got real frustrations, real tension inside them, and very real everyone-for-themselves urgency to their character arcs. Squid Game is still a grounded story in spite of its SELECT sci-fi/spy-fi trappings and comic-book-like iconography with the 'PlayStation Men' and mysterious leader.  Squid Game is Netflix's unexpected phenomenon; and I reckon there'll be those who understand and appreciate it and those who won't.  Memes or no memes, this is a show definitely worth your time."

Ending was also pretty interesting, although a bit predictable.  Overall, i enjoyed ""Squid Game"". It felt fresh and was involving as well being believable throughout. I believe that given its popularity it will get more seasons. As long as they will be solid as the first one, I'm in for this show."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"People are overestimating this series in a way never seen before, it's just an average series, basically this series takes several movies and series and mixes them all together, the only game that's really interesting to watch is the first one."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"I found Squid Game a hard show to put down. Once you immerse yourself within this show it feels all too real and scary. I find dark shows more engrossing perhaps because they seem realistic and possible. Human nature has a dark and sometimes unforgiving side. This is why shows like Squid game and Black Mirror trend compared to very PG and convenient shows where the good guys always win.  Another thing to celebrate here is diversity and globalisation. Squid game, being a Korean show which is set in Korea with Korean actors has broken viewing records. The power of Netflix, through its streaming, has crossed international boundaries and reached so many people. We didn't need to see big Hollywood names or familiar settings in New York or LA. Korea and its brand of actors delivered a great show. Borders in a sense have been broken, coincidentally in a time when a virus physically forces them to close.  This show was thought provoking and makes you ask really think about life in general. We're all trying to get rich. But being rich doesn't buy happiness nor does it buy you health."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"It has great suspenful moment and with decent to good character development. Due to this, a lot of the character death are painful to watch.

It is extreme in every human nature they portrayed like when they want to show you hate , friendship, trust , action, backstabbing every emotion is of very extreme kind. It also teaches us that money is not everything. Those who have money and those who don't are sad in one way or the other & We should help others no matter what. I will give it 10 out 10. All hail to Korea for this treat. Love from India 🇮🇳"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Sorry. That's a crude summation of this brilliant series. It's a brutal, tense satire on the economic systems we are all trapped in. Would those who lose most at the game, who gamble and get into debt far beyond what they can repay as wage slaves, would they risk their lives to be free? Of course; they would play the Squid Game.  Motivations and characters are carefully fleshed out. The concept of the games we play as children having life & death consequences in adult life is intelligently, deviously developed. It combines quality, international art house drama style with thrills & bloody horror. If you're ready for something challenging and intense play the Squid Game."

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,It had good moments till vip episode but overall games sucked and too childish and then the ending and last few episodes sucked..........................
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"Squid game was made not for entretainment but to spread a message about society.  This show shows how capitalism manufactures desperation as a condition for its survival. It reveals that people aren't inherently greedy or violent; they're forced into a blood sport when society denies them basic necessities like dignity, housing, and healthcare unless they ""earn it."" Also, needless to say, it critiques the system and how it affects people from different economic situations, those suffering under poverty, debt and humiliation are treated as inferior to the rich, who end up gambling with them.  Season 1 of Squid Game is, without a doubt, one of the greatest series of all time. When it was released, it was revolutionary; cinematographically and artistically amazing. One of its biggest strengths was its original concept, something never seen before. Thanks to the excellent writing, which is the pilar of the show, the characters felt human and believable, each representing different struggles within society. The pacing was perfect, with thrilling mystery at its heart, and importantly, it avoided clichés and never lost its essence. The striking production design gave the show a unique personality, something rare today and still iconic. But what stood out the most was its powerful social commentary.  Because Season 1 set the bar so high, Season 2 had a tough job, and it managed to reach those standards quite well. Season 2 introduced new characters who became the core of the story. It also gave fans an inside look at the games, which was fun but sometimes made the original mystery feel faded. The season respected the legacy, but there were still things to criticize. Unlike the strong finale of Season 1, Season 2 ended with a disappointing cliffhanger. Visually, the finale was impressive, but emotionally it lacked the shocking impact and moral depth that made the first season unforgettable. Instead of a bold ending, it felt more like a setup for the next season. This finale also started a violent, chaotic trend that led to the catastrophic third season.  Season 3 is, by far, the worst of all. The show seems to have lost its purpose. The waste of some characters is frustrating, and others act in ways that feel dumb, meaningless, and hard to relate to. The police subplot, which was supposed to be important, turns out useless. The season feels rushed and tries to create a meaningful and impactful story but ends up doing the opposite. The writing quality has dropped, and ironically, the whole team seems blinded by money and greed.  Season 3 reveals almost nothing new about the mysterious organization or the games. Instead of fresh secrets or deepening the story, it repeats old conflicts and recycles familiar plots. This lack of new information makes the season feel stagnant and repetitive, leaving fans frustrated and disappointed. Without real surprises or bold twists, the suspense and excitement that once defined the series fade away.  And the finale? It really makes my blood boil. The return of the leader and his brother, plus the police storyline, was wasted. The baby subplot is horrible - they spent too much money on that instead of improving other parts. Words can't describe how depressing the last game is. By that point, the show had lost all its original essence.  Squid Game started as a groundbreaking and unforgettable series, setting high standards in storytelling, design, and social commentary. But as the seasons progressed, it lost its way. Season 2 struggled to maintain the mystery and emotional power, while Season 3 sacrificed quality and meaning for shock value and recycled ideas. Player 456 will remain one of the bests in history, and all the memes, iconic things and whatever won't be forgotten, I've had the time of my life laughing in a tik tok comment section. Once again the iconicness of a show impacts its quality.  But sadly,in the end, a once brilliant show faded into a shadow of its former self, leaving fans disappointed and longing for the fresh, original spark that made it great, because, again, ironically money always wins."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"This is one of my best short series of all time, it is so attaching and make you wanna finish it in one day, yes it is so violent and scenes might really disturb you, but.... I love it."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"Season 3 isn't just a continuation-it's a reset button and a revenge plan in motion. And I have to admit: I was skeptical. Season 2 left me with more questions than satisfaction, but Season 3? It's bolder. Darker. Smarter. And it brings back what I loved in Season 1-the human stakes.  This isn't just about surviving anymore. It's about fighting back.  ✅ What I Loved in Season 3  1. Gi-hun's new arc feels earned This is no longer the same man who barely made it out. He's laser-focused and walking the razor's edge between justice and obsession. The choices he makes now are uncomfortable-and that's exactly why I was hooked.  ""To kill the game, I might have to become the game.""  2. A deeper look into the system We finally get more of the hierarchy: the Inner Circle, the legacy of the Front Man, and the sick logic behind the entire operation. Season 3 doesn't just show the games-it shows how they're built. And who benefits.  3. The new games are twisted in the best way Let's just say: they got even more sadistic with simplicity. One involves truth-telling in a way that breaks people mentally before the game even starts. Another is a twist on trust-falls that had me yelling ""NO WAY"" at the screen.  4. High emotional impact returns Season 3 brought back the heartbreak of Season 1. There's a marble-level moment again. And yeah... it hit. Hard. I didn't expect to cry, and then I did. Again.  ❌ What Didn't Work for Me  1. Pacing still stutters mid-season Episodes 4 and 5 drag. It tries to get philosophical and loses some momentum. I respect it, but I felt the slowdown.  2. A few new characters felt underdeveloped There's one female player who seems crucial early on-then fades. It's like they forgot to give her a third act. That annoyed me.  3. The twist villain was a little too obvious I saw it coming three episodes ahead. Not that it ruined it-but I was hoping for a gut-punch surprise.  🌟 Final Thoughts  8.7 out of 10 Squid Game: Season 3 feels like the series finding itself again-gritty, strategic, and emotionally brutal. It answers a lot. It dares to ask more. And by the finale, I felt both shaken and satisfied. If Season 1 was survival, and Season 2 was fallout, then Season 3 is the counterattack we've been waiting for.  It's not perfect-but it's back.  🎥 If You Liked This, You Might Also Enjoy: 1. Alice in Borderland - Season 2 (Netflix) - Strategic survival with high stakes  2. Black Mirror: ""White Bear"" - Morality and punishment twisted into a game  3. The Platform (2019) - Brutal social allegory with life-and-death decisions  4. 3% - Season 3 (Netflix) - More rebellion, more layers  5. The Purge: The Series - Power, control, and the illusion of freedom."

It kinda does work but it makes you feel manipulated at the same time.  This is not a bad show and I can see why people like it. It has all parts to a great Netflix Original but I just felt manipulated while watching it.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,4,,"Episode 1 was AMAZING!!!  But things went downhill a little bit each episode. By episode 4, I was totally over it.  I did watch all 9 episodes, because I'd already invested so much time into it. Plus, I wanted to see what all the social media hype was about...unfortunately, after all 9 episodes, I'm not seeing it.  Didn't really need to be 9 hours long...would of worked better as one regular 90-minute film."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"With a premise similar to the likes of Cube and Circle, the odd titled Squid Game helps us question humanity all over again as well as the importance society places on money.  As dark and violent as Battle Royal and intriguing as 3% it grabs your attention early on and keeps you guessing to the end.  Great binge worthy series with a likeable cast and main protagonist.  Knocked off one point as I didn't love the ending but otherwise a really great TV series with some great ideas and worthy of top marks.  Season 2? Personally I think it works better as a one off but then again..."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"Honestly, Squid Game was one of the best shows I've ever seen, every detail has a deep reason, and it shows something that the director is trying to tell the audience. It represents a real-life story, not just some fake where it knows that the audience will like. By the end, you will not just have felt like you had a good time, you will have changed and become a better person. Despite what some people have said about the show being overrated, since they didn't get their desired ending. I think the show is great as it is. The series is a form of communication to explore and communicate the ideas of the director and people should try to understand that. The only bad thing to say is that the VIPs are bad. They don't have any character, and their lines aren't delivered with any actual thought and seem empty."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"The first season of Squid Game is 9/10, it was groundbreaking, gripping, and close to perfection. Each episode delivered shocking twists, defied expectations, and kept viewers hooked from beginning to end.  While the second season didn't quite reach the heights of the first, I still found it compelling and fitting for the direction the series was taking. The characters were developed with care, though I personally found Kang No-eul's character less engaging than the rest (same for season 3).  Season three, however, was a noticeable step back. Apart from the game sequences, the season largely felt disappointing. The storyline moved at a much slower pace compared to previous seasons, lacking the dark humor and ""tragicomic"" moments that had become a signature of the show. It leaned heavily into drama, which made it feel tonally different and somewhat unbalanced.  One of the most puzzling decisions was sidelining Seong Gi-hun. His role felt unusually passive, with limited dialogue and scarce screen time until the very last episode. The other main storyline was serviceable but also predictable. On a positive note, I think Front Man's transformation was handled effectively. However, the show seemed to go overboard in trying to portray the VIP characters as ridiculous or evil, it came off as forced and sometimes outright absurd.  As for the finale, it offered closure by completing the character arcs of both Seong Gi-hun and the Front Man. Although satisfying in a broad sense, the ending felt a bit too simple for a series of this scale and ambition. It could have benefited from a more daring or thought-provoking conclusion."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,I binge-watched this one. Every episode was so addictive and tense.  All episodes were very emotionnal. Then we reached the conclusion and.... what a letdown. Huge anti-climatic ending.  I would still recommend watching it.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"The sereal started very interesting. You dont know why happening this, who is behind this, and what kind of child game thay will play. But after episode 7 when the vip-s arrived, the whole concept are turnd up side down. All the serial become predictible, like im feeling my self as a precog. Who is the vip-s, who is the firshand whatever. That makes from 8 star to 7. But is still a good seral. A new type of battle royale. But the most annoying thing is, the concept was the child games, and that is gone when the vip-s was arrived. Why this concept changed? That was the moment when i changed my mind ftom 7 to 6 star. And of course the vip-s are super lame, but the concept change are way more worst than bad acting."

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"Season 2 Review -  One of the biggest global releases of this year, the anticipation for the new season was at an all-time high. It is a Herculean task to match the monumental expectations of fans, and thus, this season falls short compared to the previous one.  This season focuses on Gi-Hun, who, after winning 45.6 billion, returns to the game-not to win, but to put an end to it. His mission is to eliminate those orchestrating the games, exploiting vulnerable people on the brink of suicide due to their debts or financial struggles for their own twisted entertainment.  The season starts strong, picking up exactly where the previous one left off, with a promising storyline to take forward. The first two episodes set up the premise well, building anticipation for adrenaline-pumping games. However, that's where the disappointment sets in. This time, there are two new games, one of which includes five smaller games. Unfortunately, none of these matches the thrill or intensity of last season's challenges, leaving fans underwhelmed.  Lee Jung-jae, as the lead, continues to showcase his acting prowess. This season, his transformation into a more confident individual is portrayed convincingly. Lee Byung-hun, who was behind the mask last season, gets more screen time and delivers a commendable performance. Yang Mal-bok, a new character playing a mother in the game, elevates the series' emotional quotient. Additionally, other new characters, including T. O. P and Lee David, play their respective parts well.  The makers introduce interesting characters with solid characterizations, but their contributions to the narrative feel lacking. With so many new faces, the storyline becomes confusing, and the focus on characters plotting or seeking revenge takes away from the thrill and excitement of the games.  The season's ending is its biggest letdown-abrupt, as if someone turned off the screen mid-story. Neither the plot nor the games conclude satisfactorily, leaving viewers with more questions and, ultimately, frustration. While it sets the stage for another season, the unresolved storylines and lack of closure can feel irritating after investing so much time.  Watch this season if you're a fan of the series, but be prepared for a bit of disappointment as it doesn't measure up to the brilliance of Season 1.  #PranuReviews #SquidGames2 #SquidGames2Review #SquidGamesSeason2 #SquidGamesSeason2Review."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"First off the main character is unlikeable. I wasn't rooting for him the entire show. He's not exactly a good person and came off as annoying.  Second, it took a LONG TIME for anything interesting to happen. The establishing backstory was very boring and very unnecessary. They could have told us everyone's stories in a couple of quick flashbacks and gone straight into the action!  Third, this is not an original concept. I've seen this type of social commentary done a thousand times in a thousand different ways.  Do yourself a favor and go watch Alice in Borderland. It's a much better show."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,1,,"The second season of this series is an absolute letdown and feels like a blatant scam aimed at milking viewers for their time and money. From start to finish, it's clear that the creators had no solid plan or meaningful content to deliver. Instead, they resorted to stretching out episodes with filler material, dragging out scenes, and splitting games across multiple episodes just to pad the runtime. The entire season feels like a pointless slog, with no real progression or payoff. It's as if the writers were just winging it, pulling ideas out of thin air without any thought for coherence or entertainment value.  The games themselves are either repetitive or downright weak, lacking the creativity and intensity that made the first season engaging. One particular game was so poorly designed and nonsensical that it seemed solely intended to waste screen time and eliminate as many characters as possible. It was a lazy attempt to create drama without putting in the effort to craft something compelling. The season's pacing is atrocious, with most episodes feeling like a chore to sit through. Instead of building tension or developing characters, the show meanders aimlessly, leaving viewers frustrated and bored.  To make matters worse, the season ends on a cliffhanger, with the resolution of the central game pushed to the third season. This decision feels like a cheap trick to force viewers to keep watching, rather than a natural storytelling choice. It's clear that the creators are more interested in prolonging the series than delivering a satisfying narrative. Overall, the second season is a massive disappointment, filled with filler, weak content, and a lack of respect for the audience's time. It's a prime example of how to ruin a promising show by prioritizing profit over quality. Save yourself the frustration and skip this season entirely."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,I really enjoyed it and suggest this series to everyone I know! Perfect.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Squid Game is a savage yet gripping commentary on human nature, survival, and the cost of desperation in a world ruled by systemic inequality. The show doesn't hold back in its portrayal of how far people are willing to go to escape financial ruin and the moral compromises they make along the way.  What struck me the most was how the games stripped away layers of social pretense, exposing raw instincts-both noble and vile. While some characters clung to fragments of humanity, others succumbed to their darkest impulses, reminding me of how power and greed can distort even the kindest souls. The juxtaposition of the innocent childhood games with the horrifying stakes was as unsettling as it was genius, hammering home the twisted nature of the system.  But the series also explores the concept of choice-or the illusion of it. The players chose to return, but did they ever truly have a choice? The game mirrored the world outside: brutal, competitive, and indifferent to morality.  As a fan of psychological thrillers, Squid Game ticked all the boxes, but it also left me reflecting on how complicit we all are in systems that perpetuate inequality. While watching, I couldn't help but think about the parallels between this fictional world and our reality. Perhaps the most haunting part isn't the violence but how relatable the desperation feels.  This show sticks with you, forcing you to question not just the characters' choices but your own values as well.  Visually, the series is a feast for the eyes and fun in design. The bold use of color-the eerie pinks, greens, and reds-contrasts sharply with the dark themes, creating a surreal yet unnervingly playful aesthetic. The creativity in the set design, from the Escher-inspired staircases to the childlike yet menacing playgrounds, adds a layer of sophistication that mirrors the show's underlying commentary on manipulation and control. Even the costumes-iconic and unsettling in their simplicity-are meticulously crafted to convey power dynamics."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"I saw that some people rated Squid Game Season 2 a 1, while giving 5 or 6 stars to many Hollywood shows that are honestly trash. It seems to me that this stems from excessive dissatisfaction with the fact that the season was split into two parts, and that we have to wait until next year to see Season 3. Giving such low ratings just because things don't go exactly the way you want feels a bit childish. While Season 2 might not be as groundbreaking as Season 1, I think it's still enjoyable as a necessary step toward Season 3. It's tough to wait for the next season, but I believe Season 2 gives us plenty to speculate about how the story will conclude. There are tons of hidden clues in this season that set up what's to come, and I hope you all enjoy the fun of discovering them."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"Probably one of the most cliché, ""battle royale"" kind of storyline... BUT... It was still very gripping, intense, and entertaining. Definitely a binge worthy show! I can really see the typical K-drama elements in this show - you know, the unnecessary and far-fetched plot twist that almost makes you feel like it's trying to make up for something? Yeah, that. I could probably list all the cliché and predictable moments in this show but I don't want to spoil it for anyone.  However, I can't deny the fact that this really did get me binge watching for 2 days. Perhaps, it's the great acting or the overly indulgent storyline - I'm not sure but I was hooked."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Netflix has a habit of delivering seasons in two parts; they should have done the same here to avoid any confusion.  Nevertheless, S2 is still a brilliant and worthy continuation of S1. Does it hit the same? Nope, but this is next to impossible to achieve anyway. It picks up where S1 left off and expands our world. Now we see what happens in the control room, we see what happens outside the island, we even get a front-row seat of the Front Man.  S2 is packed with plot twists that had me gaping. The characters are relatable and interesting. Seong Gi-hun gets much-needed character depth. Lee Byung-hun is amazing as Front Man.  The new games could have been a bit more interesting, but if you are mad about that, you are missing the point - the whole aim of these games is to break the MC, Seong Gi-hun. They do not need to be creative, they need to be violent. The voting has the same purpose, to show Seong his side will always lose.  Honestly, the mad reviewers should go back to S1 because they missed a whole lotta points. The rest, give S2 a chance and get ready for the grand finale!"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"I found it pretty sleepy. Even had to go back and rewatch a few episodes due to having fallen asleep.  I felt there was nothing all that new in it, knew who would win from the start (well duh!), And generally I thought the acting was pretty bad for the most part.  Hype is hype... And this was hype."

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,3,,Loved season 1. Had me totally gripped. Been waiting all year for season 2. It was so boring. Actually really disappointed in it. Characters were not as relatable as the first series and none were really likeable. Games were boring. Not enough games in it at all. Really had high hopes for this. Think they should have left it at 1 series. I binged watched it in one sitting but felt myself being distracted a lot and my concentration definitely not kept like it was for series 1. Will be a season 3 for definite but not sure I'll bother watching. I'm sure some will enjoy it but it's not for me this time.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"All these caucasians complaining about the VIPs about their accent or their oddly scripted lines are hilarious to me. I mean hollywood has been doing this to asians for decades, guess everyone feels weird now that it is happening in reverse. For example, Hiring different asian person to play a specific role about a specific asian nationality, hiring white ppl to play asian characters. Not even really learning the correct language or bother to learn the correct pronunciations of their lines. Or even write them a proper line in their own language in a show or a movie. Or forcing asian actors to have an asian accent when the said actor does not actually have one. I guess decades of watching random ppl portraying asians in some gibberish accent has always made me cringe. Now everyone gets to experience it as well hahaha."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Honestly the best tv show i've ever watched. Recommend it definitely 100%. Everyone should watch it, I finished the whole season in a day and a half."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"Good writing, good acting for most part (except the American actors), good messages, pacing is good.  There really isn't much to complain about it once you're immersed into it besides the voices and acting of the American actors."

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"Netflix seems to be able to find these ""box set""versions of visual cocaine that make one unable to stop the 'next episode' button. This Korean paranoid vision of game show euthanasia does kinda feel like something I'd seen it before, Battle Royale, The Cube, Maze Runner and even The Prisioner spring to mind. However, if you can get past the slightly weird dialogue and the slightly uncomfortable attitude towards women then it's a beautiful looking and engaging series."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,A tentacular dystopian vision of the depths those deserted of luck will descend to in order to recover their losses. Combines schadenfreude shades aplenty alongside some outstanding performances while asking some questions you might not want to find an answer to.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"One of the best K Netflix series I've seen in recent years. The plot, cinematography, and acting (with the exception of some masked caucasians in the end) was superb. Several A-list actors were in this show and the cameos by them were very well woven into the story.  Although its brutal - its more brutal in what's actually going on, and what's happening - than being graphically brutal.  And you will sit there and feel lots of things - scared and somewhat freaked out as well, and as I said: its Uncomfortably geniusly made in my opinion. Just binged the whole 9 episodes, best thing I've seen on Netflix since I opened my account. Even though it's dubbed, you hardly notice! Watch it, you won't be disappointed!"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"Many reviewers have commented on the ""horrible acting"" of the VIPs. I sense their lack of emotion is intentional. It is indicative of their lack of normal human empathy.  Overall I found the story to be interesting and that the story compelled me to continue watching through to the end. In that regard, the production was well done.  The conclusion and theme is not anything that I can praise however. Life is not purposeless nor is everyone bad and lacking in virtue. I have viewed so many Asian films that purport to say ""life is futile"".  Life is worth living. Life has meaning. That is my hope and faith. So I stand against the theme of the production but I found it interesting and entertaining. Entertainment is its only value."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"I agree with others about the VIPs acting and line being awful. I watched it dubbed in English, so it could be translation, or voice acting that went awry. Otherwise the dub was quite good(well for dub standards). I think I'll be watching it a second time with just subtitles.  South Korean cinema has become so popular in the West because it carries a certain gravitas and detail many western movies lack these days. I'm far from a film buff who looks forward to Tribeca or Sundance, but I can confidently say there is a distinct discipline displayed in South Korean films and shows. From the emotions on display by talented actors, to scripts that rely more on showing over telling, to the amazing seeds sown early that lead to payoffs later. And it's all wrapped up in great cinematography.  Squid Game is no different. It might not reach the heights of OldBoy or Parasite or even I saw the Devil, and is a little more predictable. But it is a must watch for fans of South Korean films."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"This series revolves around a game show where players have to compete against each other and play simple games to stay alive. Horrible things happen to the people who lose and people can go to any extent to win the game. Back stabbing, treachery become commonplace when your survival depends upon the other players losing the game. This series perfectly depicts the human nature when they are pitched against each other.  I love the fact that the makers have carefully chosen each game in such a way that though these are kids games, they can lead to a terrible fight among the players and show the true nature of each of them. However, I think since the season 1 is a blockbuster hit, they are now trying to drag the story for seasons after seasons. If this continues after 3-4 seasons, boredom would kick in."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"Battle Royale, As The Gods Will (literally about kid's games in a death challenge environment), Alice in Borderland, Hunger Games, etc. And those are just the Asian ones...  This really didn't do anything special or anything unique. The story dragged on during some moments, wouldn't be surprised if they were trying to stretch out the episodes. Episode 6 was the best one and had some of the show's best acting.  The last 3 episodes were really bad and uninspired and clearly just meant to setup a season 2 which is annoying. All the character arcs are thrown out the window, a police officer investigating this deadly game has a lackluster ending, and the reveals.... meh? The 'protagonist' learns nothing by the end of the film, so there's zero character arc.  I'll give it a 6. It's entertaining to watch the games and their thought process but I can't give it anymore than that thanks to the lackluster ending. Now an ending can be disappointing but I want rate an entire series on JUST an ending (like Game of Thrones). But the fact this did nothing new at all and flat out copied movies. People are saying some of the above movies I mentioned are fantasy, but there's another movie I can't think of where people volunteer to play for money in a very realistic setting that is basically the same thing...  Nothing new, acting is OKAY, some major plotholes or scratch your head moments, and not a good conclusion. I know they're setting up for season 2, but how they set it up is pretty stupid. And I don't think it needs to go there to begin with."

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,I loved this show for many reasons. The story was great I loved the concept and characters. The violence and gore was great too. The downfall is the bad acting at times it's kinda laughable bad. Overall a great surprise and I want more seasons even if it's with a new cast. I want more !!!
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,Really great show. Loved it but found it strange like so many others that the VIP actors are so horrible bad in delivering their lines. It's almost if Tommy Wiseau and the cast from The Room hid behind the VIP masks. Anyway I can live with the bad acting in that episode because everything else is just fantastic.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"Just my opinion, i think 1st season much better than this, coz the gaming scene more thrill but still enjoyable to watch, hope getting better for 3rd season.  The live or death game is not thrill anymore, its just fun and predictable that's why i dont enjoy it much i know they want to show new game but for what i see its not more thrill than 1st season, just like watch a gaming episodes in a tv show like running man, its just fun and enjoyable.  Once again its just my opinion, i'm not a profesional reviewer or something else, just a regular fans from this series that waiting much long from the 1st season."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,5,,The decision making of the characters is painfully bad and most of the acting is over done and cringey. There are also random side stories and characters that have absolutely no relevance to the show.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"A series that combines artistic creativity, visual creativity, and genius in the acting performances of the heroes of the work, which rises to be the best series I have watched produced by Netflix, despite the dark side of the story.

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,I wont say much but just WOW. It has everything I was looking in a series & more.  (Some saying VIPs sucked yeah but that doesn't affect the series much Idk why they're making it a big issue) A total bingeworthy content kudos to the creators & actors.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Unexpected movie, brilliant idea,. This is one of the Best movie this year, Jobwell done !!! Netflix should continue to produce a movie like this.. 👍"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"As per my title this isn't a very original idea. It's been done time and time again: Highlander (1986), Battle Royale (2000), The Hunger Games (2012), Animal World (2018) etc. The only difference is the venue/place where they are held and the winnings at the end.  I tried to watch this when it first appeared on Netflix, but after 3 episodes it still hadn't impressed me, and was quickly forgotten when I found something better to binge watch. After seeing all the hype about it I decided to give it another go, perhaps I should have given it 4 episodes? Nope it still didn't impress.  I have to question the '111 million fans' claim by Netflix. I'm more inclined to believe it is 111 million 'Viewings' that include the multiple viewings by single individuals or their group friends at home or around at their friends houses when their parents are away. Viewings do not correspond to fans.  The acting is your usual frenetic Korean overacting, overdone facial expressions combined with family honour/disappointment.  The main characters, although given back stories, aren't what you would consider likeable so you don't really invest too much empathy into who will or won't survive, bearing in mind that 'There can be only one' (to quote Highlander) winner at the end of the game.  My only real interest was in working out who was behind the whole setup of 'Squid Game' and who the 'Frontman' was. The clues are there and it didn't take me too long to have a (correct) working theory.  I suppose if you are looking for some 'bloody' entertainment, that you can disengage your brain to watch, then this will meet your needs.  I gave it a generous 6 stars as while it isn't as good as it is hyped to be it certainly isn't as bad as some of Netflix's underwhelming prior offerings."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"The VIP actors in Season 2 really dragged the entire series down. Honestly, where did they even find those people? My 9-year-old son could've done a better job! It was almost painful to watch those scenes, and sadly, this isn't the only Korean series that struggles with poor casting for side roles. To the producers of Korean dramas and films: please, just spend 10 dollars more and hire actors who can actually act-it really makes a world of difference in the viewing experience. That said, I still genuinely enjoyed the series. The main cast did a solid job, and the storyline had a strong emotional core that kept me invested. The pacing was tight, the suspense was well-built, and the production quality was top-notch. I especially loved the immersive settings and the bold, creative ideas behind the plot. With just a little more attention to casting minor roles, this could've been an all-time great. Still, it's definitely worth watching."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Im soo glad i watched this before all the hype started because shows are always ruined by hype and spoilers. Being completely new to korean telly, i was shockingly surprised by the story line, the drama, the acting, the cinematics and the entire shabang! Its the best series i have seen in a very very long time but i do feel it will be a one hit wonder. A season 2 just wont be able to match up to the buzz & excitement surrounding Season 1."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"The director seems intent on exhausting every possible configuration of tension, showing each micro-reaction: hesitation, betrayal, alliance, regret, flashback... This exhaustive exploration enriches the storytelling and gives each episode rare emotional density. However, it sometimes feels like the sequence of events is secondary, as long as the final outcome is achieved (who dies, who survives). This approach weakens surprise and makes some developments predictable-even formulaic."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,2,,"It's probably been said enough by now, but this show just isn't worth watching past Season 1.  If the creators were determined to expand the SG universe, I would've preferred a prequel exploring how the games began, especially through the lens of a young Player 1.  But honestly, with talent like this, I wish they had told a completely new story outside the SG universe. Something with a fresh lesson, the same emotional weight, and the creativity that made Season 1 so impactful.  Instead, we got what feels like a cash grab, with recycled themes and hollow echoes of what worked the first time.  I'm still interested in what these creators do next. I just hope the SG universe has finally reached its end."

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,It started way much better than it ended and by mid-season the series had too many useless long scenes that didn't help the drama...  The characters build up was good and most of the main characters has depth but all the events are way way too predictable and in too many instances you waste 5 or more minutes of watching things you already know it will happen with no twists happening  Also at the first few episodes it had meaningless flashbacks to things happened literally 3 mins before which made feel weak and and shallow...
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"I enjoyed Squid Game but feel it's rather overrated. I've been a big fan of far eastern and in particular Japanese and Korean movies for many years.

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"Pros * interesting premise * atmospheric * some of the acting is very well done * some character development is well done  Cons * character personalities change at random * some over the top acting * some overly stereotypical characters * premise doesn't have any real foundation * it ignores the potential sociocultural insight  Pros The story underneath it all is an interesting one. The same general idea isn't a unique one (eg. It's similar to Brazil's ""3%""), but the my build in enough sub-plots, mystery, and kind of cliffhanger endings, for it to have a fair bit of intrigue.  The setting also works. Real life scenes in the city are mostly either dark or grey, contrasting with the childlike bright colours and symbols of the games. It's definitely quirky and somewhat atmospheric.  Cons But that's all let down by some weak acting, annoying voice actor in the English dubbed version, and characters either who are too stereotypical or whose personalities change in a whim.  There's some decent acting and character development as well, but it's way overdone (exaggerated facial expressions and 'tantrums') by the main character and a several of the stereotypical ones are where the acting is really overdone.  By the end, when they start revealing the motivations behind it all;m, it gets pretty weak, stereotypical (again), and exaggerated.  In addition to this, there's so much potential for a political or sociocultural commentary. So much scope to address the changes in kids habits (from active and interactive physical and outdoor games and the creativity of making up new ones, to iPad and PC screens all day long). And more so, to address the poor dying and struggling to survive to make money that for most is never actually within their grasp, while the rich do nothing but exploit them. (The latter is what ""3%"" does really well). But the dialogue doesn't really touch on the issues at all. More focus on blood and guts than on any potential insight.  Overall, too many characters make no sense, and it ultimately feels hollow in the end."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,5,,"The talk and reviews have me bewildered, I'm only up to Ep3 but am struggling after about 5 attempts to start bingeing.  I find it boring and really childish, with pretty ordinary acting.  The set design, art direction and general production values are very 1970's.  Two more attempts then I'll give up."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"WOW, there are so much twists, action, suspense, drama, and messages all packed in 9 episodes. It is hard to stop watching once you started. One of the best Netflix show ever. I really like the ending."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"You don't have to be a Korean drama fanatic to enjoy Squid game, it is great, the VIP team is lacking but otherwise everything else is just perfect............okay this isn't actually happening somewhere right 😂😂😂😂😂😂, with the desperation for money currently in the world I wouldn't be surprised🤦"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Those of you complaining about the VIPs are completely missing the point. This show is so damn clever. The VIPs are meant to be over the top, gaudy, and obnoxious. They're representing the type of rich, entitled aholes that enjoy this kind of entertainment. These are the same guys that would set up a game of hunting for humans. Fantastic show."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"After watching Attack on Titan I felt empty, I couldn't watch netflix anymore.  But this one guys, I don't know what to say. A cult! One of the best and emotional shows ever produced! Episode 6 represents TV at its peak."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,,,"The show is so bland! I don't even know where to start. The acting is bad, and the characters do not make sense at the time. There is no depth whatsoever, there is nothing between the lines and the story doesn't add up. I really hope the rating would fall below 7/10 since this doesn't make any sense."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Too many bloody, violences, cruelties, and inappropriate scenes. I suggest that it could be made softer and a bit more elegant, then it could be more interested to watch it. I can only give it 10 starts because I cannot make that movie, but I can help them to make it better."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"Squid Game made a massive impact worldwide, drawing attention for its high-stakes survival games and social commentary. The series is undeniably visually striking, with its bold color palette, meticulously designed sets, and tense cinematography creating an immersive dystopian world. The concept of ordinary people competing in deadly childhood games is initially gripping and emotionally charged, showcasing desperation, moral dilemmas, and the lengths humans will go to survive.  However, after closer examination, the show feels somewhat overrated. While it received immense global acclaim, many elements are familiar, and the narrative is not particularly innovative. Survival game plots with social critique have been explored in literature and media before, and Squid Game does not significantly expand on these ideas. Some plot twists feel predictable, and certain character arcs are underdeveloped, leaving emotional beats less impactful than intended.  Despite these criticisms, the performances are solid, especially from Lee Jung-jae and HoYeon Jung, whose portrayals bring depth to the main characters. The series also succeeds in reflecting social inequality, greed, and human vulnerability, but the exploration is occasionally heavy-handed, sacrificing nuance for shock value.  In conclusion, Squid Game is entertaining and visually memorable, but its global hype may overstate its originality and storytelling depth. While it captures attention and provides intense, binge-worthy moments, the series ultimately feels somewhat formulaic and less groundbreaking than the media frenzy suggests.  Rating: 6/10 - A compelling watch, but not as revolutionary as its reputation claims."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,I totally love it so i will give it 10/10. A s a matter of fact all actors were incredible in their acting but the vib were not.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"I confess to watching every episode before realizing the characters were an overused, worn-out personality mix, the plot was predictable and the hundreds of assassination style killings were the central plot driver.  But still part me enjoyed the novelty, the exposure of human fragilities and the bright color sets and costuming.  The product is not that great, the remarkable popularity might be explained by the economic desperation many of us feel right now and perhaps it taps into a growing resentment toward the financial elite."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,1,,"The fact that this new series has recently been considered the latest cult hit and the reviews (including the established critics) celebrate this stuff is once again a sign of the stupidity and abstinence from reflection in modern times of the 21st century. So much is wrong with this series, yes, the whole idea behind it, that I hardly know where to start. But I'll try. The purely cinematic criticism first: The character development is ad hoc, in rapid succession and hardly comprehensible. The character development from the failed and disliked clown to the moral hero does not work and is wrapped in a bad script. The supporting characters are just vehicles and not much else. Scattered in to show humanity, friendship or criminal energy and ruthlessness here and there, they are ultimately not figures in themselves. The cinematography is okay, but far too obsessed with a disgusting aesthetic, which is so full of wealth, greed and hedonism that it is not the renunciation of such anti-values, but their celebration. The music / the score are completely irrelevant and immature. They have no influence on the film. The script has as many gaps as a Swiss cheese and storylines go untold. The actors are sometimes like that, but all in all they tend to be in the lower range of the theatrical talent factory. They often only convey one, and when the going gets tough, maybe two or three qualities that the script exploits like wood engravings. Aside from these obvious aspects, however, the worst thing about this entire series is its game of hide-and-seek. The producers and creators of the series pretend that they are telling a parable about wealth, unscrupulousness, greed for money and, in the ultimate end, a moral story about ethics, humanity and humanism, but aim at a target group that is not aimed at them in the same breath Interested in topics. Instead, the show should (and will be) driven to success by a target group that is fascinated by the sadism, the ruthlessness and the immeasurable wealth of a brutal game of chance. The last episode underlines this ridiculousness impressively. A game of double standards and also pure greed for money takes place here. Artistic? Love for the medium of film? Or an affection for pop culture? None of it. I have a hard time expressing how much I hate this series because the disgust at the partying reactions takes my breath away. Our world, like ancient Rome, seems to perish on the disgusting hedonism of our time. Have fun and welcome to the Squid Games. I'm out."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"Squid Game Season 2 is a thrilling continuation of the original, maintaining the suspense and social commentary that made its predecessor a global phenomenon. The new games are even more elaborate and deadly, pushing the boundaries of human endurance and morality. The characters, both new and returning, are complex and morally gray, forcing viewers to question their own values in the face of extreme circumstances. While some may find the violence excessive, it serves to highlight the brutal realities of poverty and desperation that drive individuals to participate in such a deadly game. Overall, Squid Game Season 2 is a captivating and thought-provoking series that will leave viewers on the edge of their seats."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,Nothing to say about it. Just wanted to say go and watch this series. This is ridiculous and awesome series I have ever seen.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"""Squid Game"" is definitely a slow burn in its first 2 episodes (but they do give you a taste of what's to come). As for the rest of the season, you probably won't be able to stop watching thanks to its story, characters, thrills, twists, games and, of course, gore."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"The First Season is a blast!  Re-watched it before Season 2, and damn, it hold its title as one of the best tv show out there.  The first time I heard squid game was from a friend when it first came out, and I was neither interested in checking it out or watching it (even the first episode); but there was this time that some of our friends wanted to stream the show, and I obliged (a friendly gesture) to stream it for them. And oh boy! The first episode HOOKED me on the show, and kept coming back!  Re-watching it makes it even more compelling, finally understanding the concept of the show and admire its complexity."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"The series is great and worth the watch. I have to admit I already called the twist by the second episode, but the journey was great. The latter part of the season lost its way with some heavy cringe characters but I'll look past that. My biggest gripe comes with the latter part becoming cliché and in violation of what previous episodes had laid down, as in everyone has a fair shot at winning whereas the game they played was in gross violation of that (episode 7). Give it a watch though."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"As a whole, Squid Game is a incredible show. However, as always with Netflix's greed, the show went downhill after S1. S1 was dark, but it also gave viewers the time to get attached to its characters, and the shock factor. However, as S2 arguably got split into 2, the series became less hard hitting and emotional. Towards the end, I felt like most of the characters growth in S2 was reversed, and their deaths were massively rushed and therefore less impactful. The last 20 minutes of S3 were not what I expected. However, the acting, suspense, and creativity involved in this show means that I can't rate it lower than a 7."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,3,,"Season one was original and interesting and terrifying. I must admit to violent for my taste, but a very intriguing and gripping story. Everything past that was a complete and utter let down. They basically just rehashed season one while adding a multitude of storylines over laying it to expand the universe, not to any benefit. Artistically some amazing and beautiful shots. But when all is said and done an absolute let down. Some truly terrible writing at times, especially for all of the VIP scenes. Speaking of the acting of the VIPs were utterly amateur at best. Unable to tell if that is the fault of the actors or director."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,Just watch it I watch a million TV shows & movies And I shoud say this is one of my best experiences.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,Really cared about these characters. It really made me attached to this movie. Great storytelling!
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"One of the most beautiful series I've ever seen, finished in a few days one episode led to another and the desire to follow the series increases more and more. The tension is built very well game by game and the main characters are really well developed."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,Yes very unique content most powerful never miss. Most enjoyable.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"I was really enjoying this series until the last episode... it completely threw out the awesome character arc of the protagonist to set it up for a second season when it was obviously supposed to end of a semi-downer ending... which would have been effective and great.  This film isn't that original. It really bugs me that American audiences find this to be so ""unique"". This concept has been used in many plots... for a long time... Especially in Asian cinema. So everyone should just relax.  Still, this is a pretty great series. I just feel sorry for anyone that has to watch the last episode..."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Plot, visuals, acts, scale... every elements were so well prepared and harmonized. The characters have distinct personalities and are very interesting.  According to the characteristics of each stage of the survival game, the appearances of the characters collide and gather whenever they encounter in extreme situations. All those factors fit each other amazingly well. Each character also represents an aspect of society issue or shape of human beings.  This movie is not only giving you entertainment, but also throw questions about matter of humanity, morals, strategy, social issues, family and the weight of life & death.  There is no scene to skip."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"From the first episode, Squid Game pulls you in and doesn't really let go. The mix of tense competition and its bold, almost surreal look makes it tough to turn off. The premise is simple, but it's pulled off in a way that keeps the tension high without feeling like it's repeating itself.  What hooked me most were the characters. You get this mix of personalities that feel messy and real, even in such an over-the-top situation. Some episodes land harder than others, but I liked how it blended quieter, more personal moments with all the chaos.  It's not flawless, but it's daring, memorable, and packed with scenes that stick in your head. If you're into shows that mix tension, style, and a little social bite, it's definitely worth a watch."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Season 1? 1000/10 Amazing, absolutely brilliant, ICONIC, top tier piece of entertainment!  Season 2?... 4/10 The acting is the only thing that saved it. After 4 f years, that's all we get?! Revolting and disappointing... 0 questions answered! I have even more now! Nothing to move us in a direction, just more filler stuff that can literally fit in an episode. They just stretched it to have a 3rd season to milk more money from this franchise.. it's sad, because S1 was fenomenal... Again, the acting was so good, and that's why it's so infuriating; you have this budget and top tier actors and you choose to use them like this?!  10/10 because S1 was a masterpiece.. but (4/10 for S2)..."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"I get the hype around this series, I just don't agree with it.  It's about a game that consists of multiple kids games. If you win one of those games, you go to the next round, but if you lose, you die. The person who wins the last game gets all the money.  The plot is basic and unoriginal. I feel like everyone can come up with it and it reminds me of a lot of other films I've already seen.  The worst thing about it, is that it's too predictable. I could already tell who would die and who would win after watching the first episode. That made it not exciting of course, because I was never scared for people to die. There were plot twists, but they just didn't surprises me and it wasn't as emotional as people said it was. I haven't shed a single tear, while I normally cry a whole ocean when I watch a simple Disney film.  I'm not saying this is the worst thing ever, maybe it just isn't for me. I don't regret watching it, but I'm not waiting for a second season either."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,5,,"Well what can I say? Season 1 was actually quite fun and interesting. But you had to accept the premise. I enjoyed it.  But I just gotta say season 2 is a miss. It lacks new stuff, character depth and everything gets boring. The pace is slow and outdrawn. Most of the characters are shouting all the time and it gets frustrating to look at. You are just sitting their and say ""come on get to the point!""  Moreover you can tell who is gonna die and who will survive. So you know how it's gonna end basically. Second season seemed unnecessary and does not contribute with something new and interesting."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Squid games is more than just a fun game show, it reveals to you the cracks in humanity. Season one sets the tone and gets you hooked, season two draws you into the lives of the characters, and season three ties everything together with its symbolism and deeper meaning. Many will be mad at the show for the ending but it is the most perfect conclusion to amplify the show's message. Not everyone is evil, but not everyone is good-everyone is a mix of both.  Those who are not ready for this type of emotional weight will skip right through it, however I highly encourage everyone to at least try to understand what this show means.  This show will leave wounds that may last for days but it is worth every second. It will leave you thoughtful and maybe even untrusting of your reality.  I cried for over an hour after finishing this show. I want to keep my review short because I do not want to spoil anything but have fun watching<3."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Never been a fan of K-dramas but this show has such a grip on me, I couldn't stop watching it if only to see how things will end for Gi-hun. There is something oddly familiar about his character and this, perhaps, is because we all have an inner slob within us. Here the show forces us to confront the question of what we will do if placed in dire situations such as the ones he faced. I understand that season 2 admittedly makes one think that the show runners can't possibly shock us anymore if we already know the game. But think again. This time, it's no longer just about playing by the rules but learning how to break them as well as being one step ahead of the Front Man. And the deadly cost of trying."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,This season 2 was worth the wait. The edge of your seat thriller is still there and keeps you glued. Promised myself a whole year i wouldnt binge it but of course i just couldnt stop. I just hope Netflix doesnt make us wait even 12 months for the final season 3. The conclusion is going to be epic. One character i must say i hated was Thanos. Like seriously what rapper in their right mind thinks they are that good they can name themselves after a Marvel Villian.  Anyway DO NOT MISS OUT on this one of a kind show. The writer of this should recieve some great award for bringing an actual decent tv show to people.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"The child/play elements, and the violence, make this show addictive.  However it's deeply flawed... The acting gamut is 'narrow' and you mostly see the same scenes over and over again... In summary, it's a close-up of a person being sweaty and teary, having slow, drawn out, unrealistic dialogues.  Also, supposedly it collapses on its own weight by being extremely unrealistic in terms of character decisions. Things often don't make sense, and it shatters the illusion for being a metaphor of society, to being a badly written script that you can no longer connect with.  Finally, the dialogues are next level childish and unrealistic, creating the perfect time to leave the room for a stretch or a snack, until the scene is over. And there are lots of moments like these."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"It's disturbing but all the more entertaining for it. I rarely watch series with a plot, let alone that fast (took me less than 4 days, which is super unusual for me). Read some reviews saying there was no character development but I will have to disagree. All major character change from ep 1 to their last respective scene. Some scenes were very emotional as well, ep 6 had me sobbing. The acting by the VIP's was a bit off-putting but ultimately didn't bother me as much. I loved the games too, being of Korean descent. Only the 5th game was somewhat out of order and dragged a bit. The additional storylines around the games made it even more real, somehow. There are some open ends which have me looking forward to the 2nd season."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"Don't believe the hype.  Don't get me wrong, the show was entertaining and watchable, the cast mostly did a good job, the visuals were good.  I liked it. But that's it. I just liked it. I wasn't blown away, it wasn't anything new to me, I won't remember this as a great show, I won't remember it as something that made me think about it a long time after watching.  It had nothing that stood out, no great twist, no real depth. Surely some people won't agree on this point, but if you consider the obvious criticism on capitalism shown here as something deep... yeah.  I found the build up in the first 4 episodes considerably more enjoyable than the second half of the series. The ending was just ok. Nothing more.  So in summary this was solid entertainment. Definitely not worth the hype but enjoyable if you have nothing better to do with your time."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Was not expecting how deeply it makes you feel for all of the characters, there's a real connection you feel which makes you want them to win even more. Great plot with unexpected twists, would recommend this to everyone I know and anyone reading this."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"It would probably be more thought-provoking if it weren't for the glaring errors.  Also, it proved to be rather something of a bait and switch. First, they say it's all about pulling oneself up by one's bootstraps but it turns out to be something quite different. Everyday, vulgar banality is all it was, after all."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Better cast, script and plot than Borderland!  Only downside- edge of the seat and non stop binging effect."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"If you liked any Black Mirror episode, imagine this series is 10 times better. Perversion, simplicity, emotion, action and drama, all in 1 package. A must watch."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"Squid Game Season 3 has some thrilling moments and a decent story, but it doesn't hit as hard as Season 1. The emotional connection with the characters isn't strong, and the deaths don't leave much impact.  The Front Man twist with Player 001 felt underwhelming, and Player 456's scene lacked the drama we expected. Considering his intense past, his role felt surprisingly muted. It was a missed opportunity for a powerful confrontation.  The ending was better than the online hate suggests-just not as big or surprising as we all hoped. Maybe our expectations were too high.  Overall, it's a good season with a few standout moments, but the magic of Season 1 is slowly fading. Worth a watch, but don't expect the same emotional punch."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,Nothing crazy the ending was pretty alright. I enjoyed it but people are going way too crazy over it. Most characters I just didn't really connect with and a lot of things were very predictable.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Way better than Hunger Games. Great story, actors, and moral choices and animal instincts of humans."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"Enjoyed a lot of it but.. It was predictable for the most part which is fine in most cases but I think a better plot twist at the end could've improved it. Also the Vip thing was weird and disappointing, the acting on them was... Pretty self explanatory.... Most characters were written quite well which I liked."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Held in suspense throughout, a furious desire to click on ""next episode"" as soon as it ends ... The atmosphere totally shifted between the cruelty of the games and the aesthetics of the naive and childish colored sets, as well as the very soundtrack. Focused on classical music while acts of a nameless barbarism take place before our eyes... To watch in original version even if we do not understand anything in Korean so as not to miss the great acting  The ending foreshadows a season 2 while being relatively surprising as to the identity of the creator of the game. A few small questions remain, but nothing important enough to be disturbing.  A great discovery that I recommend without hesitation if the big spurts of blood don't bother you too much."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"It grew on me after the first episode, it was somehow addictive so that must say something about me. It lost it's appeal when the VIP's were introduced, rich American businessmen who pay to see people get killed, I get that that is the story but the really bad acting and dialogue of these guys was cringeworthy. Shame, because the Korean/Pakistani cast were exellent, each and every one of them."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,2,,"After the novelty of Season 1 wore off, the makers and Netflix chose to milk the franchise. But the writing and character development in Seasons 2 and 3 leave you wondering whether this even deserves to be called Squid Game. What was once gripping and psychologically intense has been reduced to a hollow imitation of its former self.  The logic is laughable. Scenes are shoved in at the worst possible moments, grinding the narrative to a crawl. Instead of tension and suspense, you get interruptions that feel like clumsy distractions. The games, once the heart of the series, are now mediocre at best,stripped of ingenuity and thrill.  And then comes Season 3's wildest decision: introducing a newborn into the mix. It's not edgy, it's absurd. It's as if the writers decided to throw in random elements hoping something would stick, but it only proves how far the show has strayed from its original genius.  This franchise deserved the same bold, out-of-the-box thinking and quality writing that made Season 1 a global sensation. Instead, the decision to play it safe and squeeze out every last drop of fame has backfired badly. The result? A series that's as forgettable as it is frustrating.  If this weren't Squid Game Season 3 but some random show, I would've quit watching after Episode 3. Name alone is keeping viewers tethered and that's not a compliment."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,My first review... you will not regret watching this as fans of both thrillers and korean dramas... this film really has outdone itself.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"I initially gave this a 9/10... then it was mid way through my 2nd rewatch of the show when it clicked... I almost NEVER rewatch any show, and this is the first time I've ever watched a live action foreign show. That's what clicked and made me give it 10/10.  In such a short span of time, you get an emotional connection to the characters despite not even speaking the same language. The show has it's flaws, but by far one of the best shows I've ever seen."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"This is a fantastic show through the 3rd episode. It is mysterious, it will tickle your sci-fi bone as well. It's gory so if you aren't into that pass on this. I love what Korea and Japan are producing right now!"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Best Series I have Ever watched my whole life. I DONT think that I will ever watch a series so bingeworthy , so fun , so exciting ... Just Amazing."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,TBH THIS IS THE BEST KDRAMA IV WATCHED IN 2021. THE IDEA IS DIFFERENT FROM USUAL KDRAMAS. IT SHOWED US THAT THERE ARE MANY GREEDY PEOPLE THAT WOULD KILL AND BETRAY YOU FOR MONEY AND IT SHOWED HOW FRIENDS CAN SCARIFIES FOR EACH OTHER NO MATTER WHAT. I RLY LIKED IT AND I HOPE THERE IS SEASON 2 WHERE THE REVENGE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO DIED.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,My first K Series ever and I was not disappointed. The story and acting were both amazing.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,,,"This show is very well done, the set design is absolutely stunning, the actors (main ones) are pretty good, the character development is great as well. Some great emotional moments throughout. Awesome practical effects as well. The only gripe I have with it is the addition of other certain characters (episode 7) that are just awfully done. Awful acting (can barely read their lines right), and some cringy dialogue from those characters. They also tried to make them comedic, which was totally out of the blue and weird. They reuse the same song over and over for most of the series. And for the love of god, stop making Korean actors speak English. It's extremely hard to act in your second language, and you can tell some of the actors have never said a word in English. It really takes you out of the immersion. Overall, it's a really good show and worth a watch 100%."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,Keeping it short Pros 1. Interesting initial episodes 2. Good cinematics (although some shots were too dark)  Cons 1. Horrible soundtrack 2. Avg acting (in many cases overacting) 3. Multiple wasted side stories / appearances.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,1,,"The last thing people in a world afflicted by so many conflicts is a show that boast nothing but violence to the extreme. I stopped watching after the 1st episode.  No content whatsoever. Just disgraceful violence. My suggestion: Watch The Crown, The Queen's Gambit, Unorthodox, Ozark. Even Breaking Bad. Something they will make you think. Squid Game is bad content to the soul, to the mind. And what amazes me is that the whole world has become addicted to this brutal unnecessary bloodshed. World's gone crazy."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,I started it and thinking this is going to be a B-tvseries but it's AMAZING! When I think I know what's going to happen they throw a curveball.  What an amazing tvserie.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,Season 1 an easy 10/10. Season 2 I'm giving a 9/10. It has a good mix of certain familiarities with new aspects to keep it interesting and fresh. The Thanos character replaces the previous season's gang member as the antagonist amongst the participants. You have an eccentric shaman replacing the crazy/whacky participant from the first season. Yet they also have their own uniqueness that doesn't make it just copy/paste either. There are new games and I will warn you now. Once you hear the song for the mingle/merry go round game it will be stuck in your head. It's such a cool contrast between the innocent sweet song and the violence and danger of the game. And it's just damn catchy. The season ends abruptly leaving you wanting for more and I can't wait to see season 3.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"The plot is similar to SAW and LOST. But,the Korean makers have given enough depth to the characters in this web series, that you feel for the characters even though it is predictable. There are enough shock value moments that keeps you hooked. Worth binge watching!!"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"The main ideas of the series is what money can buy in this world, what makes your life worth living, what is the cost of a human life. That is by itself a very good bunch of thesises to build up. But when I was watching this show, I always felt that person that was developing characters isn't suited for it at all. All the characters are very generic and cliched. At some point you could cling to them, feel some connection, root for them, the next minute you already feel sick of seeing them as they are being ruined for the sake moving the plot further. This is a typical battle-royal where you know that this exact character could die because he isn't written well enough and haven't got any screentime, but that other dude will certainly die because he's on your screen just because they need people for this kind of story.  Having said that, there are still plenty of good moments (i.e. Episode ""Gganbu"" was really dramatic and this is great considering what I said above), very good quality of filming, interior of the scenes, costumes. Overall, this series is worth to watch, but beware of annoying stupidly written dialogues and poorly realised character progression. If you're okay with synopsis - go watch it! But that's not really any kind of masterpiece."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"This reminds me of a lot of things; a mix of As gods will, Alice in borderland, Battle Royale, Kaiji etc. If you enjoyed those then you would like this series as well. Squid game is fascinating and keeps me on edge/ wanting more after each ep with how the games are set out it showcases a variety of Korean-style childhood games that I've never seen before. At the same time it can be a Melodrama that manages to provoke you emotionally and although it may be predictable at times it's definitely a enjoyable experience to watch. Not to mention players are interesting, with complex backstories and personalities. From a poor/ in-debt background they all strive with the same motive of money but at what cost? It's amusing to watch how everything unfolds but at the same time making you question a lot of things. I'm quite positive with how it left off that there might be a season 2 since there are a few things yet to be answered and revealed if so I wouldn't be surprised. Hats off to all the the people working on this project and the wonderful actors. Definitely felt like a roller coaster ride. Personally thought it was exciting, intense and satisfying watch for those who like this type of genres."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"Fun series, but lacks the psychological complexity and extreme levels of suspense we know from Kaiji. That said, Kaiji I was so intense I had to pop a couple Xanax while watching it to keep from having a panic attack.  Squid Game isn't Kaiji, but the productions looks nice and it's entertaining enough. The narrative relies on well-established tropes, making the story highly predictable. You will probably guess the ""twist"" at the end very early on. So watch Squid Game if you are looking for an afternoon of light entertainment, just don't expect it to explore any uncharted territory.  If you were hoping for something a bit more psychological, but without the unfettered intensity of Kaiji, then check out LIAR GAME. I like really enjoyed the 2014 Korean remake with Lee Sang-yoon."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"I have not much to say about it, it would be a waste of time.  Some years ago people read fifty shades of grey thinking it was literature, now they watch this pretending it is cinematography.  They were both made to amuse naives with primitive instincts.  P.s. Do not watch this while eating. Actually do not watch this at all. It's pointless.  Edit : Having been sick with fever and stuck to bed I managed to watch through the whole series. (I guess this was the only way to go through the episodes) Having done so I'll have to change my original 1-star rating to 8-star because some significant points were made later in the series, concerning human nature, which were thought provoking and I actually found interesting. Still believe that it is gross though and not suitable for the faint hearted or those that can't bear the sight of blood or actually any kind of sensitive and/or sensible person. They will feel disgusted. But conclusively I don't regret watching it."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,5,,"The first season is compelling tv. I binged the hell out of it. Pacing and story was great. S2 and 3 are average verging on bad. Drawn out, overacted, melodramatic, and goes everywhere and nowhere. Too many plots, too many characters. The subplot with the cops is pretty useless and adds nothing. The subplot of the guard is interesting but goes nowhere. The jump rope episode is painful to watch. Sometimes the sets are incredible and others look like a kids' Funtime center. I don't even care that I finished it, so if you've only watched the first season, I'd say keep it that way if you don't want your experience soured."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"I'm a bit late to the party on this one but I joined my son in watching Season Two over Christmas. It is eerily disturbing and utterly brilliant. I then went back to watch Season One. I am now eagerly awaiting season Three this year. The terrifying thing is, this could actually happen in real life. It's addictive to watch and the juxtaposition between the soft friendly music and the horror that goes with it, is just brilliantly done. I am not at all into gore as a rule but the way this is filmed makes it impossible not to get drawn in. I now keep singing the Waltz theme and the roundabout song in my head. I just can't wait for Season Three."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"A number of excellent films have come out of South Korea over the past decade or so. Now this, a blinder of a TV series. Absolutely fantastic. Was thinking of cancelling Netflix but glad I didn't."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Fan of this show from day 1, the storyline was great. All the cast and crew had done their part perfectly. Season 1 ended with a thrilling tail end. The second season had become much lighter than the first one, considering the intensity of the games, but still the suspense in the story was great. When Season 3 started, no one would have thought the climax would be like this. It is the perfect climax for this great show. The way the protagonist conveyed the real meaning of being a human was astonishing, He showed the world that there is still goodness in humans. Not everything can be bought with money. The tail end of this season is leading to another dimension of the game where more thrilling games and mysteries will unfold. Talking about the characters in the show. The way everyone supported and cared for the baby was heartwarming. As always, the bad characters in the show had done justice to their roles. I am sure that everyone felt happy when they got eliminated. The background musics as always was engaging. To conclude The one thing that holds us humans together is love. This message is been strengthened in the show."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"Truly a well-directed, well-acted, well-produced and casted series. I dare say I wish it could continue, but all games must end to have a victor!  Thank you for this very bingeworthy story. Thank you all cast and crew involved. Despite not knowing more than 3 words in Korean I recognized several actors. Goes to show, Hollywood ain't everything!  *To those that find this 'boring', please understand you need Michael Bay or shiny keys to keep your attention. *snap* Hello?! Are you listening?!*"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"""You don't trust people because they are trustworthy. You do it because you have nothing else to rely on""  Squid Game is thoughtful, provocative, and darn productive in every sense. Still, I would refrain from labeling it as some 'Masterpiece'. Contrary to popular belief, it's not perfect. Trust me, it has its fair share of flaws just like others do. Yes, there are certain areas where it beats all our expectations, especially compare to all those series that had shared similar concepts before; yet, the deficiencies are a bit difficult to disregard whatsoever.  If you ask me to recapitulate my impression in a single sentence, I would say; this is a well-acted, terrifically communicated (albeit outstretched) piece of work that would have no complications in attaining its unique set of audience (and judging by the current numbers, it already gathered enough).  I love how they upheld a certain amount of credibility and constancy in their dissertation throughout these nine episodes. All the Social/Political innuendo makes it even more so worthy I reckon. Even though I shouldn't be discussing all these in detail as I do not see myself sufficiently qualified to make an argumentative critique on the differences that are ever-present between Capitalist & Communist ideologies. Instead, I'm leaning towards a more humane/psychological side of it.  All these characters, personalities, come alongside their own set of guilts, motivations, purposes; a fascinating take on the human psyche, that is relatable on so many levels. Thus, their persistence and misery convey absolute legitimacy. And if you dare to take a closer look, the revelations might shock and terrify, as this is nothing but a reflective image of the society we all live in.  From deliberately exposing the survivalist, ruthless instincts that are embedded deep in our subconscious since the beginning of our kind to showcasing this horrible world that is fraught with Greed, Expectations, and Disparities. This series undoubtedly has tremendous depth in its underlying messaging, more than anybody could ever imagine.  In the end, the show poses a stern challenge against the very foundation of humanity or should I say the moralities of it. Furthermore, it begs the question; what it takes to be a human being? And are we even entitled to call ourselves one?"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"I wasn't experting a lot from this series, because movies/series that are this hyped are not usually the best. But this was great!! First of al the idea was awsome and the achting was exeptional, exept for the awful VIP's (but i loved the masks they where wearing) The set design is som of the best i have ever seen in any movie/series. The only thing keeping me from giving it a 9 is the ending. I won't go into it, but it is not at all what i was hoping for. I also love that Netflix is investing in foreign cinema, and the risk that they took was absolutely worth it!  So i absolutely recomend this te everyone who can handle a little blood.  PS: sorry for the bad english, I'm dutch so you know....."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"A true survival series and extremely suspenseful. Enjoy it, well worth it!!!"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Squid game is what I can only describe as an evolution of the Battle Royale genre, what I mean by that is that you have a premise of putting x people into a deathmatch situation where only the best or luckiest individuals can get out alive. This heavily reminds me of Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor (Anime) and another movie called As the gods will, but this series did something quite unique and unthinkable which deconstructs many tropes and cliches.  Honestly this is very well made, You get to feel for everyone's struggles and motivations to the point where it becomes relatable.  I highly recommend you to give it a watch!"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"Great series! Story, characters, setting, and mood was nice. Except for the actors who played the VIPs. That was terrible acting and it could have been better casted and directed. But all in all, season 1 was great!"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"I could have done without the mandatory woke content from Netflix, as well as the nudity and useless profanity. This stuff brings nothing to the story. I started watching Korean shows because there is none of that, that is before Netflix started to produce content for this country. Other than that, good show and solid acting except for the vips, you know, the evil white men."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,,,"I'm not certain how this show got so much hype, maybe there's money involved? The plot is predictable and not a very good plot at that. The dubbing is out of sync, I found it all very painful. I revisited it twice but never got further than the first twenty minutes. I question the comment on Netflix ""'Squid Game' is Netflix's most-watched show ever"" with why? No stars and would give it a minus if I could."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"With the third season, ""Squid Game"" has reached its end - in this current format anyway. I've written reviews for each season, that you can find against the final episodes of each run but I think I should put something here about my thoughts overall.  Desperate for money, Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae) agrees to partake is a mysterious game. Along with 499 other volunteers he is drugged and taken to an island and participates in various versions of children's games where the ultimate reward is an obscene amount of money, but the risk of failure is death. Between the games, alliances are formed and broken, and the true nature of the competitors comes out.  What could be a cheap exploitation style show is elevated by so much work spent on investing in the characters - their backstories and motivations - as well as by the performers who do such a good job of playing them. All of the seven or so principal characters are excellent but it's Lee Jung-jae who is the lead and has the most transformative role. Gi-hun initially starts as a shady and unlikeable character, but one who's heart and kindness grow across the run until you can't help but love him.  I think perhaps it's best to remember that, for all the hype around the series now, the first one worked by taking a relatively simple concept and imbuing it with such rich characterisation that it mattered to you what happened to the individuals in the game. That is, I think, what happens in this second season two, even if perhaps the split of time between the games, the guards and the security team dilute it all slightly. Maybe some of the characters are bigger, certainly ""Thanos"" is a standout in this run, as is the crazed Seon-nyeo, but at heart is the core characters that you come to know and care about again.  At the conclusion of the series, I guess my main thought was that I didn't feel that seasons two and three did need to be split into two sub seasons and that with some more judicious editing it could easily have been one. I don't think it would have been particularly difficult to cut it down either, there are numerous sequences that could just have been run through quicker."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"Criticize the VIPs all you want, but don't ding the show for the VIP's bad acting, poor scripts, and being terribly out of place altogether. I believe all of that is intentional. We, as viewers of the show, are just like the VIPs. We are paying for our Netflix subscriptions to fund the show's production, and watching this ""game"" fold out for our entertainment. It's no wonder these VIPs purposefully speak English.  If you're disgusted by the VIPs (and hopefully most of us are), then you should be disgusted by ourselves and our roles in society."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"Despite how predictable was the plot, I watched it in two days. Well done!  BTW, wtf with those VIP characters at the end, they were obnoxiously cringe. Bad acting or they made them on purpose?"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"This series is a purely television masterpiece, as it presented us with a new and completely unrepetitive idea and this is what made us enjoy in every episode because we see things that we are not used to seeing much, in addition to that it discussed many important issues such as the accumulation of debts on humans, as well as equality between Individuals and other issues. And in the end I put it back again This work is a purely television masterpiece."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"The premise is interesting end entertaining. However, the character development is very poor and random (ie. Characters decide to suddenly become ethical out of nowhere and despite it contradicting their whole previously established traits).  The justification behind the games is also very underwhelming even though it was meant to be some kind of big reveal.  This show gives very much a ""we live in a society"" vibe... Some plot twists feel like they were written by a 12 yo middle schooler.  I don't know if it's the norm for Korean shows but sometimes the acting feels cartoonist although most of the time the acting is pretty strong. Also beautifuly shot.  6/10 don't believe the hype."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"I knew who is who by the 3-4. Episode, but good characters and story. Exciting, thrilling, brutal, sensitive."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,I never made a review before but this series is totally worth a review. I really like how it handles to make such great tension in every single episode! Totally worth-to-watch series!
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"I think I haven't seen a more creative kdrama than squid game. And you can really see the hardwork and dedication the director has put into this great work of art.  The characters, their motivations,cinematography, acting ,everything is top notch. Only complaint I would have would obiviously be VIPs but nonetheless best drama from korea till now."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"The plot is great, the acting is superb & the soundtrack is very neatly placed! Squid Game manages to shock, excite & pull your heart strings right from the get go. A must watch if you're up for some good time & aren't easily disturbed by some gore."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,,,"Squid Game is more than just a thrilling survival show-it's a sharp look at the harsh reality of social inequality and the struggles of ordinary people. The series brilliantly shows how economic hardship pushes people to extreme limits, all while exposing the widening gap between the rich and the poor.  The players in the game, all drowning in debt, represent everyday people who are desperate and willing to risk everything. Their fight for survival highlights how poverty and financial pressure can strip away a person's dignity. The rich VIPs watching for entertainment are a disturbing reminder of how the wealthy profit from the suffering of the less fortunate, a direct commentary on real-life social and economic divides.  Squid Game not only keeps you on the edge of your seat with its intense story, but it also makes you think deeply about the unfair systems in place in the real world. The show paints a clear picture of how people are often trapped by poverty, while a select few at the top control the outcome.  With its gripping plot and powerful message, Squid Game is a must-watch that will stay with you long after it ends."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"I quite enjoyed watching squid game. Its a cool series with a very original idea.  I love how many characters are named and given a back story. They keep the games they play fresh each time, every season through. I also like how the games start to brake down in the second season. Its nice to not have a second season that is a copy of the first. The third follows up on the second and brings it to a nice end with some cool surprises.  The games themselfs are based on korean games. Which for a korean movie is ofcourse a nice add. Keeping to your own style instead of copying others.  Now i will say there are moments and plot in the series that are sometimes a little too predictable. But they don't take away to much. Some tropes and stories also don't really make sense, but it doesn't weigh up against all the possitives the series has.  Its a great serie and we wont see much quite like this in the near future."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"The gameplay in the film is very interesting and challenging, but the execution at the end feels lacking."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"Great acting,solid script,a fresh taste. Definitly worth watching.  Really makes you wonder,is it really different in real life?  There are millions of people literally dying from hunger and diarrhea. Not 465,millions. There are enough food,resource,medicine for all humankind but we don't want to share or we simply don't care. Like 10 richest people in the world could fed millions of people if they want to,but they don't. We,people of the world,could improve the standards of life for them very easily ,but we don't care. We simply don't. No need to lie.  So if you think this is a distopia,it's not. It is reality,just more bloody or let's put it this way,you have to watch them die because you have to,not like in real world.  VIP acting is a mess though. ;)"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"A bleak ending that feels rather unsatisfying without much reason for a lot of the subplots. A lot of recycled moments with interesting variations but not enough to feel fresh. Overall it feels forcible written just to bump viewership. Regardless I am still emotionally invested with the intense situations & stakes. Amazing set design, a moving score, & acting that carries the needed weight."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,1,,"The fact that Squid Game is the #1 series in the World right now helps explain a lot when it comes to the fact that everyone seems to be mentally disturbed these days.  Interesting and fast-paced series, yes. But VERY disturbing."

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"The idea is phenomonal, to create some fun for those who have every social and material satisfation within normal human societies and to offer an opportunity for those who are nothing and have nothing within normal human societies. Inspiring extreme setting, but we should be careful that it cannot represent the whole society."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"The best way to describe this show is the feel of black mirror and the politics of parasite. I loved every second of this show from the characters,plot to the games,although I loved this show but please don't make a season 2 make this a one time thing it ended great and I feel like a season 2 would just drag the premise. Don't fall into the trap of other shows where the first season was brilliant but the later seasons were downgraded in quality."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"Squid Game is one of the best foreign shows ever made tense, emotional, and visually unforgettable. The first season is an absolute masterpiece, blending social commentary with gripping suspense in a way that's fresh and bold. Season 2 keeps the energy alive with strong character arcs and shocking moments.  Season 3, while still entertaining, feels a bit uneven compared to the earlier seasons, with pacing issues and some plot choices that don't hit as hard. Even so, the show's creativity, performances, and ability to keep audiences on edge are unmatched.  Overall, Squid Game remains a must watch. It's a rare series that sparks conversation worldwide, proving that great storytelling transcends language."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"The first season is simply perfect - engaging story, excellent pacing, and well-developed characters. The second starts off amazingly, with exciting episodes and a gripping atmosphere, but it loses steam as it goes on, ending in a somewhat disappointing way. The third, on the other hand, is a complete disaster: weak plot, poor execution, and none of the spark the series once had."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"They just suck. Everything about them is just bad, they were build up to be so cool but so disappointed."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"The planes, the colors ... they caught my attention.  I loved the special effects in terms of makeup, they are very well done, the slow cameras and the uncensored blood they put on is incredible.  The story, I have to say, is very well about: we are all the same (no one is better than anyone), but we are all different (you do not know the problems that some people and their lives have). It's a great highlight in this series.  Very emotional and thoughtful, a clear evolution of characters is seen, with the games and their companions.  I read just today (I finished it last week) that they plan to do a second installment and that they are already ruminating ideas ... I do not think it is ""necessary"".  By this I mean that the series is complete as it is, nothing is missing.  If you really think you need more, make it up yourself."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"I keep seeing people saying that the characters were told that only 1 people could survive. I don't know if they watch a wrongly translated version or what but the version i watch they are told they all can win the prize as long as they finish the 6 games.  I also get that the VIPs acting and ""intonation"" suck, but keep in mind this is a korean show so why would they accurately portrait americans?  Show is amazing, main characters acting is superb and music is very good. Just enjoy."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"Naah, the whole squid game disappointed me as a whole, specially the high hopes it made in season 01, couldn't be filled in later seasons.....and this is I am saying after completing season 03.  The full season 01 was 9/10 for me. The introduction of the plot and procedures for the first time isn't a easy task, it becomes a boring thing.....but squid game actually peaked here. They introduced this whole world carefully, and parallelly the plot regarding detective was well planned behind the games. Every episode was engaging, offered new things in every scenes. The drama was on point, shred my tears two times. The plot twists were also one after another. Really it had all the qualities to be celebrated as a international phenomenon. Except the game on the glass bridge, which I found as a plot armor for the hero only (hence 9/10 instead of 10/10).... I liked all other aspects there.  Season 02 and 03 isn't bad per se, but could not touch the achievements season 01 touched anytime. Things which gave squid game an international recognition, didn't work for 2nd time. At times there were new, interesting, original concepts....but I think there were so many things still which were not taken into account. The story of purple soldiers could have been expanded more, but only used a little, just the amount plot needed. Our hero here didn't fall into the moral dilemma like season 01 with that old in marbel game. There were interesting characters like Thanks, old lady and others....but with 12 episodes of s02 and s03, they just fall flat before those 9 episodes of s01. They were epitome of storytelling.  Overall, since I had such high hopes for it, I am disappointed. From an international phenomenon to a one time watchable series....the squid game ends it's journey."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,I haven't enjoyed a first season like this since Westworld and can't recommend this enough. Was a little bit jarring at first but really merged a lot of genres that had never been done before and knocked it out of the ballpark. A+
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"I really like Squid Game. Terrific acting, visually amazing, and fully engaging with a pure-hearted main character walking through hell. Also, the directing was outstanding. I hope there will be another season."

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Great acting, heart and soul, lots of action and hard decision making. A tad slow at first, but after ep 2, I couldn't look away. At times I wanted to but I just couldn't. Definitely recommend."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"The first season of this show was mostly very good but to be honest I think it could of been done in 6 episodes rather than 9. At times it seemed dragged out and certain points were repeated.  I won't mark it down for that because I'm sure other people liked that about it. I'm sure there will be more seasons but I'm not sure how they will make it something different so time will tell.  Lots of gore, some jump moments, a small amount of sex and nudity.  Some of it was predictable but then there were a certain amount of clues that not everyone will pick up on.  Recommended."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,.... And it'll do its job. The games gave me anxiety and goosebumps. Definitely worth watching a few episodes at a time.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"Very slow, I expected it to catch me from chapter one and in the middle I stopped it to finish it another day. The idea is not bad but in general it is not what I expected."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,1,,"What is going on here? How can this show be praised like it is? This series is positively garbage...  It's first degree from A to Z, the writing and acting are deplorable (oh the rotten discussions on the meaning of life!), the message distressingly banal, if not non-existent. Manichaeism in all its glory..  The choice of music (Blue Danube from top to bottom) to emphasize the decadent atmosphere is pathetically heavy too. I really don't understand what people can find in this interstellar piece of trash that looks like it was written and directed by an 8 year old child, considering how subtle is it.  Nothing is credible, everything is predictable, the characters are caricatures (OMG, the ""VIPs""...)  What's the so-called great political and social message? That people will do anything for money? That's the great originality of the thing, seriously?  I haven't seen anything that ridiculous or grotesque for a long time."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"I appreciated the effort put into this programme, the meaning of money, human relationships, good or bad. The options we used were overdubs in English, there are plenty of them and subtitles if you prefer. The acting even with overdubs is superb, all emotions are conveyed perfectly, be warned although the games are childlike they present severe consequences if you lose. Definitely a binge watch, you'll be wanting more and be prepared for those heartfelt moments,there are quite a few. It's the best programme I've watched for awhile I had no hesitation in give this Netflix series full marks."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"It definitely is not recommended for kids as it contains too much of foul language and few vulgar scenes, but overall it is good except such scenes.  I never watched any series before. When season 2 of Squid game released I thought to start watching it. I completed season 1 in 3 days and then the very next day completed the whole of season 2. It was very interesting and kept me involved since beginning. Each character was portrayed very well by respective actors. This was the first time I ever watched something from the Korean makers. Lee Jung-jae was extraordinary in his role.  Now waiting for season 3."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"Despite the hype, the plot is not original. It is a mixture of SAW, Cube, The platform and other similar films. It is kind of entertaining (if that could be said about a gore film) with a few nice plot twists, although some of them overstretched...Moreover, it depicts a version of the average South Korean with major financial issues, which I do not know if it is accurate or an exaggeration. Don't believe the hype. It is just another ""ok"" series."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,It is a unique concept based series. Never seen such series ever before. Totally Mind-blowing. It is a masterpiece.  Should watch it for sure.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"The series is well-produced, and the actors are decent. The story is unnecessarily slow at certain points, but the moments of tension are very well executed. It's impossible not to feel your teeth gritting and your muscles tense during the games, which, after all, are the only thing that really matters here. The plot about the cop searching for the island is kind of just filler, and 90% of the dialogues that happen between the games are extremely boring. The VIPs are awful, terrible actors playing meaningless roles. The idea was to portray cold, psychopathic, sadistic millionaires, but they end up looking like a bunch of morons. Anyway, I think it's worth watching mainly because of the game scenes. Tip: skip the dialogue scenes in season two and save some life time."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"Squid Game Season 3 slices straight to the bone with a fiercely focused storyline. Hwang Dong-hyuk crafts each episode like a loaded trap, delivering tightly wound tension and gut-punch twists that elevate the show's anti-capitalist core to operatic heights.  The characters shine in arcs that are both harrowing and deeply human. Jun-hee's defiant maternal instinct and Hyun-ju's quiet moral strength offer rare glimpses of hope, while Myung-gi's selfish pragmatism and Geum-ja's heartbreaking sacrifice expose the crushing toll of a rigged system. Dae-ho's collapse into betrayal and the Front Man's final reckoning deepen the season's emotional gravity, reminding us that in these games, survival often demands surrendering one's soul.  The finale lands with poetic brutality. Satisfying, haunting, and unflinchingly honest. It's a masterclass in thematic closure that dares to leave scars."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"This show is so well made. From a technical standpoint, it's shot beautifully and in a way to differentiate itself completely from other shows with similar tones. The lighting, the sets, the costumes, the locations, all fantastic!  The idea is great! Most things made sense both story-wise and character-wise. There were a few moments that were questionable when it came to character decisions but it's very easy to look past those as the majority of Squid Game was fantastic. The entire second episode was pretty much dedicated to really making it clear to the audience WHY these characters would subject themselves to such a game and it's done in such a way where it's all very believable.  I imagine there is, as always, some errors with Korean to English translation as some of the dialogue (in subtitle form) was incredibly on the nose and structured in a way where people simply don't talk that way but once again, it's easy to look past as the show is so interesting throughout and enjoyable.  It felt more like a 9/10 hour movie, rather than a series as each episode flows so seamlessly into the next and carries the momentum, especially when binge watching.  Highly recommended."

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"Do i really need to explain this? The VIPS are cringe in human form. But other than that, it might be one of the best shows ive ever watched."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"It starts very weird as the concept is quite abstract, the violence is sudden and spectacular and some of the acting is very OTT. However, the story is intriguing enough to keep you going and around the middle of the series it really finds its stride. One particular episode is truly heartbreaking and superbly well-shot and acted. Unfortunately, in a needless desire to force a 'shocking twist' into the ending, they up completely undermining that best episode in the show. It really left a sour taste at the end before the final episode just drifts on a bit and ends without much more happening.  Overall, glad I watched it but felt the last episode was a enormous let-down."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,I just imagined this type of game in my mind only but never thought it will become real in series. And this series plays so much with our feelings for example - we want both players alive but one has to die and it hurts so much. I loved and enjoyed this series so much but the last three episodes were hurtful. And VIPs ruined it because of what shitty acting had done the VIPs. I am happy with the ending because Season 2 of Squid games will be coming soon next year.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,4,,"If you've already watched Alice in Wonderland and As Gods will, you're gonna be disappointed.  The first 4 episodes were good, the plot was promising.  And then came the Second half, which felt rushed and the writers out of ideas.... The plot with the VIP was already seen many times and it felt awkward and ridiculous. And the rest was over dramatic and the ""plot twists""/reveals so typical... I felt like I've wasted my time with this series...."

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"I don't have words good enough to explain how much I liked this show. Absolutely brilliant presentation of the modern-day times and twisted values. I watched it three times already, and I just can't get enough. Never seen anything like this before. Breathtaking.  I understand lower ratings, tho. Squid Game is definitely not a show for people who are not yet ready to admit in what kind of world we are living. They will find it illogical, stupid, unnecessary finally. But the truth is that Squid Game is telling us what we all already know, but many are afraid to admit. We are all puppets, players in some other people's games."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"Squid game is a south Korean series that debuted to western audiences towards the end of 2021 and found massive success. The story follows our main character, a financially broken middle-aged man Seong Gi-hun. Through the fruit of his own actions, Seong is becoming more and more distant from his young daughter who he will forever lose contact with should he not get his life on track. The opportunity for him to become financially stable is presented to him in a colorful way, but will he take it? And what will the consequences be should he succeed?  Squid game is a breath of fresh air to the horror / thriller genre, not that it necessarily did anything new but it managed to tell a consistent story with many impact-full and emotional moments through out, without having to solely rely on gore and violence to captivate audiences. The characters are all fleshed out and have a personality of their own and are acted out brilliantly. I cannot stress enough the importance of the acting in this series. Without being too negative towards the English dub of squid game, the preferred way to watch this series is certainly in Korean with English subtitles. Without understanding a single word of Korean I was able to fully grasp every emotion that the characters conveyed and feel that nothing was lost in translation. The story has many twists and turns but maintains an easy path for the audience to follow and never becomes ridiculous, insultingly obvious or wastes your time as the viewer.  The series ends on a rather somber note and has left its self open for adaptation and continuation, which i heavily look forward to in the future and could see this series be pushed further into greatness.  Squid game is a very easy watch with a great story and enjoyable cast of characters, with both sweet moments and horrifying ones. It does have 1 or 2 more than silly moments, but in the grand scheme of the series they work fine and not every throw of the dart is a bullseye. If you are a fan of films such a Saw but would enjoy seeing a slightly more dramatized version (and in Korean!) then this series is certainly for you. 8/10."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"I watched the movie because I heard from my friend this movie was good. When I watched this movie for the first time, I really liked the story line. It makes me curious. I watched episode 1 - 9 in one night."

I found the acting great..just ignore the VIPS part lol..that passes fairly quickly anyway..otherwise some you may become fond of, it causes emotions to rise and fall, there is mystery, suspense, some comedy, but mostly it holds you on the edge to what will be next. Who is who..and so forth. I enjoyed so much I went on the hunt for another Korean show..im now enjoying (not as good as Squid in my eyes)Sweet Home. Highly recommend Squid."

Music was a bit annoying at times but it gave a lot of it tension that was really needed in all of the ""games"". The ending is incredible and I don't think there should be a season 2. I would love to see more tho. I feel like they didn't really think the show itself is going to get really popular so they ended it right there.  9/10 only thing that was bad were the VIPs. Would love to see more with the VIP plot etc."

They tried to do an American reboot of this one in the form of a reality series, but no one died on that show. LOL I didn't like it half as much as the real squid game.  These types of duel to the death aren't new, but squid game made it fun in the form of a game. There are other movies with this type of thing that I saw, and not all get it right. Squid game got it right because the characters were interesting and there was a lot of suspense  In terms of how it could be improved in a US reboot, I can only think of one thing, add a romance component, that would make it even more interesting."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"I have watched far more superior series and movies than this one . I felt like I wasted Nine hours for just a little fun.

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"This series is mind blowing. Fast paced thriller action, I haven't blink my eyes during whole series."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Squid Game is one of my favorite shows, not because of its shocking scenes or nail-biting tension (though, let's be real, there's plenty of that), but because it's so genius in how it holds up a mirror to society.  On the surface, it's a game-a twisted, life-or-death game, sure-but scratch just below and you realize it's a razor-sharp critique of capitalism, inequality, and the human desire to escape the suffocating grip of financial despair.  Each game is a metaphor, each character a reflection of someone you might pass by on the street, struggling in their own way.  The beauty of Squid Game isn't just in the thrills-it's in how it makes you uncomfortable, challenging the very system we live in while keeping you glued to the screen. It's like watching a high-stakes circus act while realizing, a bit too late, that the clowns are us.  So, yeah, it's as brutal as it sounds, but don't let that scare you off. The show's clever, yes, but also darkly funny in places, and it pulls you in with its characters' desperation. You get why they're playing these twisted games, but that doesn't mean you're not constantly questioning how far you'd go in their shoes.  It's an emotional rollercoaster, and trust me, you'll be hooked, even if you start to feel guilty for rooting for these flawed, sometimes very unlikeable characters. It's a must-watch for anyone who loves a bit of thrill and social critique with their binge-worthy TV."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"Squid Game is a gripping, brutal, and deeply emotional rollercoaster that redefines what survival dramas can be. The concept is wildly creative, but it's the execution - both visually and narratively - that makes it unforgettable. Every game raises the tension, and the social commentary hits hard without feeling forced.  The performances are outstanding, especially from Lee Jung-jae, who brings a grounded humanity to the chaos. The production design is surreal yet haunting, and the pacing keeps you hooked from start to finish.  It's not just a foreign-language hit - it's a global phenomenon for a reason. Squid Game earns its hype and stands as one of the best international shows ever made."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"Squid game serie was shot in a perfect angles, not even a single frame was shot in a noticeable error, direction was marvelous, casting is well selected, and yes i really loved the vip's characters, what do you want a serious straight personalities? Who is going to watch this games must be sick, pervert, unbalanced and full of sins.. So please stop reviewing based on personal imagination. 9/10 first Korean serie ever watched."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"I'm kind of blown away by this masterpiece. It does has it's flaws, mainly in the dubbing / subtitle area, but that's pretty common with asian movies. I guess it's next to impossible to do this 100% right. The series has awesome characters, not a single weak filler episode and many wtf moments. It's a fresh breeze in the world of Netflix' teenie action series that are basically unwatchable as soon as you are older than 25."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,Anyone who is bored of his/her life then please watch this show . If you are not happy with your life style then watch the life of the people who have lost everything in life and that's the same thing showed in this show and acting is so real . I just loved this show.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"Lots of hype. Entertaining because it's quirky and keeps you engaged, but not good enough to justify a high rating. High rating is clearly a marketing campaign."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Squid Game Ojing-eo Geimis a South Korean survival drama television series on Netflix created by Hwang Dong-hyuk, who wrote and directed all nine episodes. Its cast includes Lee Jung-jae, Park Hae-soo, Wi Ha-joon, Jung Ho-yeon, O Yeong-su, Heo Sung-tae, Anupam Tripathi, and Kim Joo-ryoung. The series revolves around a contest where 456 players in deep financial debt put their lives at risk to play a series of children's games for the chance to win a 45.6 billion a prize. The title of the series draws from a similarly named Korean children's game. Hwang had conceived of the idea based on his own economic struggles early in life as well as the class disparity in South Korea. Though he had initially written it in 2009, he was unable to find a production company to fund the idea until Netflix took an interest around 2019 as part of their drive to expand their foreign programming offerings."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"I'll give this series a high 6. A lot of clichés and familiar tropes collide here. I would definitely watch another series if it were offered though, as there are many avenues for this to go. If you're young, or don't watch a lot of movies/series, the hype is for you. Enjoy."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"Binged it all in two snow days. Gi hun is glued to the inside of my eyelids at this point  All these 8 star review are so harsh. Season two is not bad. I don't feel like the plot went in a bad direction like everyone is saying.  I also cried after season one. Which is definitely a strong reaction but it was so dang sad. You probably won't end up crying, I'm just emotional.  I don't know if this counts as a spoiler so I'll be super duper vague  There were some people in the cast who were celebrities and It made me so happy to see them in something mainstream.  So yeah. Awesome. Game of the squid. Go watch it. Unless you have a low blood tolerance. Then I definitely don't recommend you watching it. Other than that. Banger. What else are you gonna do. Read more IMDb reviews? No. Go watch squid game. I dare you. Just don't cry like me lol."

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"I absolutely love this show, the story is great, character development, and basically everything keeps you interested in it. I'd say the first 2 episodes aren't as good as the following 7, but that's part of the good stuff. There are many plot twists that blew my mind, and I will defo watch it again <3  Something that really made me ""cringe"" were the VIP's. Their scripts didn't feel natural enough and this is something that happens in almost every K-Drama or any Korean movie; they try and force Americans/foreigners in the movie and their scripting is just not good."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"So intense, so well crafted, so many meanings, dramatic, sadistic, emotional...television doesn't get much better than this."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"When Squid Game first hit our screens, it was a phenomenon-gritty, thought-provoking, and unforgettable. Yet somehow, Season 2 not only lives up to the colossal expectations but surpasses them, offering a richer, more complex narrative that elevates the series to new heights.  From the very first episode, Season 2 hooks you with its deeper exploration of human nature. It masterfully intertwines intense survival drama with nuanced character arcs, delving into the moral dilemmas and emotional struggles of returning favorites and intriguing new players. The stakes feel even higher, the twists more unpredictable, and the emotional impact more profound.  The world-building in Season 2 is a standout achievement. We're given a closer look at the mysterious Front Man and the inner workings of the deadly games, peeling back layers of the show's dystopian universe. The series doesn't just reuse the successful formula from Season 1; instead, it expands and innovates, creating fresh challenges that feel more sinister yet grounded in reality. The games are more complex, forcing contestants to grapple not just with physical threats but psychological warfare, making the viewing experience even more riveting.  Visually, Season 2 is a feast for the eyes. The production design is bolder, with surreal, nightmarish settings that amplify the tension. The use of color and symbolism remains as sharp as ever, giving fans plenty to dissect long after the credits roll.  The performances are exceptional. Lee Jung-jae's return as Gi-hun brings a deeply emotional resonance, showing a man scarred but determined. New cast members seamlessly integrate into the story, delivering standout performances that keep you emotionally invested in their fates.  Director Hwang Dong-hyuk proves once again that he is a master storyteller, balancing edge-of-your-seat suspense with moments of genuine humanity. The themes of inequality, greed, and desperation feel even more poignant, making this season not just a thrilling ride but a powerful social commentary.  If Season 1 was groundbreaking, Season 2 is a masterstroke. It takes everything fans loved about the original and raises the bar. With its compelling storytelling, intense drama, and shocking twists, Squid Game Season 2 proves that lightning can indeed strike twice-and even more powerfully."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"The peer pressure made me watch this. I wish this show came out about 10 years ago as some small part was predictable but was I surprised? Oh boy,I definitely was. Don't need a second season, but praise the creator and let him make more shows and movies. This was brilliant!"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"So hard to stop watching this crazy stupid show. Got to give it to the writers, it was so addictively captivating.  Set design was so good you'll be seeing every halloween costume this year look the same.  Episode 6 was by the far the peak of this series, an unbelievable conclusion to the previous 5 episodes. After that however, I can't say much... seemed to drift from the theme of fairness and equity among players which I really liked.  Definitely recommend this series. Even though some of the mysteries that were trying to be sneaky were quite apparent early on, it didn't take away from the excitement and stakes of the game.  (And something that I knew bothered many people was the atrocious acting by the American characters. Not sure if the problem was poor casting choices or some kind of language barrier, but damn, I can safely say for everyone- that part was hard to watch)"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Squid game 2 is kinda like 'the book of Boba fett'.. meaning it is kind of like a bridge between seasons, like Boba fett was to Mandalorian. Season 2 is like a bridge between 1 & and the final season 3. I was curious how the director would continue to keep up the suspence when the 'cat is already out of the box'! Season 1 already had too many twists and layers beneath that I was concerned that it would be hard to differentiate from the previous season.. Some of my concerns were correct.. but overall it was better than expected, somehow similar characters with sad backgrounds, and new traditional korean games introduced seemed kind of an echo from season 1. However, there were some additional twists that kept the new season 'fresh' and still kept me to the edge of the seat until the ending. I think it was a smart move of the director to shoot 2&3 simultaneously and ending it, because that means he has planned the entire storyline beforehand.. instead of continously producing serveral seasons with new contents for higher ratings, because that usually leads to nowhere and ruins the 1st season reputation eventually, like I have seen in several successful to bad series. (with the exception of breaking bad) Anyway, good work and definitely looking forward to the next and final season!"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,The show in itself is unique it's like a Last man standing type of game but in a korean way the worst thing about the show was the weird panther VIP hated him.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"It's often difficult for a Season 2 to live up to the expectations set by a hugely successful Season 1. That's why I started Squid Game Season 2 with low expectations. But wow, what a surprise! It seamlessly builds on the original series while delivering creative storytelling and outstanding ideas in each episode. The production quality is excellent, making it visually satisfying as well.  I really appreciate how the series features a stellar cast of Korea's renowned actors while also skillfully incorporating fresh faces. It does an excellent job of subtly weaving in themes like democracy, capitalism, and shamanism-issues that are currently significant not only in Korean society but also globally-without overdoing it.  Highly recommended!"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"My only complaint is that season 2 is clearly being split up into 2 parts. So annoying! Otherwise, the first half of season 2 was engrossing. I binged in one day. The new characters are great and dynamic. I was really impressed with how progressive the season is with a trans woman played by Lee Sung Hoon. The acting is just superb! Korean dramas to me are the absolute best! They really know how to pull your emotional strings with the characters they create and the acting, again is just stellar! I really love the twist in season 2 and how they are doing the plot this time. I just absolutely hate how Netflix split up the season. But it's so worth watching and I can hardly wait for the next half!"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"Lets kick this off with this, both seasons are good. The first one was really really good, and the second season was just really good. I love the concept behind the show. I remember really enjoying season one, and i just finished season 2. Season 2 started a little slow but then bam it kicks into full swing. I was literally on the edge of my seat almost yelling at my tv. I thoroughly enjoyed both season and cant wait for the next installment. This show provided quality entertainment, and i was enthralled the entire time. I'm not sure where the negative reviews are coming from, or what they expected, but this is 100% worth a watch."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"The first season was really good; it was my first series in this genre, and the beginning left an amazing impression on me.  However, the second season disappointed me-it felt like they didn't take it seriously. The characters seem like copies of those from the first season, and the script feels like it was made for TikTok edits to appeal to the audience.  It's no longer interesting knowing that everyone except for one character will die. They focused way too much on the main character.  The game creator entering the game turned out to be pointless-realistically, everyone knows the creator wouldn't participate, at least not in such a foolish way. Also, the main character wouldn't trust everyone so easily after everything they had been through."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"There are people who have watched this series and are happy with it because it entertained them. But we are a few who have seen how many opportunities they have left behind. They could have brought a lot more out of it, instead of a grotesque mindless murdering."

It's incredibly rare for a show to have a breakthrough premise, originality, amazing character development and brilliant all round delivery...

I don't want to appear picky or academic, but my wife and friends, after watching this series and then watching Liar Game, Alice in Borderland, and similar shows, all commented that Squid Game is really bad; some even said it's trash.

We learn more about the mysterious organization behind the games and the driving forces of its leaders, adding layers of intrigue and emotional engagement.  The screenplay masterfully balances personal dramas with moral dilemmas. The cast delivers outstanding performances, especially the protagonist, who struggles to resist the system. The new challenges are original and even more brutal, highlighting the absurdity and tragedy of the events.  Visually, the series remains stunning: the sets, color palettes, and cinematography create a unique aesthetic that has become the show's hallmark. The musical score amplifies the tension and makes emotionally charged moments even more memorable.  The only drawback is that some parts of the story feel a bit stretched, and a few subplots come across as secondary. However, this doesn't significantly detract from the overall experience, as the show's message retains its relevance and impact."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,,,"Squid Game is an enjoyable and visually pleasing show, but it's definitely not a ""good"" show. It's no different from any other generic thriller made by C-grade directors who never made a movie with a score higher than 6. Being a true follower of this genre, Squid Game made most of the same mistakes such movies usually make: too many plot holes, illogical and poorly thought out scenes, unfairly manipulating people's emotions for shock value, etc. However, the show manages to do one thing most other ""bad"" movies never accomplished, and that's shamelessly manipulate the viewer's emotions for cheap tear-jerking moments, that despite being unbelievably predictable (such as most things in this movie), still manage to affect many people.  To be fair, I was actually quite surprised when I found out that the director/writer of the show, Hwang Dong-hyuk, presumably worked on this script for years. It looks like something an inexperienced film-maker who never attended a filmmaking school would make. It seems like he simply took bits he liked and that worked well in other movies, and decided to combine them into one tv show. The thing is, this constant jump from one bit to another, stripped the show from any meaning. It's an extremely superficial show which tries very hard to be deeper than it is. Though I wouldn't hold it against this show, even though it makes me laugh whenever the director is mad when someone is criticizing his talentless piece of work.  With that being said, there's nothing wrong about it not being a good show as long as it's enjoyable, and it definitely is. The difference is that despite liking it, I won't put it among the good movies I like, but rather with the other bunch, where you can find movies such as the Saw and various action-driven movies - bad but fun."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"S2 is not as good as the first season and the immersion gets broken by some of the writing. In general there are some good ideas but some of them are poorly executed. As others have said the voice acting isnt great but its the logic of some of the plots that dont really work and the reasons for why a character behaved in a certain way are over explained to the audience. Without adding any spoilers, a character for example might say ""thats why I did such a thing"" and another character joins in with ""oh yea thats my reason too!"". If the actions characters take are reasonable, the audience will there by themselves without the need for the character handbook.  So its not bad but neither is it smart."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"Is this show art or sadistic hype? Or just criticism of capitalism? The cynical display of social injustice in Squid Game is not a pose. The South Korean screenwriter and director Hwang Dong-hyuk came up with the idea for the series during the 2008 financial crisis - brutally and directly.  The series is a criticism of the world as it is. A double-edged sword. The protagonist Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae) - an unemployed chauffeur who slipped into gambling addiction after losing his job - depends not only on the prize money to gain custody of his daughter, but also to one to pay for an important operation for his mother. He becomes part of a show for life and death.  A mass extinction staged by Netflix. Is this good or bad? You can look at it, even if a lot is reminiscent of Stephen King."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,Honestly Netflix can not make many good American shows without a bunch of woke politics and other trash. This show is god damn amazing!!! Its so dark and twisted.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"It's an okay series, but I really don't think it's hypeworthy. Most, if not all, elements of the series have been there before, but better. Only distinguishing feature is that it's korean.  What really bothered me was: Overacting a lot of times. Or is that just a cultural thing?  Cringeworthy dialogues from all people involved (especially the bad guys).  Certain storylines just fizzle out into nothingness. What's the purpose of having them then?"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"Solid drama with good story complexity and excellent character build up. Each episode is thrilling and heartwarming. Awesome series, one of the best series i have seen so far on netflix. Looking forward for Season 2."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Absolutely love the show!! Great work with both seasons, it really kept me on the edge most of the time and the cliffhanger in S2 made me mad (in a good way). Love the characters and the cast is perfect, the producer truly does an amazing job. Can't wait for S3 to see how the story ends.  I recommend this show 110%, because it's simply just a great show. The storyline, the cast in both seasons, the games, just everything that happens and how they make you wanting more. This is a show you wanna rewatch over and over again, because that's how good it is and it doesn't matter if you know how the story goes."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,You love characters who are good and you actually hate those who are bad. It's that good. Ignore the VIP!!!!
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,This Is another Netflix Master Piece Web Series egarly waiting for next season.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,Seriously?8.3?  The ending is absolutely illogical.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,One of best series I have ever watched. The story is so simple but effective and extraordinary. The games are so relatable yet bloody dangerous. That old man is the heart of this story. There are lots of things you can relate in your daily life with this story. Outstanding.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"I didn't have any expectations as I hadn't read or heard any reviews of the show. I've seen the show pop up every day on my Netflix page and I'm glad I ended up watching it. The stage set, the storyline shows another level of creativeness which is rare nowadays. All in all great show, in my opinion it would be best for it to leave it as it is, without a second season..."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,Everyone gave their best except for the VIPS.  Great series to watch Hats off to the director!
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"With all the hype around it I was very interested in this series, but found myself somewhat disappointed. Yes, it is interesting enough to keep watching, but actually it is not that special. Yes there are some interesting plot twists but again, not really shocking. It is all a basic conflict of bonding with people that all go for the money, where apparently our hero is the only one with some moral feelings. The storyline with the detective did not add much and the VIPs were silly. The gangster is very stereotype and silly.  There is a uprising in Korean series, this one is ok, but not special. ""Memories of the Alhambra"" and ""Sysiphus"" are much more intelligent in their script.  The popularity caused a season 2, which is really sofar a waste of time to watch. Acting and dialogues are silly as are some of the very basic characters. I was fast forwarding most of the episodes."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"I really really enjoyed this. The acting from the Korean actors was incredible, all of them were brilliant and so believable. All the interactions between the players in the early games were so great, especially Gi-Hun, Ming-Wae and Sang-Woo. Yes the English actors were crap but it didn't really detract from it, if anything it made them more creepy and added to the atmosphere that they saw themselves as Gods.  Don't want to spoil it but honestly it's so worth a watch. As awful as it is, it highlights the terrible things that possibly happen in the world."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"I think if I spoke Korean and could watch this without it being dubbed, I would probably love it and give it at least 9 starts. But the dubbing is bad and the dialogue is amateurish. I'm guessing they have to make the English words fit the time frame of the actor's mouths moving and maybe because of that it is not a direct translation and that is why it is often so bad. But beyond that, the voice actors doing the dubbing are often pretty flat in their delivery. So while this is an intriguing watch, it is marred by the voice actors doing the dubbing (and the writers who I think could have done better with the dialogue)."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"This is our society.  If you want to see a nice series, choose it.  This film is full of meaning and concept of our current society in which we live. We are all in some kind of bad situation like this."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Honestly, I'm pretty squeamish and was hesitant to watch this series though my god only after 1 episode I was instantly hooked. Amazing cinamatografy and writing although it occasionally felt a little too gloomy (to a point it might seem a little too unrealistic) it was certainly one of the best shows I've watched in a long time. I can't emphasize enough that this show is a series worth watching. (Though only teens and up I genuinly think it would be traumatizing for a child to watch this)"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,No doubt it is a one of the Best web Series. I recommend everyone to watch this.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"I am not one to follow the hype train usually but I just finished watching this and I have to say if you haven't seen this one then you're missing out! The way it grips you from the very start and doesn't let go is something to be applauded. Without spoiling anything all I can talk about is how the show made me feel... it is brutal and I am not talking about the violence. Part psychological drama, part social commentary and filled with twists and turns this one is not one to miss!"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,,,"Awesome.  VIPs tho, so dumb. Horrible voices, line delivery, and acting. Would have been better if they said nothing at all. It was like they were all doing bugs bunny impersonations. Horrible."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"The acting is terrible, the English translation deserves jail time. Choosing Ho Yeon Yung to star was brilliant because even if she can't act her face is enigmatic despite not having a single emotion on her face. The cosplay Korean BS is so over the top it's like watching Batman from the sixties. It is just another example of stupidification of the masses willing to eat what is shoveled out."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"If you can get past the dubbing, this is a brilliant nail biter...unlike anything I have seen before...I would HIGHLY recommend."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"Squid Game is a unique take on the death game genre which got so popular thanks to progenitors such as Battle Royale and the Hunger Games. Basing the challenge on kids playground games is just a great concept and it's easy to see why it became so popular.  Where Squid Game really shines, and why I think it got so much buzz during it's first season run in 2021 was due to its incredible set and costume design. The participants, their captors, and the game rooms are all so memorable and really jump into your minds eye thanks to their bold colours and simple iconography.  The plot in general is also pretty engaging as you follow a small group trying to play these games and work out what's going on behind the scenes. The acting (particularly from the 3 main leads) is also pretty good with some great emotional moments which are really delivered well considering most characters were sadly underbaked.  Where Squid Game falls apart is the sheer number of plot holes and inconsistencies. I want to forgive the show for it's sins but they just kept adding up, and by the end the suspension of belief becomes too ridiculous. It had me for the first 6 episodes (and 6 really is the peak), but the final 3 really lost me. The writers seemed to be more interested in making shocking plot developments rather than well-written, developed and interesting characters.  Some tighter and more focused writing with something actually interesting to say would've made this show so much better. I won't even mention the VIPs - everything about them was just terrible.  Here's hoping the second season can win me back."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"That's the best thing about streaming services. Without them we would never watch a series like that! This was my first Korean series I ever watched and I'm pretty sure it won't be the last. Keep them coming on netflix! We need more countries to get the opportunity to show they can provide us with something worth watching! The show was great, the acting was amazing and unlike most battle royale types of shows i've seen, i actually cared for many characters! I loved it, i enjoyed every minute of it and i'm surely coming back at a possible second season."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"I feel like this is one of those shows that went viral and it's not entirely clear why. The show is good, but nothing so exceptional that it deserves this kind of attention. In my opinion the actors, sound and cinematography are all great and I enjoyed their delivery.  The writing on the other hand, is a pretty mixed bag. For example, the show's only subplot (that gets may 20-30% of screentime) has no impact on the main plot and then later resolves itself with a really underwhelming twist. Why did they even bother including it? In general, there are too many senseless twists towards the end that lessen the characters and series.  Then there's the rather cliché ""rich people pitting poor people against each other"" setting. They make the rich villains so cartoonishly evil, that I can't take them seriously. Especially their ""69"" jokes sound like they were written by a 12-year old on 9GAG.  My gripes with the writing aside, I think it was still an interesting watch. There are also some really obvious hints that the show is looking to make a sequel, so maybe the creators can write something more nuanced then."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,It's super dark and intriguing and shows the lengths different humans will go out of greed. Messed with me a lot though sheesh.

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"I'm not into Korean movies, but I actually binge watched this one. No way to stop until the end. Every episode is a crescendo, until the end.  Now, season 2 is as gripping, BUT, the ending is kind of funny. I was expecting more, or at least a decent cliffhanger."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"I have to say after watching the trailer, I immediately saved this series to my watch list and could not wait until it is out.  However, maybe due to my high expectation I was quite disappointed after finishing the 1st season on one run. Believe me, I'm a sucker for this kind of genre so I'm looking for interesting plot, great games and unpredictable twists. If you're the same as me, the series will not deliver these. I found some parts are redundant with unnecessary overacting, I had to skip plenty times. The plot is quite boring for me compared to other survival-game series. But, I cannot deny the cinematography is great.  If you have some time to kill, it still brings you some entertainment. Keep your expectation lower to enjoy it more if possible."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"I found the beginning of the first episode to be extremely slow paced and I instantly disliked the main character I was seconds from turning it off and giving up on this show but then finally...... bam! It gets interesting and extremely bloody and thrilling and I couldn't stop watching and found myself often wondering what I would do if in their situation. The main character became less annoying and I eventually grew to enjoy him as a character and really rooting for him. I actually guessed the twist very earliest but enjoyed it none the less. Do not watch it you can't stand senseless violence, blood or are squeamish."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"This is what Takeshi's Castle would have been if Sam Peckinpah or Quentin Tarantino had been in charge. An entertaining concept, with loads of bloodshed. What else do you need?"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"The show started good gor the couole of episodes but began to downgrade at the endings. The VIPs were awfully bad and full of cringe dialogue of 9 year olds. As for the main lead actor of the show, he was not good in any aspect. The Pakistani guy was more likable than him. Except for one episode I don't think there is any scene in which the main lead actor is useful."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,1,,"Season 1 is epic and unique. Season 2 and Season 3 can be in the same season. Season 3 is exggerated every time you see Gi-hun. He is ""the extender"" of the season. He made things ridiculously complicated for moral and his superheroism. I wished I had not seen season 2 and 3. Only season 1 is good.  Season 2 is sort of action thrilling and somewhat dramatic. And season 3 could fit into season 2 with a few more episodes. No need for season 3 if it turns out like this.  Season 3 is deep dramatic and becomes moralistic and superheroism. The final scene is somewhat non-realistic at all. The front man wait that long to show up in front of the baby that has now turned teenage. Just to give a memorable set of gift from adopting father."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"This is my first Korean series, I was excited watching each episode, it was seat edge thriller undoubtedly. A thriller roaler coaster ride. Episodes can't makes you up from sitting while watching this."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"This is everything you want from a TV-Series. Drama, Thriller, Entertainment, good acting for a TV series and of course very good storyline.  The Koreans never seem to disappoint when it comes to Drama/Thrillers. There's always something you don't expect that happens at some time in the movie/series that you just are left speechless.  If Wes Anderson would have made a Thriller Tv Series, I think it would've pretty much looked like this one, haha. I liked the cameras, the scenes where it looks like an animation movie (e.g. The stairs), and most of all the symmetry.  The actors who play the VIPs are extremely bad at acting. I mean, what the hell? A show this great, ruined by only 4-5 bad secondary actors.  All in all, I would give 9 out of 10 to this amazing production. Would recommend to anyone."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"I'm Korean, and people around me kept telling me to watch this show so I decided to try it. Definitely exceeded my expectations. It brought much more emotional attachment that many Western shows, and I liked how the show wasn't very predictable. For example, I loved OBX but it felt a little repetitive to the point I started watching it more for the characters than the plot itself. However, this show really did well in terms of both the character development and plot.  Also, I've seen reviews saying the Netflix subtitles were inaccurate. But idk, I thought it was well written (as a bilingual person) I loved the dubbings too bc the voices really matched.  Lastly, to address the VIP scene, many people said they were poor actors and had cringe lines.  I think the lines embodied the American culture pretty well for a Korean crew. At this point, yall should be thankful it wasn't worse. Also, since not a lot of foreigners live in Korea, it would have been difficult to pick up actual actors for the show."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,,,"Wow what a show! I watched with my fiance who also hates dubbed over films, it's too distracting, HOWEVER, Squid Game is SO worth it!! I'd even watch it again.

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"I've never watched a series like this before. From the characters behavior's stand due the game time to pains in their civil life is effect your brain in the existential sense way. They show us mankind could do everything for some stupid piece of paper with a small games that we played in our childhood. On the other hand as the games progress, you witness other games played behind the scenes and the taste of the series starts to get better. Omg! I don't want to give you spoiler! Just watch it. I hope the second season will airs."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,4,,"They stopped trying. Season one was very well made, with good character development and a strong plot. 8/10. I'm still in shock. How could season two be this bad? 5/10. The characters are silly, the music is silly, the games are dumb and boring. Did they decide the first season was too violent? Wasn't that what kept people watching? Season two so much talking, wasting time nothing happening. Seems like they decided to rush this season, only seven episodes. Why would you rush a show that had done so well the first season? Netflix shows end up being so disappointing. They either cancel the good ones or ruin them. Most disappointing show of 2024."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"Squid Game is great show and worth the hype it gained on social media. The ending, however, was a bit of a let down and also confusing. It's very gory, and violently gruesome, so not suitable for sensitive viewers."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"A few months have passed since the Squid Game hype. I still can't forget the intensity and the stories in the Squid Game.

I think every viewer finds one's self in the show that he/ she feels most attached to."

I've recently seen it compared to Alice In Borderland and I must say Squid Game is far superior for the storyline, character development and eerie message of what lengths human beings will go to for money when feeling desperate.  The only moment I questioned the show was during the first half of episode 2 which slowed down a bit but picked up again within the second half.  After that I was glued to it and by the end I was left hoping for a season 2."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"This show is so good, every episode is gonna have you standing up from your chair and will hook you.

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,1,,"Season one was great, season two was so bad I don't even know where to begin. The absolutely best thing about season 2 was- it was short.  Talk about trying to cash in by dragging things out. People shouldn't take my word for it, they should watch the first 2 episodes to get a feel for how horrible it is- then believe me when I say this- those were the 2 'best' episodes.  Season 2 really tarnishes 1. The person claiming they stole his idea to make the first should point to season two in court as proof because it's hard to believe they were created by the same person.  So, so bad. Worse than bad. Is it a spoiler to tell the world it sucked?"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"I can't say this is a ""spoiler alert"" because everyone else is harping on the subject.  Many people reviewing this series are hung up on how well the ""VIPs"" can act. Think of it another way, can they just be ordinary people whom just come on for a ""guest"" appearance? Do they actually have to act?  Remember the ""rich"" people of the world are self centered and don't really care if one is injured or not. Why would they want to have lines that actually mean something?"

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"(Review updated after Season 2).  Seong Gi-hun is a gambling addict and owes a large amount to an unscrupulous loan shark. His addiction has wrecked his marriage and means he rarely sees his daughter. When a stranger offers him an opportunity to play a game that will potentially see his debts erased, he jumps at the opportunity. Little does he realise how deadly the game is.  A highly entertaining and riveting Season 1, and surprisingly so. I knew the series was about a game to the death for a prize but on the surface the plot seemed quite one-dimensional. Furthermore, the series doesn't start very well: the character sketching of the main character seems overly elaborate, there is a predictability with regard to where things are going and much of the first two episodes seems like filler.  However, from a point things click into gear. No more filler as the games are revealed and played out, involving some intense action scenes and intriguing outcomes. Hardly one-dimensional: we get to know the characters, get to like some of them and be personally invested in their survival. Some of the games then pit our favourite characters against each other, making things even more intriguing and engaging. Some great sub-plots.  Quite unpredictable too and teasingly so as the plot sets you up for an unoriginal development only for a great twist to occur. Highly interesting, engaging and entertaining.  Season 1 ended in such a way to suggest there would be a Season 2 and there is. I would have preferred that this is a mini-series, i.e. Single season, but it did seem intriguingly set up so didn't mind too much that it was continuing.  However, while reasonably entertaining, Season 2 is not in the same league as S1. It starts badly enough with a random, more style-than-substance goose chase and weak, irritating secondary characters. Things do find a focus but from a point S2 resembles S1 to a large extent, making it feel predictable and unoriginal. Add in more irritating, badly played characters and it's not very engaging either.  Season ratings: S1 8/10, S2 6/10."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,2,,"Nothing more than a Korean version of hunger game with some cheap metaphors to criticize capitalism, democracy, ethics etc. Terrible acting, cliche dialogues and predictable scenes that drag for minutes and minutes.

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,Firstly no spoilers here.  I don't recommend you watch the dub. It's very distracting and can take away the seriousness of the show at times.  Its so good. So amazing. Loved it to pieces. Each episode left me wanting more. But then to keep from going through the show too quick I limited myself to two episodes a day.  Totally worth it as waiting 24 hours between every 2 episodes really added to the suspense of the show.  Highly recommend.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"This third season gives us an ideal ending with a plot that, despite being difficult to keep hooked, generates moments of warmth and also tension, violence and crudeness, more than once it will make you feel identified with a character, their story or some behavior, in some moments the characters tried to spin very fine in their interpretation and that could confuse your perception of what will happen or not, it will remain a mystery if it was intentional or a weakness in the direction, an ending worth remembering and a concept that will continue to be popular for several years, is what Netflix and Korea offered us with this installment."

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"It's a good series. Is it as good as Alice in Borderland, not really, this one, while having more realistic qualities, is basically that series meets Parasite with a light flavoring of Saw series. Outside of the main character there isn't much in the way of an engaging cast. In fact towards the end of the series you're rooting against most of them. The side story was particularly laboring and disengaging. The theming is little too blatant and bordering on sophomoric. It's really just not that clever, despite the hype. It is a good series, and of course being a K series social and economic injustice is deeply threaded into the theme.

Seong Gi-hun, having rejected a new life in the United States, chooses instead to return to the games, driven by a desire to uncover their hidden truths. This decision imbues the narrative with a deeper emotional undercurrent, offering a glimpse into Gi-hun's inner turmoil. However, as the games resume, the familiarity of the rules and structure quickly dulls the emotional tension.  The second season leans heavily on the framework of the first, with only slight variations in game design and plot progression. This reliance creates a sense of déjà vu, where the novelty and unpredictability of the first season are replaced by a formulaic repetition. The interludes between games, particularly the voting sequences, feel like unnecessary padding, lacking the moral gravity they once carried. Instead of advancing the narrative, they stretch it thin, leaving the pacing sluggish and uninspired.  Characters and Plot: Depth or Redundancy?  Season two aspires to delve deeper into its characters and the mysteries behind the games. Gi-hun's personal quest, the machinations of the game's organizers, and the backstories of new participants all aim to enrich the narrative. Yet, this attempt at depth often falters in execution. The dialogue is overly simplistic and lacks nuance, while the interactions between characters fail to evoke the complexity or emotional resonance they seem intended to convey.  The return of familiar faces from the first season further diminishes the sense of uncertainty and danger that defined the original. With the audience already acquainted with these characters, their actions and decisions become increasingly predictable. This foreknowledge robs the games of their suspense, reducing even the most violent or dramatic moments to hollow echoes of the past.  Suspense and Repetition: Between Loss and Renewal Despite its flaws, the second season does manage to offer glimpses of intrigue. The opening episode, with its distinct departure from the first season's structure, sets the stage for Gi-hun's journey of discovery. His determination to uncover the truth behind the games introduces a broader theme of resistance and agency. The reappearance of the mysterious Front Man, now participating as Player 001, adds a layer of complexity to the narrative, hinting at deeper conspiracies.  The season also attempts to expand the scope of the story, exploring the larger forces that sustain the games. Questions about their origins, purpose, and mechanics linger throughout, laying the groundwork for the upcoming third season. While these mysteries remain largely unresolved, they hint at a more expansive world and a potentially richer narrative to come.  Conclusion: Echoes of the Past, Glimpses of the Future Squid Game Season 2 strives to build upon the success of its predecessor, aiming to deepen its characters and expand its mythos. Yet, its heavy reliance on the established formula undermines its efforts, leading to a sense of redundancy. While the violence and moral dilemmas remain gripping, the lack of fresh ideas in game design and storytelling diminishes the tension and excitement that once defined the series.  Nevertheless, the season sets the stage for an intriguing third installment. Gi-hun's journey, the secrets of the games, and the exploration of human nature under extreme conditions continue to be the heart of Squid Game. If this season serves as a transitional chapter, then the true climax may lie ahead, waiting to unfold in the final act."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,1,,"If you have not watched season 1, it's great within it's genre- truly unique. Stop there and don't be fooled into thinking they found a way to continue the story line in a decent way.  Season 2 is very bad, just in almost every way. The word milking, as used by many people, is spot on. The director even admitted he just made the second and third season for the money, his own words. (Mind you, they clearly shot the second and third season continuously, it's just another part of the milking machine) However season 3 is just laughable. The amount of bad and unbelievable choices script wise, utterly poor directing and horribly cringe western actors (the vips) makes it unwatchable. But of course I had to finish it, all the while jamming a fist in my mouth to stop me from screaming in agony.  It's almost as if they tried their hardest to prove one does not need the suspension of disbelieve. No need to list the reasons if you are still going to watch, as you will see for yourself. No need to list them if you're not watching, you would not understand the utter ridiculousness anyway."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"FOR those who are confused whether to watch the show or not: 1. First of all the the vip acting or their role in the show does not matter that much so do not stop yourself from watching due to them 2. The show is not disturbing(2-3 scenes you may find it disturbing) 3.the background music is good overall the show is cool, it is sort of like escape room only there is no escaping so if you like such type then you should definitely give it a shot."

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Just as the title reads. This series is an emotional ride on every single level, and I believe there is so much an actor can convey in a scene that transcends language. After finishing the series I checked out the English dubbed version and it was painful to watch; all of that powerful tone, inflection, emotion - gone and replaced by poorly-acted robotic American voices. These actors are extremely talented and you deserve to experience their performance to the fullest extent possible. Watch the Korean version - it will enrich your viewing experience greatly.  The hype around this show was so intense that I went in assuming my expectations wouldn't be met - and they were far exceeded. It's difficult for me to put into words how fantastic I thought this series was, but it wow'ed me on every level. The sets are absolutely mesmerizing, the score is haunting, the acting is superb, the characters are flawed and complex, and the storyline(s) are very well thought-out. I keep finding myself returning to Netflix/YouTube to rewatch scenes from the show because they struck me so deeply. I hope for a 2nd season, I'd love to watch regardless of which direction it goes in!! Absolutely mind blowing show.  I would use caution if you are sensitive to death & violence. Even if you're not terribly sensitive either, to be honest. This show doesn't hold back!"

The characters that you love are killed one after the other and these scenes will break your heart into pieces(Especially season 3). The last phase of the series can be become more good. The last game of the series should be built more intense. Overall this series is wonderful . I cry so much while watching this series and my heart torn into pieces,that I never felt before while watching such series. If you are real fan of squid game,you will definitely gonna cry while watching this series .This series starts well and ends well. Squid game is both disturbing and addictive series, leaving a lasting impression. This story reveals the moral cost of greed."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"POSITIVES :-  First, the CONNECTIONS between two characters are plotted so nice.  Second, the STORY PLOTTING is also good except in episode 2.  Third, the BGM also performed his work amazingly. It supported the visuals so nicely.  Fourth, ACTING done by each character is very natural.  Fifth, i love the INNOCENCE shown in movie, specially of two characters - main character and that old man.  Sixth, as i wrote in title, CINEMATOGRAPHY is lifeline of this movie. I am unable to describe it.  Seventh, the SETS are also amazing, i like the place where those games held.  Eighth, i love the GORE SCENES that are shown in the movie, specially that first kill in the first game. Omg, that gave me so pleasure.  Ninth, the CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT is also good.  NEGATIVES:-  First, the STORY of the movie is so WEAK & PREDICTABLE. The story is said to be the soul of any series. But squid doesn't focus on this.  Second, i know that the series doesn't kill its main character, so we already know the game results from the beginning that the main character doesn't lose. Still series stretch the length of the game unnecessarily.  Third, there are so many FILLER SCENES which can be easily removed.  Fourth, plotting of DEATHS are not so Impactful. I can't feel anything.  Fifth, it is so DRAMATICAL in some episodes. And i don't like drama so much.  Sixth, the last episode gives me so much irritation because i expected that all the mysteries were solved in this episode. But this web series doesn't give a satisfying explanation of the game like who is the owner or head behind this, and why did they do it and how it can be hidden from all governments of the world etc.  That's all from my side."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,,,"There is no new plot in Squid Game. It follows a conventional framework to guide its audience until it becomes predictable enough for viewers to know what will happen next. It is just a Korean version on ""The Hunger Games"" or ""Escape Room"" with a formulaic plot, and characters whose destinies have been predetermined from the start. The show's twists were predictable and unworthy of the extreme hype.  However, there are three applaudable facet of the movie: the performances, the design and the soundtrack."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"This series is just another average one. Nothing less nothing more!  And I am explaining:  1) NOT original at all. Several movies had as the main idea a game of life and death. Also a recent Japanese series (Alice in borderland) has almost the exact same idea.  2) totally predictable even for a six years old.  3) Overdramatic without any reason using of course too much of the respective music.  4) The acting was almost ridiculous and almost making you laugh instead of feeling what the creator thought you should feel.  AND PEOPLE for god sake don't fall for marketing tricks, promotions and trendy stuff.  There are so many more (countless) shows and series way much better than this that deserve your time. STOP being sheep and just doing something just because is viral.  And i am saying all these after i have watched about 200-300 TV shows and Series and countless movies and not only that trendy ones!

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"My kids on my back to watch it, so watched first episode, bit over the top for me and didn't think much of the first episode, but then watched the second and I got hooked, watched the whole series, this not perfect but bloody close, it got me in and I enjoyed the first season allot so much I'm watching it again. I can see why it is so popular and now I have to wait for second season. Really worth watching but warning allot of blood and gore."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"For me the dubbing was a distraction, some of the voiceovers were awful.  Certainly one of the most hyped shows of the year but despite a few exciting parts it was on the whole flat and lacking."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,1,,"The show does not live up to the hype.  It's ok, but not as spectacular as the hype would indicate. I preferred alice in borderland over squid games. Now they are pushing for season 2, and I am guarantee you, season 2 gonna fail - big time! Mark my words."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"Really enjoyed this Korean series, It's like Takashi's Castle with a story and severe consequences full of gore, violent and twists and holds no punches which is what I've come to expect from Korean series/movies. The only only criticism is that the VIP's acting was awful and I hope if a 2nd series is made they get rid of the English speaking actors. I've also watched Alice in Borderland which was good but this is better and more interesting. I would recommend this series and hope there is a second. If you enjoyed this, watch Battle Royale the ""Hunger games"" superior original."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"Excellent Korean TV Series and what a great performance from the actors and actresses! The VIPs weren't that good, but it didn't effect how much I enjoyed the series.  Very well made with lots of nail biting moments. I can't wait to see the next season!"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Just binged watched 4 episodes in a row. Amazing!  Extraordinarily original and fresh. There are some feelings of Old Boy, Parasite and Japan's Battle Royale, and of course hints of Black Mirror (the title graphics make that very clear) - but overall the production style and content is incredibly fresh.  It's best to go in without knowing much about it and just let it tell the story.  I see a few here complaining about VIP acting, I have no clue what that is, but I found the acting overall very good.  I don't speak Korean, so maybe they sensed more than me.  Since it's mainly a character study, elements of the hapless yet hopeful fool (the main character) and stereotypical thug (the main antagonist) obviously exist to narrate the story as it progresses.  Let's face it, if this was just outright brutality that would be very off-putting and just become an average SAW-type horror story, this is clearly not the intention here. Subtle messaging abounds. For your consideration.  The design of the production varies from the bleak harshness of the outside world to the colourful Escher and Minecraft inspired world of the childish game itself.  With Star Wars like drone soldiers mindlessly ensuring the players stay in line. Under a hierarchy based on shapes and a Vader-like controller that keeps you wondering what exactly the entire situation is about.  And that's where the Old Boy feeling really kicks in. Is this controller seeking revenge from some childhood slight or is it intended as a learning experience?  Overall, I would just suggest watching episode 1 and if you get hooked like me, then you've found something you will absolutely love.  Can't really say any more until I'm done watching it all.  But I'm going to take a break because binge watching is a crime.  Or it should be. Especially given the work gone into this.  Thanks for reading."

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"There was a new Korean series on Netflix and I didn't really care. But it didn't take long before I started hearing about it from all sides, and only in a good way. So I decided to watch this series and I don't regret it at all. The 1st episode introduced us to the main character, who I thought was awesome. Overall, all the contestants here had something going for them and each character was interesting to me in some way. The 2nd episode was the worst for me. But from the 3rd episode onwards, it picked up the pace and I couldn't take my eyes off the screen and it started to get quite suspenseful. As I mentioned, I found every character interesting, so I was always interested to see who would die and how it would all turn out. The games were fun, interesting, and overall the idea of grown people playing children's games seemed original to me. Other than that, as I mentioned I really enjoyed myself and each game had something to it. What also pulled the series for me was the overall interestingness and mystery. There are actually a few unexpected moments. Except for perhaps one thing, I didn't anticipate anything and the series kept surprising me. To sum it all up. I think Ojingeo geim is an amazing series and I recommend it."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"The show got popular thanks to the strength of the first few episodes but the story, acting and plot all take a nosedive as the series progresses.

Very average show but that's generally what you can expect from gore porn television/movies/etc."

By the time the show is over you're left with a strange taste in ur mouth, mostly because the protagonist makes some very stupid choices that make no sense, this dude just keeps testing his luck assuming it will never run out. Anyways, this show runs back and forth from the depths of human depravity to the better angels of our nature. Definitely worth watching."

Season 3 scored only 0/10. Completely disappointing - darkness for the sake of darkness, all characters killed off, and a hopeless finale.  Instead of a proper conclusion, it just destroys everything that was built. Emotionally draining with no meaning left.  Feels like the creator didn't care about the viewers or the story anymore.  Season 3 nullified the value of season 2, and with it, the entire franchise.  It would have been better without it."

Not everything it is what seems in this drama."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,This show is very deep and meaningful. There's life lessons you can learn from watching this. It's suspenseful and gruesome. I finished 9 episodes in 2 days and almost dislocated my jaw. Loved it and hoping for Season 2!

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"!!! UNPOPULAR OPINION !!! - no spoilers  Like many things nowadays, this show was hyped to hell. Any objective opinion doesn't matter any more. If « they » tell you it's amazing, then you're going to « think » it's amazing. It's not.  Squid Game is far from ""amazing"".  The show actually starts really well, with an interesting approach to anti capitalism, and a strong visual language. But there are just so many writing inconsistencies that it's impossible to take it seriously, and it pulled me out of the experience. There are countless situations where things feel unnatural, forced, specially near the ending. Other things just don't make sense, like the main character's choice at the end. The last episodes feel unfinished, unpolished, and underwhelming.  And the ending...omg. Botched to hell. The final twist is so idiotic, so so lazy... « Let's make a shocking twist ! » - the writers must've thought... Boring.  However, Squid Game was still fun to watch, with strong moments here and there. But is it up the hype ? Absolutely not.  Ultimately, the show tries too hard to be special, and in doing so, it fails to be coherent.  It's basically Westworld, but much worse, and for teenagers.  Sorry..."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"This show is amazing, episode six was so great. Probably one of the best tv show episodes I have ever seen. But I kind of did not love the end of the show.

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"The more I hate to admit but the ending of the 3rd Season really made this series a 10/10. I don't know why people deducted the rating of the series due to the VIPs' poor acting (I was't even focused on them for the most time neither was the story). Nothing is perfect, but Squid Game is on of the pieces of media that's nearest to perfection. Watch it yourself I am not going to spoil it for you but I promise you won't regret."

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"Let me keep it straight.  Squid Game has a better cinematography (see the color contrast!!!) but Alice in the Borderland is way darker (n thus better, personally) as a thriller and horror series. I dunno why but Japanese directors are more capable of creating stunning gore effects and death/necro scenes. Which is to say, If u can't stand the horror and jump-scare of Alice in the Borderland, then Squid Game is the one more u. It is visually mild in every aspects, plus a warmer story to make u feel easier.  Back to Squid Game, I think it's not something original and groundbreaking. As a survival horror series it is too warm, too humane. The baddies are not that bad (at all!!). Finally, why there is always a super clean-n-tidy, pale skin, ""handsome"", smart, literate, elite entrepreneur young prince???? Where is the alpha-male?????!!!!!!"

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"It's a breathe of fresh air to see actors not acting like god and stuck in attack-victimise-saviour loops.  But by the 4th episode the main villain (in the game), after being really villainous, is treated like a hero and is given nearly all the screen time. The viewer doesn't want to see this guy anymore...  After this, nearly all interactions are based on the villain being the hero, and the previous main story guy is treated like a lucky whimp, even though he is decisive and moral. The whole story turns into a confused cliche to skip through."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,1,,"Watch the first episode if you can't resist the marketing hype. You'll see it's a 3/4. But since these few points - due to the fresh storyline - are undeserved (it's heavily inspired by the manga-anime Kaiji, and still succeeds in throwing away its most brillant elements by replacing them with blood and scenographies), I'll give it a 1.  Abysmal overacting, puppet characters, unrealistic and unrefined stuff. Even teens (which are the main target), once the novelty factor fades, will recognize that it's trash."

Sure, they changed just enough so as to avoid any messy legal IP/copyright issues, but let's not pretend this movie is an original idea.  I personally don't mind remakes, especially with foreign films being localized for a different audience (& culture). I just don't like it when try to pass off the remake as their original idea.  As far as the show itself goes, it wasn't bad. I rather liked it, and liked the fact it was a TV show instead of a movie -- with a TV show you get more time to explore the world & characters. Acting was OK, cinematography was excellent and the writing wasn't bad either. I'd definitely recommend this movie to friends."

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,It's irritating that people seem to be taking pride in trying to put this series down. People seem determined to miss the entire point of the series saying it started well and got too emotional/ didn't make sense blah blah blah. How boring people can be - wanting to stand out and proclaim that the series just wasn't up to their sky high standards. Get over yourselves all you Debbie Downers! This series was compelling from start to finish with great writing and brilliant acting (except maybe for the rich folks with masks in the 3rd season). I almost didn't watch the 3rd season due to all the negative publicity about how it ended. I was expecting something as bad as how Game of Throwns ended - upon watching season 3 (not just skipping through it as I am convinced some reviewers have) I found the ending satisfying and logical. I am also impressed how the entire series was the product of one writer's imagination rather than a writing team that would have resulted in a storyline watered down by committee. The cameo at the end hints at a future western style spin off series - I hope whatever iteration that follows has the same vision and focus of this brilliant series.

It still took me a couple of years, but ""Squid Game"" was nonetheless one of the first things I checked out after subscribing to Netflix.  What can I say? I didn't binge-watch the series. That doesn't mean a lot, since I only ever binge-watched 2 series in my entire life, but still... I wasn't flabbergasted or addicted straight away. The concept is very solid, with a large group of people - 456 (!) - being lured to a top-secret and completely unknown location/facility where they are forced to play kids' games for money. Lots and lots of money. Of course, there's a sardonic catch... The games' losers don't get to sit and wait until the game is finished and starts anew. Nope, you lose, you die. Either by the set-up of the game or by a gunshot from the fully disguised and masked minions who obey the mysterious ""Front Man"". The participants come from various layers of society, but all have one thing in common. They urgently need money, either because they have severe debts or because they are greedy criminal.  Throughout the nine episodes of Season 1, there's quite a lot of time & effort put in character development. It's admirable and it certainly helps to make ""Squid Game"" an absorbing and very tense TV-experience. Every participant has his or her reasons to persevere the emotionally devastating and downright lethal ordeal, and their stories are what makes ""Squid Games"" worth seeing. Well, that ... and the relentless violence; - obviously. Several of the games (notably ""Red Light - Green Light"", ""Tug of War"", and ""Glass Bridge"") are indescribably sick, cruel, and merciless. The very best episode of season one (#6) doesn't feature a bloody game, though, but painfully confronts the remaining players with a harrowing mental challenge. They are forced to form pairs, and naturally choose for trusted friends or allies, assuming they'll be battling the other pairs, but then... Ouch! This episode is an emotional roller coaster and righteously the highest rated of the first season, with (currently) 9.2/10. The last two episodes, I personally found rather disappointing - borderline dull, even - and I couldn't really accept a few of the ""twists"". That's why I'm not in a hurry to start season two, but I will eventually, and I should emphasize it remains a unique and exhilarating show from the supreme nation that is South Korea."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"The show is surprisingly good, but you need to watch it in Korean. The end is really bad, is a perfect show to discover Korean films/shows but the end is trash."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,Awesome and I like you. Best Series I have been right now.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,I started watching this show with some doubts. But after just 30 minutes I was invested in the storyline and could not stop watching. I could certainly it's the best show I have watched in a while. Great original storyline and talented actors!
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"The show is great, well worth a watch. Fantastic concept, brilliantly executed with some stellar acting and directing.  But the English dub is.. laughably bad. The show drops from an 8/10 to a generous 5/10 when you watch it on the dub.  Ignoring the atrocious acting from the English side of Squid Game, as soon as you switch it back to Korean, it instantly turn back into a beautiful piece of television, appealing to anyone aged 14 or over.  An expert on cinema, or a bored Netflix subscriber with nothing else to do; both will enjoy it equally as this is one of the best shows Netflix has released. I would definitely recommend watching. It has some thrilling twists, fabulous performances from the Korean actors, and overall a great story. If you haven't yet - watch Squid Game. And watch it the way it was intended..."

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"Squid Game (2021) Created by Hwang Dong-hyuk  ""The truth is always more heroic than the hype."" Jessica Lynch   Pandora boxes come in a multitude of shapes and sizes. Amongst them, Hype trains are one of the colossal, if not the most colossal forms prevailing around right now. There are hardly any aspects that can escape the tout blanket devised by the internet community. But, take nothing away, 'Squid Game' definitely stands out to be one of the most intricately enticing shows ever set in motion.  Converging a stiffly contrasting set of genres into one, 'Squid Game' furnished a fantastic surge-filled intrigue to the global audience throughout its limited run spanning just 9 episodes. One of the most striking ingredients is that the makers managed to deliver a sucker punch, should I call it rather a KO blow for the kinda impact it had. Many biggies failed in doing so in the past despite having a sizeable script and having moderate longevity.  Putting forth the spotlight on the suffering and deprived class of South Korea, the show trudges on forward with copious amounts of twists and turns by pushing the 456 participants to the absolute limits of humanity and make them question the moral code more often than not. With absurdity and surrealism in substantial portions, it gave the writing a license to thrill. 'Terrific' would be an understatement as long as 'making the audience bite their nails on the edge-of-their-seats' feeling is concerned.  There is scarcely any room untaken to point fingers at the acting in 'Squid Game' as every single actor on the screen has beautifully engineered and pulled off spellbinding performances; no doubt about that. In a world where the Korean culture is ravaging up the Earth through the music industry, 'Squid Game' has just become the cherry on top of the exponentially growing Korean domination.  The reason I believe why 'Squid Game' rose to fame in such a quick period is its atypical unconventionality in making. For the generation that's been built on fantasy, action, adventure, 'Squid Game' came in as a captivating breath of fresh air."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"The plot is very predictable and the protagonist is the reason for the downfall of humanity. The idea itself is quite exhausted and all of us can easily name at least five shows/movies with the same plotline and message. I am rating the series as high because of the visuals and the specifics of the games, which are (at least to me), intense and worth watching and because, currently, there is a lot of trash on TV."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,All the tv makers should benchmark their creativity with this. We are hungry for new out of the box script with good acting.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"Took me ages I know. I restarted it Halfway through after watching gganbu having realised i was massively underrating the show. Anyway just finished it.  Squid game at its best is an excellent show. Consistently engaging, highly entertaining with some seriously phenomenal characters and writing. Unfortunately it is let down by a poor ending which is real shame but as a result of just how good the rest is id definitely say it is the best release I've seen this year (unpopular take)  Here's a breakdown of my thoughts on each episode  Red Light Green Light - Really awesome opener. Sets the show up excellently  Hell - Great insight to the characters, slower but I like the pace  The Man with the Umbrella - so good, does so much right. I love it  Stick to the team - Also awesome, great cliffhanger  A Fair World - Builds on the arching drama really well. Definitely didn't cry when old man wet himself  Gganbu - Perfect. Genius piece of Tv writing. So emotional, aggravating and uncomfortable to watch. The show at its best  VIPs - So good, probably my second favourite. Looks gorgeous as well  Front Man - Great penultimate episode. It's length works well here. Sad  One Lucky Day - Bad.  Overall 8/10  It has easy 10/10 moments but the finale just isn't good."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,1,,"Squid Game Season 3 lacks the logical coherence that made the original compelling. Character motivations feel forced, with players making irrational decisions even when survival is at stake. The new games lack the clever psychological depth of earlier seasons, often relying on shock value rather than strategy. Additionally, the return of certain characters stretches believability and undermines the emotional impact of their prior exits. Twists are predictable and often contradict earlier plot points. The creators seem more focused on fan service than logical progression, resulting in a messy, disappointing continuation of the series."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Squid Game is a south-korean series that contains 9 episodes is one series.  The creator of the program is Hwang Dong-Hyeok, the genre of the serie is drama , horror. Thriller .  The story is about people in financial difficulty being invited to a mysterious survival competition.  Participating.in a series of children's games but with deadly twists, they risk their lives for a large sum of money.  I liked this series because it is intriguing, we want to continue the episodes to know what will happen."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"Since you're here it's not really possible to tell you to go into the series not knowing anything about it, like I did. I read something about the VIPS being poor actors so I was constantly looking for them VIPS who eventually play a minor role at the end of the series.  I see some people giving the series such a low score because of it, but in my opinion you're doing the series no good by that.  I had such an amazing time with the series and tried not to finish it too fast. Eventually I finished it in 3 runs but I could finish it in one run it's that fun.  The series never follow the American standardized way of a build up and the way choices are made. There were many moments where I expected something to happen where the opposite happend.  The series is fast and original with great actors. Yes there is a lot of gore and violence, but fast enough you'll see it's not (solely) about that. Especially the episode Gganbu is some of the best I've ever seen in a series.  If you're doubting about seeing it; give it a try, it is amazing!"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"Beautifully directed, the cinematography is stunning. No spoilers here, but the drama and character development is sensitivity done, and there are some great reveals. You'll love it."

This is vey disturbing, I watched 1st 3/4 episodes then the last one directly to see what happened at the end. This jst waste of time showing cruelty.  People are already having so many problems in real life, they watch shows for entertainment, to forget their stress and problem for sometime, but this show will make someone more depressed."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,Takes the physiological killer game show idea from anime and manga and adapts into live action. After you get past the premise you actually find well written characters and doomed relationships which is very refreshing for an Anime plot. You find yourself liking people and cursing their inevitable death. I loved the extra side plot refreshing from some of the boring games they played. Don't watch this for the premise watch it for the relationships.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,1,,"Squid Game Season 3 is, without a doubt, one of the most disappointing television experiences I've had in years. The first season was outstanding-fresh, intense, meaningful, and deeply human. Every moment felt earned. Every character had depth and purpose. Then came Season 2, which already felt misguided and unnecessary. But Season 3 somehow manages to sink even lower, stripping away everything that once made this series compelling.  There is no logic to anything in this season. Characters act without motivation. Decisions are made without reason. There's no growth, no structure, no emotional through-line. I didn't connect with a single character-not because they're flawed or tragic, but because they're hollow. They exist only to keep the plot moving, even though the plot itself is a mess. It feels like scenes were written and shot independently, then edited together with no regard for coherence or meaning.  It's honestly tragic that this was made and released. It doesn't feel like a television series-it feels like a product. A checklist of tropes and visual cues dressed up to resemble something thoughtful, but offering nothing underneath. The show pretends to say something about society, about power, about human nature, but it's just repeating the same lines from Season 1 with none of the tension or originality. It's empty.  The games aren't thrilling anymore. They're vague, uninspired, and edited into oblivion. The suspense is gone. The stakes don't feel real. The pacing drags, the twists are predictable, and the emotional beats fall completely flat. It's exhausting to watch something that was once so precise turn into something so careless.  And the most frustrating part? They aren't even hiding it. This feels like a manufactured attempt to cash in on brand recognition, not to tell a story. There's no passion in it-just the motion of content creation for its own sake. It's a symptom of everything wrong with modern streaming: quantity over quality, algorithms over artistry.  If there's one good thing that came out of this season, it's clarity. I now know to steer clear of anything else made by this team. And I'll be twice as careful before trusting anything Netflix promotes as a ""must-see."" This season isn't just a bad follow-up-it's a full-on collapse of what once made this show matter.  Zero out of ten. A complete misfire."

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,Just binge the whole 9 episodes And I will probably say it is one of the best series you will look after The VIPs give some boring scenes to the show But the show is still 100%worth If you have already watched Parasite and loved it this series is for you I will not recommend you this series in only one condition if you don't have a powerful heart.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,,,"The series is a collection of second-hand ideas, characters and plots collected from all over the place - starting from a Japanese movie 'Shinkansen daibakuha' about desperate workers finishing with a Russian movie 'New Land' about letting prisoners manage themselves. Not to mention dozens of survive-for-money US movies such as recent 'Escape Room'.  The only reason this series seems to appeal to Netflix auditorium is because it's Korean, so entourage and decorations look fresh and new."

Guns, death, gore and sexual content all rolled in this series.  I've watched many K-Dramas in my life and I have to say that this is one of the best. Great story telling, great acting, awesome plot.  Im glad K-Drama is getting the international recognition is deserves. Main stream America.  Kudos Netflix for having more K-Drama content."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,This is the best thriller which I have seen till now.  Vera level entertainment  Starting to end full entertainment and suspense.  Netflix proves its best.  Waiting for next season.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"I would highly recommend to someone looking for something to watch, if they take it in the spirit intended.  Squid Game was a show that I unavoidably watched late. The hype and everyone talking about it (either loving or hating it) meant I just had to give it a go. I had a feeling I would be disappointed and left with a forgettable drama which draws its viewers from its bizarreness.  I couldn't have been more wrong. I found the story to be, besides a few stretches, reasonably grounded in reality. The focus for me was the characters, which were well written and well acted. The story gripped me and I thought the games themselves were tense and kept me hooked. I thought it remained consistent throughout and finished off with a strong ending that does justice to the series. Overall, I was really impressed with all aspects of it, and is something I'd more than happily watch again and I'm glad I watched it.  One last point i'll put is I watched it with subtitles, if you can read I don't understand why anyone would pick otherwise. It adds to the authenticity and viewing experience.  In conclusion, good story, good acting and good show all around;  9/10."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,,,"Didn't expect to get emotionally wrecked by this show, but here we are. Squid Game completely sucked me in. It was super intense, weirdly beautiful, and way deeper than I thought it'd be. It makes sense that it had such an impact across the world, like it had. I immediately texted all my friends that i finished it and all they could say was ""about time. Its amazing"" The characters stick with you, the pacing is wild, and yeah, it makes you question everything about late-stage capitalism. Peak binge material. I gotta watch season two now. Hopefully its as good as the first. If not, well then atleast I've got season 1."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"The show is fun to watch and serves its purpose, entertain you.  As for the plot there are several wholes and mistakes, and even things that do not get anywhere. But it's interesting and the character development is good.  Now the worst part, the VIPs. Worst actors ever. Poorly executed and maybe poorly written? I can't imagine directing and seeing that performance and allowing it to make the cut."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"This really is first rate television. Congratulations to Netflix for championing it and getting it around the world.  Fantastic premise for a story, superb acting by a highly talented Korean cast (of whom I hope to see plenty more), stunning production and sets, and superb writing.  The ending was a little predictable, but that is easily forgiven. One request Netflix - please DO NOT use the opportunity you set up at the end. Leave it as it is and don't spoil it.  Great stuff."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"The series was along great, really great acting and the plots were great in the show ,in my opinion the end WAS good but it could've been better . All the characters were played really greatly, the most possible ending was there present in the show but just my personal opinion it could have been a bit better to seal off the show. The last episode was what just forced to finish the series in my opinion , other wise overall the games and all in the third season were great. Had a great time watching this series but I think this was and should've been the end here , because dragging it too long would dull the series the value."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,1,,"First season was in some way realistic and possible 1/100m cases but still it was interesting to watch and i was exited about second one.  Second season however was a classic Netflix-ization of a good idea.  Long 'emotionall' conversations, unncesessary characters, urealistic superheroic acts.. All in a matter of a prolonging to the season 12 probably.  Watching season 2 i felt like i watch cartoon for kids.  So many unnecessary explanations like 7yo is watching.  I skipped through most of the show.  You should play it so you can get my words confirmed but be prapared with your remote controller to fastforward.  Ashame."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"I found this show to be very entertaining. It was fun, the suspense was terrific, and rather then cliffhangers after an episode, they had the, throughout the episode. A solid watch imo. Many little things were also no predictable which was good. One thing I knew was the ending. I wouldn't had known if it wasn't for ep 7 when the host said they couldn't host. If you focus on a small detail you'd know too I think. Overall very good showing."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,A refreshing mixture of many genres to form a brand new standard!  No spoilers here because this is one to watch and explore for yourself!  I'd just say this much that I watched this by chance and been watching for 6 hours straight!  Definitely one to watch!
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"A very disturbing series to watch, however, once you start it you cannot put it of your mind until you finish all 9 episodes. The idea is new and crazy and fun to watch. But it feels unreal. You don't want this to EVER happen to ANYOME at ANYTIME!  A shoutout to the soundtracks!"

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"This is the first South Korean series I've ever seen. I really think it's a good one. The concept--similar to that of Hunger Games or Battle Royale, but they play children's games instead--is nothing new. But I really love how it's done.  It's not really that scary. But it can be a bit disturbing. That mirror game is the only scary one. Episode 2 is the only one I didn't like much. I also wish the VIPs didn't talk. The acting is great, the characters are believable, making the viewers care for what's going to happen to them.  Finale was quite anticlimactic, although I love that twist. It surprised be, to be honest."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"The VIP's were, as many said before, horrible actors."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"In an era of binge watching & streaming any thing which manages to create a hype will find viewers. Now are you willing to take a moment to think before committing 9 hours for squid game or you just cant resist the trend and dont care about time anyway; is the question.  For the thinkers out there! You dont even need to see the trailer to guess you are in for some thing like ""Hunger games"". The plot once again takes a jibe at capitalism and unequal distribution of wealth which is still fresh in our minds thanks to oscar loaded ""Parasite"". The plot is marred with implausables!!! Notwithstanding the debt crises, would someone be desperate and suicidal enough to put his life in the line with just 1 in 456 chance of winning??  Squid Games does a good job in exploiting nostalgia of childhood games, thrill of puting life at stake and natural curosity of guessing the winner. The plot is unidirectional and an odd effort done to mitigate that is not more than a distraction and fails miserably in the end anyway. The storyline and some remarkable acting performances are at their peak around episode 6 and its all downhill afterwards. Even after the winner becomes obvious the climax brings some thought provoking takeaways on how money fails to provide pleasure and satisfaction to the filthy rich and the things they can resort to just for the forgotten taste of happiness.  The violance is too much and seems like a deliberate effort to make life seem so indispensible. On the face of it we all are adult enough to know its all part of the entertainment bizz..but what havoc it may play with our subconscious, i am no expert to predict..."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,This is not a must see.. definitely.. there was so much noise about this series but finally that was pure good marketing... there are way better ways around to kill your time......
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,1,,"Could not relate to the story or any of the characters. Just didn't even care who lives, who dies. Loopholes in the story galore. Unnecessarily story lengthened which could have been much tighter. In the end was like *yawn* whatever. No issues with gore in movies, seen plenty in others but the story/acting/screenplay should hold and carry the movie through. This felt like it is riding on the wave movies like Parasite created for Korean cinema/TV. Bloated overhyped nonsense at best. Give it a skip and save your time."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"Even though the first 2 episodes weren't that amazing I loved it and would watch it again, but do not let your kids watch it. It is a lot of gore and very realistic so if you can't handle it I don't recommend it but if you can watch it."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning  SEASON ONE  Seong (Lee Jung-Jae) is down on his luck, addicted to gambling and in debt to vicious loan sharks, not to mention eager to reacquaint with his estranged son. At his lowest ebb, he finds himself approached by a man at a train station, who offers to take care of his financial woes if he agrees to participate in a secretive ritual. With no choice but to accept, Seong finds himself plunged, with a group of others, in to a nightmarish, garish battle for survival.  Korean cinema has enjoyed some recent worldwide acclaim, with cult hits such as Parasite and The Platform leaving quite an impression. But this year it's enjoyed this again in a TV format, with this mind-bending visceral blow from writer/director Hwang Dong-hyuk. It's sheer outrageousness and visual astonishment is enough to leave an impression, and even sparked some copycat behaviour around the world, with reports of people reenacting some of the 'games' portrayed.  It comes together like a fusion, of the wildest excesses of the most fantastical Phillip K Dick novel, and the most blood thirsty Quentin Tarantino film, with a fairly standard format of a group of strangers being thrown together to fight for survival, which has been portrayed in films such as Cube. Like the aforementioned films, there seems to be some societal commentary thrown in, such as increasing poverty and the gap between rich and poor, as well as the depths 'reality TV' could sink to in the name of 'entertainment.'  It's definitely been the runaway hit of 2021, that's left quite an impression, and gained quite a cult status, that, in spite of its excessive gruesomeness, can safely be said to be earned. ****"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"Squid game is truly an amazing show. It incorporates children games with death and elimination. It seems crazy, but the idea is so unique and has never been done before. I have heard many people say that squid game is not a top 10 show due to the sheer gore and craziness of the plot, however this show is great and deserves to be at the top of the list.  Squid game is a great show for the characters, setting, and for the theme. There is an amazing thing about being able to win a crazy about of money, just by competing in silly children's games. Although the back stab from others and lack of detail players get from characters, really makes it so that no one can trust anyone. We learn that people are not always as they seem and it's hard to move on from things we love. Although we also see that money will make people crazy, and they will do anything for money and wealth.  VIPs may be bad acting, although it also is to see how good the acting was in the Korean form. It was bad acting although it didn't depreciate from the score I give it.  Lastly, squid game is heart touching and the music is awesome. THE SEASON 2 ENDING IS BAD, but I sincerely hope that season 3 will make up for the harsh cut off in the season."

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"Pretty well done, This series is heavily inspired by the anime Kaiji.  If you like this series, you should give it a try the anime version, which is kinda old but good!  Story is great, actors are average but story covers for them!"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"I saw this while scrolling on Netflix and noticed it was trending on Twitter & such so I checked it out not fully knowing what to expect. This show is crazy....in a good way! Although some of the concepts and choices here have somewhat been done before it doesn't matter because I've never had an experience before, like I did with this show. Anytime a show/ movie can offer that experience it deserves recognition. Still not sure how to feel about the ending but this is definitely an awesome series. Also I would recommend watching this with the Korean dialogue and English subtitles, it feels more natural and you can hear the real actors performance this way."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,1,,"I had high hopes for Squid Game 2 after the brilliance of the first season, but unfortunately, this season was a complete disaster. There's absolutely nothing creative about it-it feels like a lazy, uninspired replica of the original, with a much worse story.  If Koreans find some of the shots and conversations funny, I honestly feel the exact opposite. The humor, if you can even call it that, fell completely flat for me. Every single thing that happened this season was predictable. There wasn't a single moment that surprised me or kept me on the edge of my seat. It's like they didn't even try to innovate or build on the success of the first season.  After reaching such a high level with Season 1, why would you go back so far? It's baffling. By the 5th episode, I was so bored that I actually fell asleep. That's how bad it was.  If this is the direction the series is heading, I honestly think it's better not to even bother with a third season. Squid Game 2 was a massive disappointment, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Season 1 is perfect, but season 2 and 3 doesn't have to really needed because in S1 the story begins all the backstory of character is introduced and all the summary of the series is introduced in 1st season how the game work and how people win  Spoiler alert:-  In the end of the series villain ask hero ""do you believe in good people"" and he point out the beggar in the street and asked the main character If the good people still exist someone will help him , and in the end the police came that showed main character was right and the villain died but main question is ""does villian saw this""  The perfect ending In post credit scene main character saw the game is still running  In season 3 post credit scene is same So in season 3 only ending is perfect."

Still, the American actors were so weird and felt like if the staff and director asked strangers in Korea if they could speak fluent English so they could act in the movie because it was really weird acting and the 69 jokes were really stupid, killed the vibe. Also, the unnecessary sex scene as in any other Netflix production felt really necessary to the plot.  I guess that's Netflix or American culture to add sex scenes in any type of film & movie?"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"I lived it S. Korea for half a decade and regularly watch kdrama so i encountered this show before it became a sensational hit. And I do recognized most of the actors in their many different shows.  How is that relevant?  I say that to highlight that I am not ban wagon rider but a regular k-drama viewer,. With that said, I do welcome all the new K-drama viewers and hope that it's not just a one off.  The show itself highlight a very important social issue that hits so close to home. The games in the show itself appear very simple yet are intense and maybe plausible if anyone were to be in the same situation.  The conclusion however left a little more to be desired. The main characters decision's seems questionable."

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,Concept is like a revival of battle royale (loosely) and very brutal. I was watching with an open jaw on episode 1. Slightly deteriorated a tad with each episode.  I couldn't invest in any character enough to care. Don't make a second series and let this stand alone as a solid series itself. Like they should've done with a Handmaids Snail.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"Interesting and a smart story. Until the VIP guests comes, all looks perfect. Unfortunately the performance of non-Korean cast is far below the Korean cast. Other than that, I have really enjoyed the series."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"The Squid Game rooted us in our own truth: we, too, enjoy watching this cruel and uncomfortable act. What will be the next game? Who will survive? We also choose our favorite and hope that it will go as far as possible. But that's not all, in the drama, for once, naked female breasts appear. Not that it's really necessary, but it's long past time for South Korea to finally dare to show off anything other than hundreds of well-built male torsos. And what a rarity to see a non-Korean actor in a Korean series. Anupam Tripathi, an Indian, asserts himself with touching and benevolent naivete, denouncing Korean society for distrust of foreigners, as well as precarization and discrimination against immigrant workers. It would seem that these are insignificant trifles, but it is precisely from such radical decisions that the success of this puzzle is formed."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"Love this types of shows when they have to gamble for there survival. Its so good and you get cut up and you just cant stop watching. The only bad thing was of course the vip acting, almost as bad as my english! If you like this types of shows you should go and watch ""Alice in borderland"" on Netflix. I personally find it better and with cooler games, better story and better characters! But thats only my opinion:)"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"Visible Korean series with almost good characterization and interesting and non-repetitive story This series, which today has become famous and viral only with Netflix commercials, cyberspace, money, has made every person one of the most watched series just because of the words of the community and people and because of the culture shock It has become one of the most watched series But have you ever wondered how popular this series would have been if it weren't for the commercials? Just like the series because of under rated BB Being canceled after the first season or two, which in my opinion are under rated series like banshee or... are really 10 times better than this over rated series Thank you for taking the time to read this text."

Who knows.  It was watchable and that is the end of it imo.  Battle Royale & Hunger Games all over again.  8,1 is waaaaay too high guys."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"Squid Game is a barbaric, dramatic, and intense indictment of modern capitalism with very in-your-face demonstrations of poverty, power, and ruthless murder. The acting and the script makes the whole thing come alive and certain episodes, particularly episode 6 and 8, had me on the verge of tears. If you watch them you will understand why. The show has some flaws, mainly some unneeded sex scenes and some questionable plot points. However it hits all the right beats and became the mass hit that it has by demonstrating the ruthless sociopathy of capitalism. This is summed up best at the end with the justification for Squid Game: it was fun."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,1,,"Basically a Gore horror show like ""The Hostel"" but bubble tea store like colours and Costumes worn which gave the audience a thrilling experience of this ""weird feeling"" because our brains usually don't connect Horror with Happy colours.

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"All the characters are well written and you can relate with most of them, I really liked the role of Jun - ho as it gave us the perspective of the guards too and not just the players. The director and the actor who played the role of Ali did a great job in making you cry. Heo Sung - tae really made us hate his character. The actor who played Cho Sang - Woo also did a great job along with the hero. There are lots of surprises at the end which are like cherry on top. I recommend you all to watch it and I can't wait for season 2."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,I never write reviews but i feel compelled to for this masterpiece. I'll try to keep this as spoiler free as I can so you can experience it for yourself if you haven't already. Let me just start by saying the entire cast did an amazing job with their characters. They really deserve all the credit. The show is so unique and a breath of fresh air from all the overused stereotypical Hollywood stuff you see today. It really is a tear jerker and pulls at your heart strings in some moments. Is very thought provoking as well and leaves you guessing at every turn. I loved all the twist you see and especially the finale. Makes you question humanity and our morality. I'm sad it took me so long to get around to watching it but I'm really glad I did. I can't wait for season 2!!! Here's to hoping Netflix doesn't cancel it like they usually do.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,It's worth a watch but the VIPs were terrible in acting.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,If you are looking for a happy ending look elsewhere. The ending was meeeeeh but just give it a try. Great acting here.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"Squid Game Season 3 was an absolutely thrilling ride from start to finish, and I genuinely enjoyed every second of it. The stakes felt higher than ever, the games were more intense and creatively brutal, and the emotional weight behind each character's choices hit harder than in previous seasons. Gi-hun's journey took unexpected and powerful turns, and seeing how far he was willing to go made the story even more gripping. Visually, the show looked stunning-the set designs, the costumes, and the overall atmosphere felt even more refined and cinematic. I loved how the story explored deeper themes of sacrifice, morality, and the cost of survival without losing that twisted edge that made the original season so iconic. The callbacks to earlier moments in the series felt meaningful, and the ending-while bittersweet-gave me chills. It's rare for a show to keep the momentum going three seasons in, but Squid Game 3 not only met my expectations, it delivered something bold, emotional, and unforgettable."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"So there's no denying that this is an entertaining show but come on people - what's all this hype about?!? The storyline itself is fairly unoriginal - although different...there are other movies based on a similar story (people playing a game against each other, resulting in death, secret societies, delving into humanities primal response to self-preservation etc.) and for the most part I found it totally predictable! Again - don't get me wrong...I enjoyed it - it was easy watching and a pleasant enough weekend binge but I genuinely do not understand the hype...there are far greater shows that deserve more credit than this. So in conclusion - watch it for yourself...but don't expect it to be mind-blowing.  P.s. The dubbing is awful - please watch it in Korean with subtitles...much, much better!"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,1,,"Honestly, I did not find the point of anything. The games made no sense, killing the people made no sense, the motive behind the games made no sense and the cherry on the cake were the VIPs! 😂 Absolutely hilarious. If you want to watch a dystopian society then the first hunger hames and the first book maze runner are pretty decent comparatively. But this did not work for me. I need to watch something really nice to chance my mood."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Really great series. Different, although it reminds me a ""3%"" it is still different enough. I watched it quite fast, good actors. The only negative is the end - last part, not sure if it was as good as expected till then... it was like.. they just really want to prepare for 2.series :/ it was still surprising but not satisfying. Worth of watching !"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"Squid Game Season 2 was interesting, offering thought-provoking themes and complex characters. However, the story felt slow at times, which reduced some of the intense excitement from the first season.  The ending was particularly disappointing, as it didn't provide closure and left everything hanging in anticipation of Season 3. It was frustrating that they didn't conclude what happened to the main character. Additionally, the events on the boat with Jee Hung's crew were left unresolved, adding to the sense of incompleteness.  Overall, while the season had its moments, a more satisfying and conclusive ending would have been better."

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,Story keeps you captivating. Its little predictable but its great watch.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"To begin I need to say the show is lower mediocre.  Actors performances are patheticly boring as if they were trying to convince themselves that their acting is right. They did not convince me at all. Especialy the main characters seem like hobby actors to me.  Plot is so flawed that by the episode 5 is does not come together already and plus is so predictable that you can guess whats coming pretty much all the time if you use your brain a bit.  The whole idea and mesaage of the show (the indebted society we live in) is not groundbreaking either for it has been depicted in far better titles than this one.  My personal opinion is that netflix had to hype up some of their show already because of the poor production they have had in past 2 years and so they finaly decided to heavily market one of their shows and they did bet on this one because its different from anything else most people seen. Mainly because of the fact that it is not american neither european culture you are getting from this one.  In fact you can not relate to the characters at all until episode 5-6 for the korean culture is so different from what we europeans and americans probably too (even though americans and their culture are pretty demented so you can never really tell) can relate to.  To conclude as I already indicated above the only catchy thing about this title is how different it os from what we are used to ""consume"". Like a breath of fresh air that you realize after a minute or two is not really that fresh.  The raw depiction of brutality is what I believe attracted the people most to this show but really there is nothing more to it.  Lastly Id like to add that 4 out 9 episodes (1,2,7 and 9 - it is really a shame that final episode is one of the weakest of the season/show) were boring and really low quality.  I scored this one 6/10 and anyone that has seen more than just the most commercial bites from international cinematography can only agree."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,Very addictive and entertaining! It has a great storyline. Absolutely Loved it.!! All characters have their unique identity and acts superbly well.  Must Watch!!
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"I had the privilige to watch this show before it blew up, so I didn't expect too much. Squid Game is suspenseful and comes with a great metaphore, but at the same time doesn't offer anything new, we have seen it all before and that with better acting, better twists and better writing, so I'm a bit surprised by the rating.  At the end of the day it is enjoyable to watch, but do not expect this show to be anything more than a pastime, sorry to the fans."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,I lost it at the end of the Gganbu episode. Amazing show.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,Accept first 2 episodes rest of the series is outstanding and very engaging. Kind of must watch shows. It has nice twisy in every game and the climax is also superb.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"Straight up from its cliffhanging season 2 finale, Squid Game leaves no room for sentiments with its emotionally damning theme featuring remorseless humans that would do anything for survival, with greed playing the secondary character. Alongside smartly written script, tremendous score, cliche ending and some brilliant piece of acting, we just have to a give a standing ovation to the heroes behind this beautiful masterpiece that will forever stand the test of time.  Squid Game is a testament that a masterpiece can come in any form, with sequences of games stretching into three seasons and each season having its own beauty and strength. Greed was the secondary character in this third season as survival takes centre stage amidst flurries of emotions and a cliche finale that was headlined by Im Si Wan's tremendous performance and a powerful script."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,".It took me a while to finish this series but overall I liked it. I think most people know the premise of the story, but i think the competition and games are not the most important part of the series, but the social critique of capitalism, greed, selfishness and people's lack of empathy and solidarity and also, it has good character development and we stick to some of them.  In relation to the technical parts i think they will border the perfection and we see the passion and care with the serie.  However, the series has negative points, such as ease of scripting and predictable parts, plot twist without sense and forced and halfway through the series it took time to unravel the story, but nothing that spoils the experience.  I highly recommend this series for those who haven't seen it and that this series is a door for many people who are still kind of prejudiced with films, series, etc. From cultures other than English or American, which I understand and that I am sometimes, but it is necessary to deconstruct these ideas and see that there is more outside our comfort zone."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"I loved this, I'm a fan of shocking movies. Example original old boy, audition and ichi the killer.  Hard to find anything like them. So I was happy to see something along those lines on netflix! Very enjoyable, only part that didn't allow me to give a ten was the vips I feel there could have been more to them BUT I'm wondering is this open for more series in their regions? Games that they host? Who knows... but I'm excited for more... I hope it goes ahead!"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"Certainly an intense experience. I would add Horror to the list of genres this resides in. It probably has more in common with SAW and HOSTEL than HUNGER GAMES, nonetheless it is original in its overall aesthetic. The series could have benefitted by shortening it by a couple of episodes and leaving out certain subplots and storylines of characters that die a few minutes after we learn a great deal of their backstory through long soliloquy's . None of that overwhelms the overall impact however and I highly recommend it."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"Its good to watch but ending is absurd...it won't reach any conclusion...overall its a one time watch, there are some characters without a background story."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,5,,"I sincerely hope there won't be a 4th season because there's no point continuing milking a franchise that goes in circles. And I'm more disappointed that this is not a Korean successful series but a Netflix cash grabber and that's obvious from the final episode of the third season that they will make an American Squid Game later which is the 4th season probably.  What I loved about the first season was it was so mysterious and an unusual world of corruption and how greed can take you to where no one should ever go.  The 2nd season had great characters development that we felt sorry for the players and wish them to make.  The third season which was actually season two part two. It had no story just kill off everyone we loved in season two and make them also villains in seasons 3.  And also I didn't like the script (except for season one) it felt a kid had written plot, Gi Hun survived the game only to go back in with no back up plan and improvising stupidity.  So I give Squid Game a 5/10 I was about giving it 10/10 but after third season it goes down to five and if a 4th season coming with American squid game then I will change it to 1/10 because the Korean actors were so great that the Hollywood actors today are not even close to live up to it.  And for Netflix you're eliminated, and sorry Legend Thanos but no more games."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"Decent show, good acting and cast, definitely best K-drama I've ever seen, I would probably never rewatch it but it isn't necessarily bad, it is definitely overrated though, I liked the violence and gore, also unlike most K dramas the plot doesn't seem like it was put together in a day and the movie doesn't look like it was filmed by a teenager with an old camera that they found in their basement, also the editing/green screen is a lot better than expected, and most of the actors are hot so they made it easy to watch hahahah.. Also it isn't too long, nor is it too short, which is good because I can't watch things for a prolonged amount of time."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"The excitement, characterization, and plot twists were extremely good, but some of the extra scenes from some characters, like the detective or the lady guard, seemed like they were just to fill the series' time, and that's why I didn't give it a ten. The most positive thing I saw in this series was the evolution of the main character, so much so that in the last episode he no longer resembled the first episode of the series."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,Without crossing that line of spoiler alert there is two glaring issues with this series but not enough to make this unenjoyable.  I wish these issues where at the beginning not the end of the series but it was one hell of a watch. As I sat there it made me remember films like Old Boy... fight club and Charlie and the chocolate factory. Last 15 mins of episode 1 it really goes off. It was like of running man and battle royale had a baby.  If your not hooked by end episode one then I wouldn't bother continuing but you will for sure. I voted 9 which was a little higher than I would have but people voting 5 is well out or order also so it is my way to balance it out as this has to be the best tv series I have watched this year.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"The show started of great, but after episode 4 it went downhill really fast. In the last episodes i was allmost confused if i was watching a Korean serie or a Mexican telenovel. Don't even get me started with rhe vips. And the agent looking for his brother was a bit to obvious for me who his brother turned out to be. As well as the old man and his death. A possible great show got crinchy and predictable the last episodes."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"I watched the whole season and though it was mediocre, I know a lot of people like it but I felt like some of the chapters were shallow and pretty much as a hole thought it was boring( I mean there might be some bias as I seen movies and some shows that are very similar)"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"This series was a breath of fresh air. The cinematography , the script , the acting in this series was amazing . I highly recommend people to watch this . The characters are so well put together and memorable. The games and brutality of it make it edge of the seat action!!"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"Squid Game was very predictable, specially Player number 1...This theme is nothing new. I didn't find anything to be super hyped...."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,5,,"I liked season 1, but season 2 was a disappointment and season 3 was even worse. They want American validation so bad, the story made no sense in the end, as well as the characters. The end is very disappointing. It's a shame because the Korean actors are excellent and season one was good, but the Americans actors and their characters were so bad and ruined everything. All the scenes of frontman's brother were absolutely useless and added nothing to the story. They should have focused more on squid games. The rebellious pink soldiers had potential in season 2&3 but it just wasn't well written. I had expectations for season 2 as I really liked season 1, but I was disappointed. Not even talking about how season 3 was. A huge waste."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"Great story, great pacing and visually, it packs a punch! It is similar to Battle Royale however, it delves deeper and provides great character development and a real feast for the eyes in terms of the colourful sets and and costumes. It's raises many questions around humanity and how far you would go to help others or save yourself.  It's a wild ride from the moment it begins and the relatable characters really draw you in. There have been a lot of comments about the VIPs - just ignore those! The version of the film I watched is dubbed so maybe there's a reason for the slightly off-pace intonations; but that doesn't take away from the performances.  It's certainly binge worthy and if you can handle the odd violent scene, then go for it!"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"The show was really entertaining and kept me on my toes. However, I think that some episodes were inconsistent, and the ending was awful. Maybe it should have been a movie instead of a show."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"It doesn't appeal at first, but if you you'll stay tuned, you'll see a really good drama series with some very well written characters.  Watch it!"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,One of the best shows on netflix in recent times . Background score is just amazing.

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"Thank goodness for Netflix, Korean TV production, and the SQUID GAME. Thoughtful, captivating, engaging. Although the first 2/3 of the first episode were almost boring, the last 1/3 of the first episode hooked me for the rest of the series. Episodes 1 - 9 were all great. I sincerely wish more American TV and storytelling were like this. I also hope that nothing further is done with this. Anything more would spoil what it is."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,Amazing series definitely recommend. To watch. Perfect.
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,5,,"Does Netflix make anything good any more?  No, no it doesn't.  Squid game, season 1, was indeed a masterpiece. The Korean drama machine pulled out a fantastic script, a dystopian Black Mirroresque chiller, a bag of intense performances.  Then Netflix proceeded to make a tedious, vague, kinda-sorta action series with lots of talking, using the sets and characters from the first season.  And with a blatant commercial for a future project that, I GUARANTEE, will be unwatchable garbage.  You knew the wheels had come off when the opening credits music was no longer the 'ooh-ah' spooky child chorus from the first one.  The wheels, however, continued to fall off.  Squid Game, the thing that you KNEW had to have a message somewhere - right?? - ended up just fizzing.  And with it, fizzed Netflix's last hope.  Their documentaries are terrible - they just cover material others have covered better, with awful, awful, awful music that NEVER STOPS EVER, and every single interview shot with the head facing just out of the frame because MR ROBOT, and miles of padding with important details underemphasised and unimportant details overemphasised.  Their dramas are all just copies of European ones. Bad copies.  All their police stuff is Scandi Noir. And they are almost ALL 'somebody returns to a small town and the odour of dirty laundry floats up'.  Once in blue moon they produce something that is forecast ""Ok with a chance of highlights"" - CRIMINAL was not a bad example, it was never boring even when it wasn't completely interesting, and it had a couple of standout episodes.  SQUID GAME was one of those highlights.  Look, bittorrent exists and I'm sick of paying money for no content to these Ketamine addicts."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"Character development was strong in this one. I binged thgis one so it really absorbed my mindscape for a few days. Left with a lot of ""what would i do if i was that person?"" the best character was the old man. Im sure if they knew of the success of this mini series they would have invested more in the props and locations."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"Squid game offers everything you can ask for in a guilty pleasure gore filled thriller. They also take their time to really flush out the characters even with such a diverse cast, highlighting all aspects of humanity that would expect to see in a game of life and death.  With a 9 episode run for this 1st season it's a great weekend binge show."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"Another series were it keeps you on your toes, but then the ending has you scratching your head. Why?????"
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"The survival game trope isn't usually my thing, but this one was actually done really well. The characters are complex with backstory so it's not just all about the games.  I agree with everyone else about the VIPs. Prepare yourself for them and try to pretend they didn't happen. I can't wait for the day kdramas stop sticking random English speakers into their shows. They're always the worst actors and no matter how good the show and the Korean actors are, the English speakers always instantly make the scene cheesy and look and act like a fish out of water.  To be fair I have spoken to a Korean friend who told me that due to the language barrier this awkward delivery isn't picked up on in Korea. But just a warning, the English speaking scenes in this show were the most cringy I've seen in any kdrama, both acting wise and writing too for some reason. The rest of the show was great.  Otherwise, highly recommended. I loved the last episode, and it seems they left room for a possible season 2."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"From start to finish, it was more predictable than a 1990s slasher...yes there were vibrant colors, yes it was in a foreign language, yea there was female empowerment. All the things that make up an academy award winner, right? An overrated, overhyped spin on an old story and a told in a sub par way in a different language..."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"On the base, Squid Game appears to be a standard Korean horror/thriller we have been slowly getting more accustomed to in the west over the past few years, however beneath the surface is a very deep, complex and scarily real message that is incredibly relevent in these troubling times.  Without spoiling anything, this series is certainly worth sticking with through the slower parts, as the ending and message is extremely powerful. Worryingly, I feel the complexity of the message may mean it is lost on the average viewer, but left me deep in though and reflection upon its completion.  I'm sure in the years to come this series will be looked back on as the benchmark for complex and contrasted story telling, and even though it is extremely popular now, in years to come it's message may be more appreciated."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,1,,"Squid Game became a major disappointment. The core concept is mildly intriguing, yet excessively disturbing, offering no real value beyond shock and despair. It feels more like a reflection of societal decay than meaningful entertainment. The writing is painfully lazy, relying on characters making ridiculous, illogical choices just to move the plot forward. And like so many shows today, it's bloated - stretching a thin story over far too many episodes with minimal payoff. Season 2 could've been told in 6 or 7 episodes (rather than the 13 that exist), instead dragging on endlessly with repetition and filler and a TON of whining. Total trash that got worse as the episodes wore on. So bad, I didn't even watch the last episode + because I couldn't stand it, instead reading the summary on Wikipedia."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"One of the very few TV series which I watched in one go. Fantastic concept, great acting and superb screen play makes it one of the classic TV show of all times."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,10,,"With a very well-structured scenario, which combines in a thrilling way the emotion with the decisions, as if to translate them from real life into a tough game that wants nothing more than to highlight the decisions we each make in our daily lives. Daily and which cannot be erased like this without a sacrifice, sometimes supreme: one's own life."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"Great show with surprising end but with the fear of a second, everything destroying second season due to the open last part of the show."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"I was hesitant to watch it at first because of all the hype surrounding it. But I gave in in the end and I'm so glad I did. Binge-worthy series. Original plot and highly entertaining. I was happy to rewatch it with my partner who was late to the party. Minus 1 star for the horrible acting from the VIPs. But it's ok, they're hardly in it and so thankful for that. The rest of the actors were great! The old man/ player #1 was my favourite and his character brought so much to the story. Great character development and story in general."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"A battle royale-style concept that's been done many times in different forms (e.g., Alice in Borderland, 3%, Hunger Games, etc.), but there's just something in the way that Korean artistic style makes even the most cliched story lines interesting again. The first episode felt a little sluggish, but gets going by the end, and boy does it get going!  The show is thoroughly enjoyable and gripping to watch, but gets predictable towards the end. Not only that, I think the writers ran out of shocking novel ideas about how to stage the namesake game in the end. But by then, you may just appreciate the relief of a straight-forward conclusion.  Definitely binge-worthy! Though they could make a sequel/season 2, I don't think they should--it doesn't really need it, nor leaves you wanting more."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,9,,"Yeah, this series is pretty awesome but I don't think it needed another season. And that is the problem, you can feel them stretching out for another season. Greed killed this series for me and nothing else."

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"Season 1 rated 8. 7 if they make another.  This series expresses an aspect of Korean movie culture, which wants to show people in their worst poor helpless state  A recent Korean movie got so famous, and it showed how people live in home of others without getting detected. Similar kind of movies are something that Korean society seems to enjoy. Watch the destituteness helplessness of urban poor. It is not the VIPs that are making this game play and them enjoying it. It the well feed society of Korea that wants to enjoy others with lesser means of survival in our present capitalistic society getting ripped off the basic necessities for living. America has done it's part of making a society completely opposite of communist North. Completely filled with big shopping heaven, richness, laviousness, go to place to have plastic surgeries, so and so  Ask yourself, what society would it be where large crowd would gather in a colosseum to watch gladiators killing each others right in front. People killing each other, getting killed and there it just one survivor. How cruel it is.  Series showed that this game is played for many decades.. Seriously.. no flaws in it? Wasn't there Korean Bruce Lee or Rambo to save the day? All this years and no one detected it? Every year 455 dying on this earth and police didn't know or attempted to catch them?  Rule of the game is if anyone wants to quit the game they will be eliminated. So don't people should know that elimination means being killed? It's only after round 1 does people know about it. Rules should be in essence clear and not be coded or with a duel meaning. Rule of rules is not followed. Round 1 was with so many unnecessary killings.  One day before I read in news of best and topmost reputation from UK, that this series is getting more and more liked across nations. But there main topic in the news was that the English subtitles are not doing good justice to the excellent Korean dialogue. Again seriously.. Why would a English knower will be bothered about minor translation loss or miscommunication. We are watching it more then actually reading subtitles line by line. Many Korean who knows English well enough have to say this about subtitles. How will it affect? By getting better appreciation? Answer from me is no!  Apart from it, the best thing is the setup of the games and the rooms. It seems that set production was one excellent piece of work. Perfection in the making feel that that's where a game should be played. The colors the dresser the clean act except of course by VIPs.  I enjoyed the series but I am sorry, the meaning of Korean movie culture shows an aspect that is darker then one may think."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,2,,"The first season was very interesting. Somehow it progressed into steaming garbage. Very disappointing. This show had so much potential. Not that the plot should have been realistic, but this could not have been cheesier. I had much higher expectations after seeing what was possible. For example, Parasite. The first two seasons were watchable, but season one was by far the best. It's as if the writers were afraid to do anything novel or interesting after introducing the original shocking plot. They could have easily continued with a groundbreaking show, but decided anything but predictable would somehow be offensive. Again, very disappointing."

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"Even tho some elements fall flat, what works in this show works brilliantly. Whether the stunning visuals, gorgeous set designs and production value, interesting and likable main characters, spot on casting, the suspense of an engaging and unique story, decent plot twists, dark and mature subplots rarely covered in mainstream tv, good acting and more. I myself would also take great notice to the second episode, ""Hell"", that really makes great effort into showing realistically the sad backstories of our characters to justify why they would even put themselves in such situation.  The flaws include a couple of bad performances, the VIP's seem like a really wasted opportunity to actually have memorable villains instead we got generic and awful eye-rolling performances, some decisions are questionable, the whole plot line of the cop had an underdeveloped ending that made the subplot feel pointless and underwhelming etc.  But overall i def recommend this series as it is unique and engaging in a way that will leave you enjoying every minute of it and asking for more."

I really enjoyed the whole idea of it and the social commentary it involves. That part definitely resonated with me.  My biggest issue is that the series feeds into a bunch of problematic stereotypes and tropes that annoyed the heck out of me, so during the last couple of episodes I wasn't really invested in it anymore.  There's good stuff in there but it's definitely flawed."

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"It is not a secret for anyone that each season of Squid Games gives a different sensation in the way everything was lead until the end.  The first season was a look for a misterious story with multiple macabre games, telling us a survival story where we could see what human beings are able to do just to be alive. We had interesting plots and subplots that left us with a very good sensation at the end. On the other hand, the games and characters were really memorable and everything was coherent and solid in the writing.  The second one tried to provide more action and suspens from other perspective, giving a few moments where the spectator could wait for a huge climax in the story considering how the new characters were involved, but the result was totally wasted.  And finally, we have a third season that was not able to overcome the problems of the second season, just adding more and more of them. Some subplots were really poor (You know who I am talking about), forcing some events in an accelerated manner and others in a totally slow manner.  All in all, we have a very good beginning with an excellent development, then we had a promising second part that just worked as an excuse to lengthen something that ended well, but in its eagerness to add more, it ends up doing less, even with very interesting ideas in it. And finally, a third season that wastes everything that was good about the previous ones with a lack of development of some characters and questionable decisions in the writing.  Still, you can find a perfectly fun and entertaining story from beginning to end if that's what you're looking for."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,8,,"I use to binge watch shows a lot. Then I kind of went through a slump. This show reminds me what a good show is about. The main cast were generally very good at making me sympathize. I think I recognize the stormshadow actor from GI Joe. The rich elite VIP actors (as other have mentioned) I swear were told to be hammy. Thankfully their scene presence is short. Make no mistake, this show is somber, melancholic and not a rainbow /sunshine kind of show.  Some questions about this world is revealed and so It sounds like there could be a season 2 but I really kind of wish they don't focus on the games again."

오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,7,,"Long time viewer of both Netflix and K-dramas, and this one is a fantastic blend of the best of both. The amazing, succinct story-telling from Korean dramas plus the uncensored gore, cursing, and production quality of a Netflix original. This show is unpredictable, well written, well acted, and extremely unique. When I initially saw the premise/trailer I thought it was going to be a copy of Alice in Borderland, and while there are similarities, there are a ton of differences that made each one unique (I liked Squid Game better).  For the love of all that is holy, PLEASE watch the original Korean language version with subtitles. The dub actors did okay, but the speech and inflection nuances are left out. Plus the English dub seems to go off the subtitles rather than the actual language, (I can understand some Korean) so there are definitely some liberties taken that change the meaning/tone of certain scenes and characters.  For those who are complaining about the VIP's: yep, that is a trademark of K-dramas, using bad actors for the English/foreign characters. I recognized some from other K-dramas, and their acting is unfortunately stiff and subpar. Perhaps now that the show is so popular and may even get a second season, future foreign characters will be played by decent actors.  Either way, this show is a great, gory thriller that has a thought-provoking underlying message: what would you be willing to do for money?"

Definitely a 10/10."

Kinda like ""Hunger Games"", but without the fantasy elements and more misery. Started strong, but loses a lot of momentum near the last third of the show. While it wasn't a chore to finish the season, I wasn't too thrilled with each subsequent episode either. The revelations were either cliche or stupid. It was only the characters that saved the show for me. They were great till the end."
오징어 게임,Squid Game,2021,6,,"Unlike some other comments, this is LIKE other things I've already seen or heard of. It's a built on a bunch of different already used ideas, and put together into a smart package that pleases the directed target group (which is basically everyone), which was *told* to watch and enjoy this show. Marketing wise these creators hit the jackpot and the hype train is real.  Almost any fast going series can get really captivating and easy to binge nowadays, and the only thing original is that this one got to the extreme when it comes to exposure and word-of-mouth.  I'm not saying it's a bad series but when the hype is over and people might reflect again it will probably be viewed as the 6 to 7 rated series that it is. Those who can recite the happenings in the series a month after watching it are welcome to prove me wrong though."

Unexpectedly I opened up my Netflix account and this show's plot synopsis grabbed my attention. Next thing I know I'm getting pulled all the way through an unexpected 1-day binge session (about 9 hours).  The show is slow at times yet never boring, just taking its time between brutal fatalities (and brutal they are). The characters are troubled, each of them with their flaws (even the main character). That too felt fresh compared to the typical Hollywood protagonists who always seem to be so likable with a ton of charisma and humor.  Creative story wise but also in its graphics. I loved the looks of the location with its game rooms and the characters. Speaking of Marvel, the costume of the Frontman would make a great Dr Doom outfit.  Anyway long story short, just go watch it. You won't regret it."

Sometimes it falls so deeply into its childish play you may wonder if the show has been made for juniors.  Final thought: a very entertaining miniseries that I wished was made in Hollywood! End of story!"

This is the first Korean TV series my wife has seen and with the last episode still to play out, she is already a fan of them.  The Glory achieves exactly what you want from a TV show like this... something you look forward to watching at the end of a busy day. It's so engaging that we have been watching 2 to 3 episodes each night, with almost no distraction from our mobile/cells phone.  The story its self has several levels to it and goes deeper than what I was expecting... and where I would normally expect a twist (had it been an American series) The Glory show catches me off guard by playing out exactly as it should do.  The sole reason for removing 1 star is it does feel a little drawn out at times, but oddly, it also works as at no time did I feel bored watching it.  As a result The Glory comes Highly Recommended!"

First 30 minutes of 1st episode was really hard to watch, not because it's bad, but because it's so good potraying how brutal high school bullies can be.  And forget Song Hye Kyo as a ""South Korean Melodrama Queen"". Here she's poignant and dark due to her character's constant bullying in high school. You'll only see her smile after 20 minutes into the 2nd episode and laugh after mid 5th episode. Yeah, that's how bleak The Glory is.  And season finale, 8th episode was a cliffhanger.

Humanity warmth and thoughtfulness inadvertently and naturally reveal when DongEun and the maid meet.

The only thing I wish they'd done differently was to cast someone older for Joo Yeo-jung for a more balanced pairing with Song Hye-kyo, because let's be real; she had more solid chemistry with Jung Sung-il as Ha Do-yeong than with Lee Do-hyun.

더 글로리,The Glory,2022,7,,"So the series starts well, as well as revenge story can go. After the first episode you find yourself both excited for some deserved belated retribution and horrified at what you've just witnessed. The plan is in motion, even if it takes 18 years.  We are following Dong-Eun as she climbs step by step towards her revenge and all is well. She makes the contact with her targets, you wait with baited breath for her next move. And then - the action slows, threads get intertwined and more and more characters have something to say. It's harder to make mental notes of what our protagonist is trying to achieve and a bit wild that noone is really pulling the strings to stop her so far. Everyone has a hidden story and it's getting messy keeping the tabs on all of them. At times it seems they are walking in circles and waiting. At times it's a bit confusing too. I've found myself speeding up to get to the end only to find out that it's not the end at all. Always check if the series you're bringing is finished.  I hope the second part will be better. It seems like they are capable of very dark things and I got the impression that's where we're headed. I just found myself dissappointed at how muddy the middle part got and I really hope the script will be sharp and crisp for the next part. This series has a potential for exceptionally twisted story, otherwise it's another dull revenge plot."

I have more chemistry with a slice of pizza than the main antagonist with her dreams/motivations (her relationships with her husband and daughter).  Main character is ok. Comes off as dead inside, no anger or sadness or joy. Just dead. Not great for a revenge story, but some moments are saved by her veteran acting skills.  Main character's love interest is a 27yo, acting the role of a 35yo, but comes off as immature & shallow as an 18yo. He's a stereotypical teenage girl's crush: a doctor & a bad boy who gets into fights, empathetic & loved by his patients, from a good background & willing to kill for his love interest who doesn't reciprocate any kindness.

When they are angry they can only scream and curse. They don't give any depth to their character by acting with real emotions. That makes their appearance cringe-inducing to watch. And that's a pity, because the main idea itself was promising.  The real reason why series like this fails, is because they try so hard to create a significant difference between the good and bad people.

The tension build up and complexity of the characters makes you care what is going to happen something a lot of series forget to do these days.  The acting is superb especially by Song Hye Kyo who plays Dong Eun,she manages to play her anger frustration and sadness brilliantly.

더 글로리,The Glory,2022,8,,"""There will be no forgiveness, and so... there will be no glory either."" - Moon Dong-eun  The Glory is a South Korean television-series written and executive-produced by Kim Eun-sook, molding a harrowing tale about a disfigured victim of high-school violence that carefully plots her revenge against those who have wronged her. Song Hye-kyo delivers a commendable leading performance as the scorned woman, Moon Dong-eun, who has cashed in all her chips toward this path of no return. Ahn Gil-ho provides masterful direction for the series. Allowing the viewer to take a backseat to this grand scheme orchestrated by Dong-eun, narrating every step of her growth to the leader of the oppressive group, Park Yeon-jin (Lim Ji-yeon) whom I must admit was the perfect choice to portray an apathetic villainess. The casting for this series is impeccable as the performers handle their roles seamlessly. The storyline provides a valuable lesson to the audience on how we reap what we sow. Be weary of your actions and whom they may affect because everything in life has a price. The series contains valuable social commentary on the upper class abusing their power and how they are able to evade heinous crimes such as human humiliation and abuse, tying into the severity of school bullying within South Korea. Showcasing very gruesome and grotesque scenes which are not for the faint of heart.  The series' weakness lies within its predictability as the viewer can already tell how this storyline is going to end. The theme feels familiar to other popular revenge stories such as 'Lady Vengeance' and the 'Kill Bill' duo-logy. But I believe the narrative is truly about the journey rather than the destination and this certainly has been a memorable experience as I unapologetically binge-watched the season in two days. I am looking forward to the release of Part 2 with the conclusion of this potently written drama.  IG: thecinephilereviews."
더 글로리,The Glory,2022,7,,"There are a lot of great scenes and execution in this show. I loved that the show, for the most part, departed from the typical overly dramatic cheesy romance like many other dramas.  That's where the show shines the most, when it's focused on the crime and suspense. The show starts off really well and pace really well past the midpoint where it becomes really sloppy.  While I completely understand the motive of the lead woman, she's extremely boring, stone-faced, one-dimensional, and not very enjoyable to watch. Surprisingly all of the best moments are moments showing other characters. The dullest moments are those with her and her depressing obsessed doctor follower.  Seriously? Even as cringy, annoying, whiny, and obsessed so many people are in most Korean dramas are, Joo Yeo-Jung takes the cake. His obsession and 'love' for Moon feels soo unnatural, out of place, and unwarranted it really waters down the rest of the show.  I'd score the show two points higher if they removed him (or the weird awkward chemistry) from the main plot. He's like a real manifestation of plot armor for the main character in the form of a 'lover.'"
더 글로리,The Glory,2022,10,,"One should not watch this as a K-drama point of view, because this simply pass all K-drama standards and could be regarded as a high quality television series.  If I go on to describe the characters, it may give out spoilers, so I am just going to say that every single cast member brought their A-game when giving life to these characters. Of course, the great actress Song Hyekyo stands tall amongst all of them for her micro expressive, cold and calculating character. But, even the little kid was really doing a great job and we felt raw emotions from all of them.  Lee Dohyun got a bit sidetracked in the first few episodes, despite him being the male lead, but he is very prominent and integral during the second half. He was the heart and soul of the show where the energy is provided by Hyekyo. Their chemistry was very palpable as well. Overall doing a spectacular job as the cast.  The director and writer must get along very well as the drama flowed very smoothly in a good pacing, without any fillers nor unnecessary characters. Even the camera angles and editing brought the highest of emotions to us. The dialogues were not over the top nor cringey and felt authentic.  The drama ended in a highly satisfactory note as well with no lose ends and everything getting tied up really nicely and neatly that you as a watcher feel content after watching the drama.  Highly recommended."

The facial expressions on the main bully chick were farcical and her two girlfriends were caricatures at best. I lost count of the amount of times they called each other ""b*#*@"". So much slapping, hair-pulling and destruction of property.  Most of the cast were overacting like crazy and the main character had one expression. The best out of a very poor lot was the helper lady who was being beaten by her husband. It all got a bit wearing after a while.

This show has nothing but clichés and an unrealistic script to offer. It's slow and filled with useless scenes and dialogs. Really, it's your typical K-Drama, shallow but shiny.  It does shine indeed but only in vanity. None of the characters have redeeming qualities. They're either murderers, would-be killers or violent criminals. All that, very casually!  Quite surprisingly, the episodes are long but nothing meaningful ever really happens and the plot never seems to progress. So, my advice: do not waste your time!"

Season 2 just came out yesterday and it's already at No. 3 on Netflix.  I heard some people complain that Son Hye-kyo's character was a little too old but hearing it from Son Hye-kyo herself, that was all intentional. Her character Dong-eun went through so much in her life that she would look visibly older than her old classmates. Having a hard life would age anyone faster, make sense.

The Glory"" Season 1 delivers a gripping and emotionally charged narrative centered around vengeance and redemption. The show follows the intense journey of a protagonist who meticulously plans to destroy the lives of those who tormented her in the past.  The series excels in portraying the deep psychological impact of bullying and the lengths to which someone might go to seek justice. The main character's methodical approach to exacting revenge is both chilling and compelling, showcasing a well-crafted plot that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats.  The performances are standout, with the lead delivering a nuanced portrayal of someone driven by pain and rage. The supporting cast also adds depth to the narrative, creating a rich tapestry of characters that enhances the story's emotional resonance.  The writing is sharp, with tight pacing and a focus on intricate details that make the protagonist's plans both believable and riveting.

The story is very engaging with great pacing and a lead that is instantly easy to get behind. Yeon Jin as an antagonist is equally, SO HATEABLE! I enjoyed my time with this very much, it was consistently good with a few standout episodes. Bullying and school violence is a subject that needs to be explored more within media. Also the lighting in this show is insane, casually better looking than any MCU modern project. K dramas take their time and don't hold back on the story they want to tell. Would have liked to see Moon delve into the consequences of her seeking revenge more but the show handles the grey morality of these characters very well and it is a very satisfying experience."
더 글로리,The Glory,2022,9,,"The Glory is a thrilling revenge drama that unfolds slowly. It's dark, sometimes brutal, and nicely shot. Often enough, you're not sure what's part of the plan and what isn't, which makes it even more engaging. For me, it's one of the few K-Dramas that didn't feel dragged over the length of 16 episodes, and normally I don't enjoy this kind of plot. Yes, the main lead seems cold, but here and there you catch a glimpse into her well buried feelings, and over time, she opens up to the few people she trusts.  Of course, the plot is not realistic. The main lead gets lucky more than once, but still, a well-planned revenge on evil people is just satisfying to observe, especially when it's written in an intelligent, unpredictable way."

Words just moves the plot, add sizzles to the emotions but no depth other than one offs. That's almost always the problem with this type of show. Revenge is revenge. It serves the underdog but not realistically. It's almost a fantasy.  Sixteen episode is a bit long, plus extraneous characters and prolong who done it.

I think it is rare that a story actually delivers the justice that we as viewers want to see but here it is done so perfectly. Even when there is a set-back in the plan, it isn't a very big one, normally this type of story would involve too much of a one step forward and ten steps back trope, but in this case the right person is finally winning and it is so good!!

더 글로리,The Glory,2022,7,,"Maybe because I had such high expectations?  Revenge stories are not my fav, admitedly. But I still sort of liked ""Again My Life"" and ""Itaewon Class"" is my second favourite drama of all times.  So... Let's begin with what I liked.  The lady who was beaten by her husband. She may be the reason why I managed to watch to the end. Her acting was decent while her character was rather realistic. She was also fun and warm.  Ye-Sol's father. The actor was handsome and his character was classy to the very end. The bits of romance he brought were the only ones that made my heart flutter.  I also liked the tiny twist in the end, the reason the villainess will get a little more than what she was sentenced with. Not enough though.  What I didn't like.  The music. Dull. Discrepant. Useless. When it should have been there to enhance emotions, it only blurred them.  The acting. OMG. Is this a joke? The villains were caricatures. I mean, evil laughs, crazy laughs, lustful looks, nasty glances, yelling, swearing and throwing things across the room. That's it. I couldn't even hate or resent them. They didn't feel like real people.  SHK was beautiful of course, as ever. But so lifeless. She looked like a zombie. Not even a brain-craving zombie. Just a corpse walking about. No purpose. No energy, no presence, let alone charisma. With everything her charater went through, I couldn't feel for her. I never even shed a tear or felt my heart tighten for her. I didn't care. Her revenge itself was a mess, a combination of artificial luck and coincidences. Basically, she threw meat at a pack of wolves and waited for them to rip each other's throats. Good idea, but her character was too weak to stand out in the fight, even as a triumphant spectator.  I remember Park Seo-Jun in Itaewon Class. The burning rage, the relentless hatred, the drive. He looked like a super nova.  On the contrary, SHK looked like a cold rock... I realize hers is a character who is supposed to be broken, dead even if still walking, an empty vessel whose soul was simply erased. I think this is what the director was looking achieve and he succeeded, but as a result, I couldn't relate to the victim. I felt no sympathy for her. A mere rock. Not even a blade.  Come to think about it, I wouldn' say SHK is a great actress. I love her looks but I noticed more than once how rigid her acting could be. In ""Encounter"" she was already this cold and lifeless. Again, I blamed it on the character. I'm not so sure now. She was exactly the same in ""That Winter The WInd Blows"". Maybe better in ""The Full House?""  At any rate. This show was so and so. No real flaws. Worth watching (not sure why), but nothing special.  Ah. If there is a third season. I won't watch. Not that there is anything to ruin. Just... Not interested."

Note to Netflix: viewers like characters who still have some humanity left in them. Who can feel, laugh empathize smile and show emotions. Although the main character was bullied and I can understand why she would become hard later in life, by gosh she was so stiff and straight it became annoying. I haven't even finished yet and not sure if I will but please if writers can correct this, it will keep viewers coming back.

더 글로리,The Glory,2022,7,,"Never been the first review before! I watched the first season throughout one day, a bit sped up because it tends to drag out. I recently watched My Name, so I was definitely getting flashbacks a lot, it's like a cleaner, Sky Castle-ish version (in terms of overall atmosphere, how slow it is, how everyone is unexplainably a rich jerk, but they're all good actors). My Name was definitely superior.  I won't say I enjoy the female lead's constant lack of expression, but I was intrigued by the story and wanted to see what happens. I don't normally watch series unless all seasons are out but somehow I felt I won't mind this time, we've all seen it before, similar themes/plots, etc.  If this was my first Kdrama I'd be horrified by the bullying. I feel I've become desensitized to it after a couple of years. This can't be a good thing. So I don't get why Kdramas have to rely so heavily on this concept. Especially when it's overly dramatic/over the top but not at all justified/explained.  However, I can't help but always think how a nation that takes politeness so seriously, it's even built in their language, plus all the constant bowing etc, can be so unexplainably and viciously rude and mean. Or does one explain the other? Personally I advocate for language reform lol but I don't see it happening any time soon. However I don't see any other solution for these kids to not go through trauma like that. And then also have their trauma dramaticized, that's a weird cycle to keep perpetuating, even if the element of revenge seems cathartic. I'm not sure it actually is.  But I can't say for sure until after Season 2 which will be released a couple of months from now."
더 글로리,The Glory,2022,7,,"I am a parent and a teacher.  The behavior from the first episode is not ""bullying"" but assault. Let's call these attacks what they are. Assault is a crime no matter the age or the perpetrators' roles whether directly attacking, or making the attacks possible. Rather than the numerous drama series showing the criminals attacking other students always with impunity, expose physical and verbal assault in the school system for what it is: a crime punishable by expulsion and imprisonment.  For the victim to become obsessed and as vicious as the criminals-while understandable-makes her no better. I am still waiting for a brilliant writer like this one to stop the histrionics and go after the criminals and their supporters carefully and methodically and legally until they are expelled and imprisoned. Because it never should have gone as far as it was allowed. And it won't stop until it is exposed and punished in the courts. That said, everyone in this drama is excellent. Think how much more they could have been in a true revenge story resolved through the courts."

After studying and making some money , she returns only for revenge! (I cannot understand why she is doing something like that rather than living her life peacefully? )  The awful script continues with main actress's plan. To my mind, the plan has no reason of existence ,as she could just publish from the very beggining all the story about the school years' bullying.  Moreover, the bad guys have not any depth in their characters. They were just stupid , extremely violent and ultra sexual human beings. We never learn anything about their psychology and the way they are led to be such craps.  Last but not least , the love story. ONE OF THE WORST love story in kdrama's history. No chemistry between the cold-face actress and the young surgery boy. Every scene and dialogue between them is just too....cringy.  I still can't understand why so much hype around this drama. In my opinion , this drama doesn't worth to watch it. There is no even a moral message. In the end bad and good guys are the same. Both are cruel and with no sense of humanity and that's sad.  In a world full of cruelty ,it's just disappointing to see that there is nothing teach us how to be good."

Lim Ji-yeon, Cha Joo-Young were so perfect in capturing the very duality of two-faced characters. At times I couldn't even hate Lim Ji-Yeon's character because of the depth she went to to capture the evilness of the character. Yeon Hye-ran was probably my favorite as Mrs. Kang as she manages to put some humor into an otherwise very painful story arc. When she was eating in the car and laughing at a news forum, that was such a pure moment for that character.  The pacing is fantastic. Never once did it let up on its suspense and mystery. It kept hold of it's suspense through a well executed plot that uses each scene to present a piece of the puzzle and wastes no time in long drawn out expositions.  Also the cinematography, camera angles and editing are worth noting. The scenes are cut in such a way that it uses a theme to lead into one another using a very artistic flare. IE a candy wrapper, that we believe to be from Mrs. Kang's bag, floating across a parking lot to the feet of another character but at a different moment than we expected.

Song Hye-kyo delivers one of the most chilling yet subtle performances in modern Korean drama history. The way trauma is explored here is brutal, yet beautifully constructed. Every scene feels deliberate, every line a wound or a weapon.  The writing balances tension with grace, slowly peeling back layers of the protagonist's pain while critiquing society's blind eye to bullying and systemic abuse. It's a painful watch, but not in vain - it heals as much as it hurts. If you want a show that leaves you silent at the end, this is it."

The young evil actress Shin Ye-Eun is extremely talented, charismatic and good to the point that I wish she acted in both roles. Song Hye-Kyo was average in that role and no chemistry between her and Lee Do-Hyun.  Yum Hye-Ran was excellent and her story was very emotional.  The end of the revenge was a bit too easy and boring.

This series is a prime example that changes in the school system, at home and with law enforcement are necessary. Shaming and expulsion, fines and no chance at a future at this school, are needed.

But the same issues I've encountered with other Kdramas hold here: firstly, WAYY too drawn out. 16 1 hour episodes is wayyy too excessive for something that could have been told as a two-hour movie. The main antagonist girl is a ridiculous overactor (she'd be at home in Jdramas) and the main character tells sooooo many people about her revenge plot it just becomes absurd.

Through the positive description of the countless violence suffered by the protagonist and the scenes of scarring his body many times across the time latitude, the anger and helplessness of the protagonist and the cruelty of the perpetrators are more forcefully highlighted, which brings greater shock to the audience, and also makes the audience more deeply aware of the seriousness of campus violence and the harm it brings to people.

Typical revenge story where the main lead swears vengeance to her school bullies and supposedly prepares for decades for the perfect moment to attack.  While the premise is very electrifying and filled with very strong and emotional scenes, I was kinda disappointed with how the events where unpacking. Somehow I was expecting a more intelligent, cold and calculated plan. I was hoping for that explosive element of surprise but never came.  Dont get me wrong, still a very well written script, there were no holes and the execution was impeccable. I just have seen better revenge dramas.  But still amazing thrilling and powerful series to watch. Loved how it's bending traditional morality and values and Enjoyed very much how the compassion many dramas force into good traditional characters wasn't implemented here. I strongly believe bad people don't deserve forgiveness and I was thrilled to watch the lead's punishing every single one of those devils.  I did enjoy the romance between the leads ( although this is not a focus key in the story) , who became accomplices fighting for a justice that nit always has to come from a legal perspective but more from a peace of mind emotionally speaking.  I read a lot about these incidents happening in schools and It breaks my heart watching some of the scenes recreating all the tortures and bullying ( to the point I had to put my tv in mute) but it's necessary we see them so we can try and change the wicked society we live in."

I'm not type of revenge movie but i watch it second time while waiting for next season. Watch it you won't regret it for sure. Hope they have more season then just two. After all highly recommended.
더 글로리,The Glory,2022,7,,"The story as such is great. A woman seeks revenge for the harm done to her in high school. Her plan is for the long term and requires patience and intelligence. The actor playing her role performs very well, as does her helper/friend and the old lady houekeeper that come into play. The scenario is also fine, even if it is more elaborate than needed.  The latter results in some pointless scenes that hardly add to the story. Add to that the vast amount of simple, awkward and plain ridiculous dialogues, the overacting in some of the roles (especially the bad guys and girls), the ridiculous self-talk, the aloud reading of text messages (why?), I understand that Korean people are more expressive in their emotions than we are in the west. The hysteria of some of the characters however is just too much to take most of the times. In this series it was just bearable. It is not hard to conclude that this intelligent and captivating story could have been told so much better.  Despite all that however, there's enough in the story itself to keep you watching till the last episode. And ... the closer you get to the end, the better it gets with some really beautiful scenes. Not enough however for a 7+ rating."

더 글로리,The Glory,2022,7,,"""The Glory"" tells the story of a woman who was cruelly bullied at school and decided to dedicate her life to one thing - revenge on the perpetrators.  If you're expecting a series in which the good woman, full of a thirst for revenge, slaughters the perpetrators, then ""The Glory"" is the wrong place for you.  I found the premise of the series extremely interesting and was very excited to see how the planned revenge would be carried out, but I have to say that the series is just too long-winded for me personally. I have nothing against a story that takes its time with its embellishment, but here it's all pretty boring at times.  I also had a lot of trouble matching the names of the characters to certain faces. But I'm almost certain that this is only a problem because I'm not used to hearing Korean names and some of them sound pretty similar.  In my opinion, more could have been made of the series if the pace had been adjusted a bit, but it's definitely worth watching."

Some things just don't add up in this show. The rating people give is very surprising to me. Great concept but that's about it. This tv show would be better as a movie.

That kind of mother shouldn't exist!  18 years of planning, she should be prepared for any fallout. Even if her mother finds her, why let her into her life!  The 2nd part is awesome!

Speaking of Moon Dong-eon she is played to perfection by Song Hye-kyo; her performance was a massive part in being so hooked on the show. We found ourselves at many times aghast and cheering Dong-eon on as her well crafted plans play out.  Another stand out performance was that of Yeom Hye-ran as Kang Hyun-nam. Such a great comedy relief and a very heartfelt performance of the relationship with Dog-eon. I'd love to see a spin off comedy show with her as a private detective or something; blurred photos, baked eggs and kimchi included.  I would highly recommend this show, it's just amazing.

There are things that are very hard to swallow like: How the hell are girls abused, burned, in an open school gym? No help, no one says anything, this is very exaggerated. Even if bullying is VERY real, this part was pretty forced, because the damage to it was too visible to simply ignore.  The villains spend the entire series screaming at each other in ridiculous hysteria.  The end was sped up a bit in Dr. Joo Yeo-jung revenge. What a shame.  For me it's not fair to compare to Goblin or Eternal Monarch which are from the same director because those dramas have totally differents types of plot.  I give Glory drama a 7/10."
더 글로리,The Glory,2022,10,,"This is a gripping K-drama that blends revenge, trauma, and emotional redemption in a way that is both raw and poignant.  At its core, The Glory isn't just about revenge-it's about the lasting trauma that bullying leaves behind and the complex emotional journey of seeking justice in a system that often ignores or overlooks the pain of victims. The series paints a hauntingly realistic picture of the deep emotional and psychological wounds that remain after such experiences and the toll it takes on one's sense of self-worth.  The series critiques not only the actions of the bullies but also the systemic failure that allows such behavior to persist, offering a searing commentary on how society often ignores or downplays the long-term effects of such violence.  Through Dong-eun's journey, The Glory asks hard-hitting questions about justice-what it truly means, who deserves it, and how it can be achieved when the system is rigged. It also sheds light on the emotional resilience of those who survive trauma, showing that the road to healing is long and fraught with obstacles, but it's not impossible.  The writing is meticulous, weaving a web of intricate plots that keep you on the edge of your seat while the emotional intensity keeps you deeply invested in the characters' lives.  Song Hye-kyo's performance as Moon Dong-eun is nothing short of extraordinary. She brings vulnerability, rage, and calculated determination to the role, making Dong-eun a character you both empathize with and cheer for. The tension between her desire for revenge and the emotional cost it takes on her is incredibly well portrayed.  It's a dark, haunting drama that explores the consequences of a broken system while offering a fresh perspective on the concept of justice."

This particular drama misses the mark though, which is disappointing because the premise is fascinating. There is just wayyyy too much filler and unnecessary scenes. This could have easily been only 8 episodes and my opinion my have changed; however 16 was just far too many and there are episodes where you might feel like giving up on it entirely. If you're looking for a summer series out of boredom, give it a shot, but don't blame me for being bored and wanting to scream: OK, get on with it already!!"

The first episode was pretty gruesome and sadistic and it really set up the premise of revenge really well. But, the next 7 episodes after was just downhill. Introducing characters after characters, random plot lines and confusing scene edits and cuts. I was so angry that I invested so much time into this, that I tried to finish it, but stoped at episode 7, cos I couldn't take it anymore. The revenge plot is so slow and never picks up any pace. It's like watching paint dry. PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS SERIES. It's a massive time sink with no pay off. Also, the young characters in the first episode were so good and then the odler characters, especially the main lead was so horrible from there on. So frustrated!!!"

Moon and Kang's relationship is beautiful and the way the develop Kang's character is superb writing.

Song Hye-kyo's portrayal of Dong-eun is absolutely compelling, showing a woman who has been broken but is determined to reclaim her life and dignity. The series does an excellent job of building up the tension as Dong-eun carefully unravels the lives of her bullies, maintaining a suspenseful atmosphere throughout. The storytelling is paced well, allowing viewers to feel the weight of her suffering and the satisfaction of her revenge in equal measure.  That said, the plot can sometimes feel slightly predictable, especially for those familiar with revenge-driven narratives. However, the emotional resonance, combined with strong performances from the entire cast, makes ""The Glory"" a standout drama. The balance between vengeance and humanity is delicately maintained, leaving viewers conflicted yet empathetic toward Dong-eun's actions.

더 글로리,The Glory,2022,9,,"Usually in revenge stories where the victim lays out an elaborate plan to exact revenge years later, the protagonist would hide his/her true identity and motivation until the climax of the story when he/she is ready to strike the final, lethal blow on his/her perpetrators. In this case, despite being poor and powerless, our heroine has the guts to confront and taunt them face-to-face, ""your time is up"", with a deadly cool smile that sends shivers down their spine. If this is not class, I don't know what is.  This is modern Korean thriller at it's best. If the story were to take place in US, the victim of school violence (or torture to be precise) would likely just grab an assault rifle from home (for self-defense purposes only of couse) and shoot dead her tormenters. A much more efficient approach certainly but the drama would be over in one episode...

I mean sure revenge is a story we've all heard about before but I always like when they get creative. I feel like the next episodes will be just that.

I cannot wait for season 2 and I oftehn think of this show.  But it has a huge flaw: Season 1 is not complete. There is no wrap-up of the story, not only that not all questions are answered, but there is at least one major plotline being introduced. And that is done in a way that it may suggest there will be more than 2 seasons. This may not be all that bad, but streaming spoiled me, I'd rather binge than wait for months or years for continuing one story.  Also, in past few months I also liked and enjoyed two other shows (Yellowjackets, From) whose stories are just cut in half and we need to wait for next season.

You were drawn to the next episode, and I also felt that this series provided a great opportunity to show the talents of the actors more, especially the actor Jong Song Il. I think it is time for him to take on an absolute starring role in an upcoming drama. I removed a star from my restriction because of the scandalous and bold scenes. Which, in my opinion, will not detract from the value of the work if it does not exist in the first place. Also, the OST of the series is really beautiful.

더 글로리,The Glory,2022,7,,"A revenge drama can be hard to watch. Especially if you allow the fact that revenge is a poor basis for justice to interfere with your going with the flow of the drama. This series largely avoids that problem through the nasties being agents of their own downfall. The victim seeking revenge does not kill or maim her targets. She manipulates them into doing that to each other.  That is possible because the nasties are such awful people. Of course anyone who bullies to the extent they bullied the victim at school is likely to grow up to be an awful nasty, so I had no issue with that. More problematic for me was that they would continue as ""friends"" into adult life despite being so horrible to each other. Their constant abuse of each other was fertile ground on which the victim could sow sufficient discord for their group to implode.  I also felt that one or two of the revenge outcomes were a little too easy - for example the death of the abusive teacher required little effort from the victim.  The darkness of the storyline was partly redeemed by a love story - this is a kdrama after all! Gaining revenge did not give the victim her life back. She needed love to do that. If only she could have done it with the love but without the revenge."

Characters have no personalities or depth. Their motivations are never explored. Story has no twists or turns. If someone was and is a bully then how can they suddenly turn so meek! The guy who loves the lead actress is so stupid I can't even put in words.  Episode 1 was really really good though. It gave me great expectations so I kept on pushing till episode 7.

The plot follows an adult woman as she carefully plans revenge against her former bullies. There is a lot of time spent on building up the main character's backstory so the actual show doesn't gain traction until about episode 4. Unfortunately, this is where the plot runs into a bit of confusion with multiple characters, intersecting plots, and although the main character narrates some scenes, as a viewer I had to rely on plot summaries to explain everything else in scenes she wasn't in. Even with English subtitles, I still had to rewind to properly catch reactions to certain scenes. It's a good show that requires careful focus on its finer details."

First 8 episodes went like it was just 1 episode.  So smooth and interesting series.  Story is all about the revenge of botb the leads..but obviously only 2/16 for male, rest for the female.

And what i like about Glory, eventhough it looks gloomy, sad, a little bit depressing, and messy in some ways, it isn't energy draining like other similar genre, and as far as i can remember while binge watching, i never yawn or got bored because the pace is really balanced, not too slow nor too fast.

One minute they will blur it out, then the next you get full frontals. Yet they don't care to shy away from the violence. Why not just do it how ""High Society (2018), aka Sanglyusahoe"" did it?

I've had some pretty brutalized students but no bully victims like Moon Dong-Eun. It's a bit inconceivable that injuries as extensive as those portrayed in The Glory wouldn't attract an intervention. Also, I used to teach at a national university training students on track to become secondary school teachers.

The only redeeming point is Mrs Kang the cleaning lady. Best director? Best show? Please don't tell me corruption has reared its ugly head at the awards committee.

더 글로리,The Glory,2022,8,,"After watching the whole series, my impression is somewhat better than after the first eight episodes. Also, it is clear that although there are many inconsistencies in the story, especially in the police investigation, the whole plot should be seen primarily on a symbolic and metaphorical level. The relationships between the characters are well developed, and it is especially impressive to see how the characters themselves change as the story progresses and find themselves in new situations. This is especially true for Ha Do-Young.  The ending is a little melodramatic, but it fits well since the whole story is quite painful. Also, there is too much mixing of plot from different time periods which just makes it harder to follow.  All in all, a good series that is certainly not for those who want to watch something along the way for fun, but it is a good display of different characters with a special emphasis on evil people (that's the majority) who are irreparable until the end. No one had the slightest remorse for what they had done, but only felt sorry for themselves and looked to get out of their own problems regardless of who they hurt."

In standard KDrama TV fashion, it is FAR TOO LONG. Yes, I know they need the advertisement dollars, so the more the number of episodes the better. But my mid series, the intensity falls off dramatically, and it takes about 5 episodes to flesh out what could have been done in one episode. This is dulling to the senses and causes the shock value of the show to wear off.  Second, the ultimate ""revenges"" are Meh. Some better than others. But the main antagonist's fate wasn't anything we haven't seen in Korean crime shows before. I was expecting something jaw-dropping, but it doesn't happen. It is almost like the writers ran out of cool ideas during the build-up, realized they were dry, and rushed the conclusions over the last two episodes.  If there is a third season, I'm not optimistic that they can bring the magic back from the first season. They spent all their emotional ammo."

The show has an emotional component that is really good, as well as a comedic component and other elements of suspense and drama. It's not really a slow burner at all, every episode is interesting!! It does have build up and payoff.  So, some reviewers claim that it's boring or whatever because they like review bombing, but no, this this entire show was very good and I always wanted to know what happens next.

There are at least one or two huge moments per episode a la breaking bad, and I was absolutely locked in for every minute of it. I watched the last 5 episodes in one day because I just couldn't bring myself to put the show down. The pacing is immaculate and every single actor is putting on the performance of a lifetime.

더 글로리,The Glory,2022,7,,"The Glory"" is undeniably well-acted and beautifully produced, with a gripping narrative that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. However, the central theme of revenge raises significant concerns. While the protagonist's quest for vengeance is emotionally compelling, it normalizes and even glamorizes the idea of retaliating against past wrongs in harmful ways. This could send a problematic message to younger audiences that revenge is justified or heroic.  Instead of focusing on the cycle of revenge, it would have been more powerful to explore themes of healing, forgiveness, or overcoming trauma in a constructive manner. While the series excels in its storytelling and performances, it's crucial to reflect on the implications of its message and the potential impact on impressionable viewers.  Ultimately, ""The Glory"" is a compelling watch but should be viewed critically, especially regarding its moral undertones."
더 글로리,The Glory,2022,6,,"This is a ""revenge"" movie, and be forewarned, revenge is not terribly satisfying. A poor second to forget and move on.  The overall mood is somber, and some pretty gruesome stuff takes place. The main character was abused (really awfully) as a minor, and becomes highly focused upon retribution once she becomes an adult. She is adroit, a careful planner, and basically sets the predators up to trip over their own vicious natures and their proclivity to turn adversity into aggression including upon each other.  The story is not told in a linear fashion. Stuff happens, Then some backstory that proves illuminating and often surprising. And then again, and then again. It is engaging to never be completely sure you've got the full picture, and see your ideas of events get switched about.  If you are in the mood for a bit of puzzlement and ready for a grim take upon life, this series will work for you. It moves along, and has interesting performances.

One has to ask why she kept returning to the gym if the abuse was taking place there? Why go to meet two boys in the pouring rain on her own knowing they were abusers?  This part of the story made no sense at all.  The FL maintained her miserable expression throughout this series only breaking into laughter once. She is not good actress.  I did not admire the way she drew a young plastic surgeon into her scheme - especially as she had no particular feelings for him. Did it not matter to her that she could destroy his career and his life?  I had no admiration or sympathy for her - she could have easily avoided the abuse had she gone to the police or a lawyer.

Length of Korean shows are very long so, sometimes it's very hard to wait until it starting to gripe my attention and interest. This show was superb specially the story telling was extremely well, it's gripping and full of entertainment. Acting is top notch specially from the lead actor and actress.

The Glory follows a group of people who went to high school together and their complex relationships later in life. We see many flashbacks to their life in high school, mostly bullying scenes that are heartbreaking to watch, but executed really well. The acting in this series is overall really great, especially from the bullies, there's just something so raw and almost eerie in their delivery.  The complex characters and their complex relationships are very interesting to follow. This series does a great job at making you feel momentary sympathy for certain characters, only to make you question that seconds later."

더 글로리,The Glory,2022,8,,"The Glory is a great watch, gripping your attention from the very start to the finish. Dong Eun, a victim of school bullying (or, to be more accurate, torturing), decides to take revenge on her bullies. I really loved how there was no romanticizing of revenge- she dedicates her entire life to it. There is no happiness about getting revenge, either, and that is very clearly shown.  The cast: brilliant. Song Hye Kyo has a long successful career behind her and has yet again managed to prove herself as a standard in the industry. But other actors don't lag behind for a single second. Lim Ji Yeon (in the series Park Yeon Jin) has delivered possibly a performance of her career. Everyone else, including the little girl playing Ye Sol- brilliant.  The entire story, the plot twists, it keeps your attention constant throughout the series. I left it only with 8 stars because I am honestly horrified with what ease the school violence scenes are depicted in Korean shows. It's not just this show- to me it really is alarming in general how prominent school bullying is in kdramas and how far it can get. I understand raising awareness, but I am not entirely sure if this is the way to go about it. A warning to the future viewer, it can get quite disturbing.  Overall- I would recommend this to anyone!"
더 글로리,The Glory,2022,4,,"Edit 3/17/23  Season 1 opinion: Being that I've lived in South Korea for over 4 years now, I can say revenge dramas are a dime a dozen. There's always one playing on TV, and some of them are moderately interesting.  This one is by far the worst of any I've seen. If you put me in a coma, my acting would be equal to the main character. The female characters are catty, shallow psychopaths, and the male characters are complete simps, willing to do anything, and I mean anything, for a bland, soulless woman who is wholly uninterested in talking with anybody. The one older lady, who also stars in The Uncanny Counter (an action drama), is the only one that stands out as likeable and with acting skills.  The injustice part of the plot seems pretty unbelievable and gratuitous. The rest of the time, literally nothing happens. The main character just teaches a class, ghosts simps, and stands on her balcony eating a sandwich. How on Earth did they make a show out of this, for one, and how did anybody enjoy it? I gave it two stars because I was so disinterested in the story that I was able to use it for Korean listening practice without getting drawn in by the plot.  Season 2 opinion: Better than season 1, but still plenty of plot holes, strange editing choices, and confusing plot lines, I kept trying to figure out who was who, and why they were in the story. Some plot lines fizzle out unresolved, I would guess, because there were too many to keep track of.  That being said, a least things happen in this season, and in one episode, the main character had to do some acting, and she did fine. The character that played her mom, though...ugh. That was pretty rough.  To end on a good note, the cinematography team did a great job. I bumped it up from a 2/10 to 4/10 half because of them, and half because season 2 was an overall improvement."

The editing is at an excellent level, as well as the handling of the story, which was not easy, given the number of characters it has to explore.  It has a typical issue of K-Dramas, as it could very well have been condensed into 12 episodes, given the amount of side plots and the insistence on not resolving some of these storylines earlier. It is also contrived in the way it resolves many situations.  However, it is easy to forgive this when the acting is sooo strong (the main heroine and the main villain are amazing, but not only them) and the story manages to engage us so intensely, touching on essential societal issues (not only bullying and associated traumas but also social inequalities, corruption and relationships).  Nevertheless, I still can't see how a second season won't be a case of diminishing returns."

The series over sixteen episodes sees her enact revenge on those people who are still the same and are unchanged characters. The acting is top notch from the entire cast and the casting director did an amazing job picking the actors playing the adults in their youth. The plot cleverly looks back frequently at the tormentors to ensure you remain angry at the injustice and cheer on the poor victim who will go to any lengths to achieve what she considers justice. The only criticism I have would be that at times it felt a little cobbled together to go from scenario to scenario. Overall a superbly acted revenge drama which may leave you empty but satisfied.

I know the main character is Moon Dong-eun but Park Ji-yeon excels at being the villain and stealing the spotlight. The writing was solid but there were some minor things that I didn't understand towards the end. However they were so minor that they didn't impact my experience watching this show.  The progression of the plot and Moon Dong-eun's revenge coming into place was so satisfying to watch. Everyone who had wronged her had met an ending that they deserved. But what I liked about this is that the protagonist didn't always win on her path to revenge. She got some hits from the antagonists too. Her romance with Yeo-jeong was okay, it was unorthodox by typical K-drama standards but it worked for them. Will there be a season 2? Because I will be tuning in for that!"

Not just with the usual slapping, hair-pulling or public shaming, but with means that would leave lasting marks all over her body. After realizing that even the school administration not only could not help her, but would even join in the bullying, she dropped out. She worked menial jobs to get an education degree and save money towards a revenge plan.  In the meantime, her bullies went on to lead comfortable lives - a famous weather forecaster of a broadcast station with a sweet daughter and a CEO husband, a golf course executive and his lackey, a famous artist, an airline stewardess and an awarded school administrator.  The story is intense. The bullying is horrific, making me wonder whether Korean kids are really this mean, having watched similar bullying scenes in The Penthouse and other kdramas. However, I haven't gotten drawn into any character as much as I would have wanted to. And after watching a seemingly endless parade of revenge-centric dramas, I am getting bored with this plot device. I was actually surprised at how revenge-driven this is, making it rather archaic. Even Chinese dramas, known for revenge plots, are now depicting stories that advocate love, peace and forgiveness.  With a protagonist that has so much hatred in her as to hatch such a revenge plan, I doubt she can really love anybody, thus, I find any ""love"" angle in this drama implausible.  I am still giving this a decent rating as the revenge was done not only for the protagonist's sake but also to serve justice for the murder of another bullying victim, though it begs the question: did the protagonist use the other girl's death to avenge herself?"

You will not regret watching it, this drama is short but each episode felt right in timing, sequence and storytelling.  Song Hye-kyo is an amazing actress and this drama proves it.

She's literally perfect in the way she's written and acted. She's brilliant, lowkey terrifying, heartbreaking, and I love her so much. Watching her go through everything, carrying so much pain but still pushing forward... it's insane. The way she outsmarts people, plans everything, but still has these moments where you see her vulnerability... it broke me.  Also, the side characters? So much depth. You feel why they act the way they do, even the ones you hate. Some scenes made me laugh, some made me cry, and some made me want to throw my tv across the room. I did not expect to be this emotionally exhausted watching a show.  If you like emotional, intense, crazy good acting and storytelling, absolutely watch this.

But let's be real did they really need to swear in almost every sentence? It felt like they were using the same three swear words over and over. For some characters, it made sense they had that kind of personality but when everyone is constantly swearing, it starts to feel forced and unnatural. After a while, it got a bit annoying.  And let's not forget the violent scenes there were so many uncomfortable moments. Honestly, it was often too much for me, and I ended up skipping through parts. It didn't ruin the show, but those scenes were definitely hard to watch.  That said, it's still a fantastic show.

So, The first 2-3 episodes were hard to watch.  Why? The plot is sad. It is dark, painful. The ""bad guy"" characters are so evil. On the other side, the good ones are all broken ones, dead inside, filled with pain, anger, and they are lost souls. They are empty shells. It's so hard to love any of the characters, so you think this one is an overhyped series.  Then... suddenly... you are sucked in and found yourself in the fan club of supporters because the story is well written. It is systematic, there is logic, no glitches, no out-of-character behaviour.  After the story starts to move it is hard to stop watching it. The whole story is going like a 40-tonne loose truck on the slope with no brakes . You know everybody will die, but you wanna see it!  Final verdict? Well, It is a well-written and well-made series. All the actors have enjoyed this series and nailed it!  For me, it is not 10/10 only because it is hard to love the ""good"" characters because they are not good people. Revenge is not a right feeling it is not for kind, peaceful people. In the end, I felt like the detective in charge when she released the female lead: ""I don't like what you have done, but I cannot judge you, there are worse things in this world...""  Still, if you watch this series like me, you will hope one day they will find peace and happiness too.  Yeah, there are sad stories with no real happy ending and it is good we have that way!

더 글로리,The Glory,2022,,,"In no way am I trying to diminish real-life Korean school violence, but The Glory portrays the social issue in an unrealistic manner that makes you question what kind of message the show is really trying to push.  Firstly, almost all of the villains are written as your stereotypical, one-dimensional bad guy. The villains are so cartoonishly evil that it almost feels like satire. Typical attractive, rich, snotty mean people with no redeeming qualities. However, there are a couple characters that I think were written slightly better with more realism.  The show relies on a lot of shock factor (non consensual and consensual sex, affairs, domestic abuse, nudity, drugs, ped0philia, violence etc) to grab your attention, but the plot is predictable. The romance between the female and male lead was so cliche; I found myself skipping through their cringey romance scenes.  I do admit that despite the predictability, I found the main character's revenge scheme to be interesting and kept me hooked. However, I was frustrated at times by the obvious sloppiness of her plans. If it weren't for her plot armor, she would've gotten herself in trouble trying to execute this plan.  On another note, the cast did a good job portraying the characters, even if I disliked some of the writing.  Overall, the lack of realism of a drama supposedly based on real life stories impacts the enjoyability. The Glory is fine to watch purely for the entertainment factor, but I feel like there was a big missed opportunity to explore deeper themes and gray morality. It's a decent thriller but it lacks insightful social commentary. Basically... bully = bad. Revenge = good."

For instance Yeo Jung the doctor , I'm not sure what his story has to do with Dong Eun's other then being her headsman, but I'm sure he will be be the one in prison or doing the killing since he has a past trauma as well.

So many moments of fist clenching, teeth grinding, anger fuming, tears rolling throughout the series. This series depicted the norm of the world especially the vast contrast of those who have wealth and power versus those in poverty and marginalized and even in both, there are bound to be light and darkness that seemingly have their own way of justice and i can just say that i am soooo satisfied with the justice that have taken place in this series, well, at least in my head.

High-school bullying and its scarring repercussions is always an unsettling, chilling presence in Korean dramas. While serving as the uncomfortable backstory, The Glory also provides a rather keen insight into the torments of Don-Eung and how it made her vengeful towards her perpetrators.  The Glory pragmatically asserts how extremely bullied people carry the scars from those experiences in life. The cast has done a good work indeed along with the teen ones as well.

Dong-eun has been left with physical scars but she knows Yeon-jin is responsible for another girl's death. To aid her in her mission Dong-eun enlists the help of Kang Hyeon-nam, a victim of domestic violence.  I found this to be a gripping, if somewhat gruelling drama. Thankfully the most disturbing events take place in the opening episode so if you can make it past these you should be okay. The characters are interesting; plenty are clearly villainous but the 'good' ones have a degree of moral ambiguity. There aren't too many laughs to be had but those that are come from Hyeon-nam as she attempts to get information on Dong-eun's targets. The cast does a really fine job making their characters believable even if occasionally the antagonists slip into pantomime villain territory. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of darker toned Korean drama.  These comments are based on watching the series in Korean with English subtitles."
더 글로리,The Glory,2022,6,,"This is a good story. Perhaps even a great story. But it is a mediocre TV-series. Let me explain: the series attempt the 'reverse conspiracy' trope (à la Cruel Intentions and/or Liaisons Dangereuses). We follow a scheming hero ensnaring their victim, rather than one fighting to escape the trap laid by powerful enemies. This is a type of plot I am fond of, and one difficult to pull off (see Rabbit Hole, with Kiefer Sutherland, a couple of years ago, for an egregious example of failure.) And undoubtedly the writers did a very good job with their premise: as in a murder mystery, the cast of characters are established from the get go, and we follow the protagonist as she works behind the scenes to bring about their downfall. The script manages to remain suspenseful, eventful and coherent, because evidently the writers had finished their scripts before the first episode got filmed (something, believe it or not, relatively rare for serials due to market pressures.) No less unusual, the format actually fit the script, and the large number of episodes actually testifies to a complex intrigue rather than Netflix wanting to milk it.  And yet, and yet... story aside, this is not great TV. It suffers from the usual shortcomings of Korean series: a personality-deficit propped up with bland and glossy luxury; low-grade romantic melodrama with assorted super-cheesy soundtrack; too many dialogues, which are never heartfelt or perceptive; etc.  To some extent, Deo geullori seem somewhat aware of its cinematic crimes: Jeon Jae-joon's wardrobe is such an eyesore (all-over monograms, absurd detailing, eye-watering colour schemes, etc.) that this car crash cannot have been entirely an accident. Similarly, although the romance is cookie-cutter K-drama fare (cute but shy broke girl meet nice & funny rich bloke), there are some occasional attempts at social criticism. Still, Deo geullori ultimately remain a generous serving of celebrity worship by other means... like so much mainstream K-drama: the few working class characters (Kang Hyeon-nam and Moon Dong-eun's mother or her factory colleague) are all used and abused for comedic relief, leaving any clever scheming, romantic tension or tragic grandeur to the rich and beautiful.  On the whole it's worth a watch. Although I caught myself more than once thinking of what could have been made with this great story, I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The few times I have attempted to watch K-Drama I was nearly always dismayed by what seems like trash rolled in glitter. Here for a change, we have a very nice core. Too bad it is still rolled in glitter."

It's still very different, but it still feels trite. Not to mention, it can tonally lean a bit hokey and over-the-top, which I'd be all for if it were intentional.  Most of it has to do with the fact that every character feels like a caricature. The bullies especially lack any dimension or complexity, but it's an even bigger sin that so does the main character, Dong-eun. Yes, her coldness is forged from trauma, but she's so one-note about it that those moments of levity with her love interest or the abused mother character don't land.  So far I'm 10 episodes in and I'm finding it rather difficult to slog through the rest. I'm sure the writer found some elaborately clever, if not reaching way for Dong-eun to exact her revenge. I'll give it 5 stars for now, and if I care to finish, I'll add or take away a star depending on its ending, but I will not be recommending this to anyone...

I was wondering what's wrong with the Korean society that people opt for suicide for bullying. I mean, you can just leave and move away. Report to the authorities and move on with life. Too much young and even older lives are wasted, whether you are famous or not. (It's a society that puts too much effort on respect, you have to be careful with your speech and actions when you visit their territory- or it's all just a facade!)  But having watched The Glory (I can't believed i finished it in one day!), i saw and felt the victims anguished and how it tormented her for life. As much as I wanted to see her change and forget and have a life, I also wanted to see the perpetrators be punished- severely. It evokes emotions I thought I didn't have for such genre. The bullying scenes were necessary for skeptics like me to understand the depth of their agony.  That's when I realized the actors, the storyline and the cinematography were so so so good. It's brilliant. Now I understand why Song Hye Kyo was chosen, she brought the character to life and she has done well. Her sneers and retorts make me cheer silently - hoping somehow it comforted the character although she will show she's in pain yet determined. She cunningly (yet also genuinely) made me fall for the character. The other characters were skillfully played that I just got invested with their next actions.  Now, I can't wait for season 2."

Song Hye-Kyo is wonderful as the patient mastermind, who draws brilliant people into the plan. We love her. Go is an important theme for the series, and an important and vital analogy for everything that happens. Go unites players and through the game players form strong bonds. The principle of building houses is important and central. We love The Glory. The English dubbing was really well done as well."

The show is engaging, i find myself get hooked with the main character Dong-Eun and soon rooting for her success.  The political aspects to this is not so deep compared to game of thrones its light so requires no deep thinking. Its pretty straightforward.  The atmosphere is aesthetically pleasing, acting is decent.  Sometimes the adults act like college kids instead of adults. Their social circle is so small, basically just one friend group from high school, i would imagine they expand their network after highschool but this show didnt have that, maybe to keep the focus on the main characters.  It's not a show I regret watching, and I say that as a compliment."

Everything comes together so well to make a must see drama.  The acting is great. You end up disliking the baddies and end up invested in the main characters journey.  The story is well written and unfolds well. Each episode builds on the last. Will things work out the way we hope.  The production is first class.

더 글로리,The Glory,2022,8,,"The Glory: South Korean revenge thriller series which strays into the horror zone. Like many SK TV series' this has 16, hour long episodes which can prove a bit daunting even when the early episodes are quiet good. In this case it was split into two parts. The first i gave 9/10, the second 7/10. Truly disturbing school bullying involving physical abuse and bought off/indifferent teachers and police. It doesn't help that bullying victim Moon Dong-eun (Song Hye-kyo) has an alcoholic mother who is also easily bribed. The gang of bullies is led by Park Yeon-jin (Lim Ji-yeon) whose wealthy mother pays to cover her misdeeds even when she is responsible for the death of another student. The adult Dong-eun sets out to take revenge on the gang of bullies, confronting them, inserting herself into their lives. Naturally they fight back. A lot of psychological horror but there are some really disturbing scenes of violence. Shamanism also features with some impressive scenes of possession. A bit melodramatic at times, it could have been completed in less episodes but it is a convincing narrative with a good ensemble cast. Written by Kim Eun-sook and Directed by Ahn Gil-ho. Sixteen episodes on Netflix. 8/10."

A great start to a revenge TV series, which after 2 episodes turns into a long, occasionally stupid and screaming ordeal of boredom.  Don't get me wrong. The atmosphere, the shots and the main character's acting are excellent. Unfortunately, it's hard to shake the feeling that the story is pointlessly stretched out, that the acting of the supporting characters does not reach the level of the main character's acting and, last but not least, that some events are a bit stupid or. Thoughtlessly placed in a hurry.  I completely understand that revenge is a dish best served cold, but I still think that half fewer episodes and a little less screaming of the supporting characters would greatly help raise the qualitative level of this otherwise solid TV series."

Normally I hate flashbacks in a movie or series but in this story, well used. You can understand trauma behind of main character and it is really sad. Only one thing is annoying me about Korean series ; actors or actresses laugh so strange. It is so fake.. It is really good.

This drama, however, was full of realities. How severe abuse can change a person and rule their life without love and change. It was rated low mostly in its home country because it is better to not deal with such issues and they tend to be rated low if they're uncomfortable, but everywhere else, this was knocked out of the park.  The acting and story was believable, and even the side stories were good. Yes, it was harsh at times, especially the first episode, but I believe that its best to know these things really exist, instead of turning a blind eye, or they continue.

You get to know all the characters while also getting exciting plot developments every episode. I binged through this series quite quickly. (Even at work)  Throughout the revenge ploy, a romance sparks, which gives hint and hope at redemption for the protagonist victim... in a very K-drama way (guy would do anything for girl), which I think will appeal to a lot of female romantics.

The story of torture is hard to believe because girls and boys cannot be that cruel (obviously over-dramatized to generate greater satisfaction from revenge). After that, however, the show becomes much more watchable and engaging. The storytelling is excellent, with poignant and zappy dialogues-- both are a trademark of Kim Eun-Sook. She is a masterful writer who is undoubtedly one of the top five drama writers in Korea. The intriguing chemistry between Dong-Eun and Yeon-Jin's husband is very well-crafted. Nevertheless, I find the English translations inadequate, and thus, they fail to show the brilliance of writer Kim. This is too bad. I wouldn't say I liked all of Kim's dramas (e.g., the King: Eternal Monarch was unimpressive), but I like this one.

It feels so good to see her smile in the end, with the life she missed while chasing to reach the destiny of being... what she deserved. Yes, this becomes emotionally heavy in the end as she steps closer to what she wants, it was sad but thankfully it has a happy ending. I liked her executioner, that cute love story which really means a lot as you care for them. I wished to see his dark side but he was saved by his angel from getting burned in his own hell.

When it came to this one, skipping was the last thing I was planning on doing.  Now, I am not quite sure on who was in charge of the casting but that person did a really great job. The young actors looked just like their older versions!  The acting skills of the cast also really got to shine in this drama.  ~ Especially Song Hye Kyo, who has been bashed for her acting skills probably throughout her entire career, really popped off.

The story of the protagonist is not a nice one, and you grow to feel the same pain she felt and understand why she wants revenge. But the way she acts, the strategies she uses, with calm and focus, really are on another level. And be ready to get emotional when she finally finds the love of her life.

The acting isn't the best but a few characters have their moments. The storyline is sometimes choppy and takes a minute to put things together.

The older drama was a character-based show, with more attractive actors and a much more compelling story-line. This version (The Glory) must have been either script-stolen and partly disguised for sale to Netflix, or the producer may have privately paid for the rights to the script of Lucifer (didn't hear that in all the hype for this over-glorified and super-gory garbage). Watch both and you will see the same character types doing the almost exactly the same things, only with some variations in casting (sex switches for main characters, for example, to hide the steal) and the addition of the much discussed bullying torture scenes -- which confuse the earlier plot-line of Lucifer (creating an unneeded two motives for the main character) and make this (The Glory) story less plausible, likeable, and realistic (i.e., most of the characters in The Glory are total psychopaths or certainly lack all empathy -- which really does not work well in the story, whereas in the original Lucifer they were more believable, human, and even pitiable in many cases). Lucifer's plot was also more clever and original. The Glory is poorly conceived remake with less appeal and more plot points that don't make sense if one stops to think; it tries to distract viewers with scenes of tense confrontations that go nowhere and ultra graphic violence that is unnecessary and sickening.

This is the lowest rating I've given for any Kdrama on Netflix or any other streaming service. Absolutely no reason for the 2 nudish,nude scenes in Episode 13.

The writing though was not great. The characters were quite well developed but the story wasn't. It could have had some huge twists and turned in to this big ending but instead you just get trickle fed a revenge plot. As the synopsis reads very similar to that of Japanese film Confessions, where school teacher takes revenge, this was not even close to the scale of revenge satisfaction that film gave.  I guess my overall feeling at the end was I'd rather have watched Confessions again and saved 14 hours of my life.

Parasite is one of them. If this isn't a masterpiece, then I don't know what is.  I'm going to keep it vague on the plot-front, because I didn't know anything about it going in, and was really excited to see it progress and unfold in satisfying, unexpected ways.  What I will say is that this film, more than just about any other I've seen, put me through so many different emotional states during its 132-minute runtime, and did so without ever feeling muddled or tonally inconsistent. Parts of this movie were hilarious. Parts were heartbreaking. Other parts were insanely suspenseful (I'm honestly not sure if I've felt this close to the edge of my seat since the final season of Breaking Bad, way back in 2013).  And it does all this while being perfectly paced, beautifully directed, and amazingly acted from every single member of its cast. All the characters are understandable and sympathetic to some degree; the amount of conflict, drama and tension derived from a narrative with no clear heroes and villains is staggering. You come to care for just about all of them.  I'm stumped to come up with any flaws for this movie. And sure, I've seen many movies that are hard to fault, but it's rare that a movie appeals to me on a gut level and excites me to this degree while also being so close to technically perfect. It's extremely entertaining, thoroughly moving in so many different ways, and as icing on the cake there's a ton of social commentary and some heavy themes to chew on once the movie's over (and this one's not going to leave my head for a while, I can tell).  Catch this one when you can and believe the hype. Joon-Ho Bong has made many great films (and so far no bad one's), but this even manages to stand head and shoulders above all the others.

It really did have everything and it was strikingly good at all of them too.  I love a film that respects its audience. There are so many details in this movie that are crucially important and yet the film trusts its audience to notice them and acknowledge them without ramming them down our throats. There are a lot of layers to this film and I suspect for this reason its rewatch-ability factor will be very high.  The film was incredibly entertaining too. I can't think of a boring scene in this movie and yet on the surface for large parts of the film you would say not a lot is happening, at least in terms of action. Fascinating characters and brilliant dialogue are what create this. I had a great time with 'Parasite' and I think most that give it a chance will too."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"In a meritocracy, success and fortune are reserved for those who deserve it--those who develop solid plans according to their talents and abilities and who execute those plans through hard work and determination. Anyone can rise to the top, and for some lucky Cinderella, plucked from the cinders and gussied up in gowns, the meritocracy represents the heights of perfect egalitarian society: ""I started with nothing and ended up with everything I ever desired; you, too, can achieve you dreams, if only you try.""  The promise of unobstructed sunshine at the top of the mountain becomes justification for bitter competition, backstabbing, deceit, and callousness. You climb the crooked ladder until you make it to the straight one, and then, perhaps, when you at last feel secure, you can afford to be kind and confident and generous. ""It's easy to be nice when you're rich,"" the mother in this film (Jang Hye-jin) at one point observes.  But it's a very long and very crooked ladder, and sometimes the rungs give out beneath your grip, and sometimes they've been dangerously greased by those who climbed before you, and sometimes the ladder itself is simply kicked down--either by those above you or, just as often, by those staring up from the ground below. There are a lot of people trying to climb that one ladder.  But in a meritocracy, you can't blame the ladder or the other people trying to climb it. Nor can you blame the fact that all the good stuff is kept so many stories up instead of down at the ground where everyone can easily reach it. No, you must blame yourself. You should have tread more carefully. You should have climbed more quickly. You should have used a firmer and more precise grip, anticipated disasters, and known just when to leap. If you fail in a meritocracy, it's all your fault. You should have tried harder. Better luck next time.  Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik), the young man who is the main character of PARASITE, several times refers to ""metaphors,"" and the film itself is, of course, a metaphor. On a surface level, viewers are treated to a very thrilling, engaging, well-paced and well-plotted crime story. At all times, however, bubbling up from beneath the slick surface of this genre film, there are deeply personal, meaningful truths that should resonate with almost any viewer. These insights are rarely foregrounded. They are so subtly interwoven, in fact, that if you're like me, you may be completely surprised when the final shots of the film roll and you realize that you are emotionally devastated by the intimate, humanist story you've just witnessed. Bong Joon-ho's filmmaking is so extraordinary here that he'll make you fully invested in the lives of his characters without you even realizing he's done so.  I want to avoid spoilers here, but suffice it to say that PARASITE is a masterpiece--beautifully lensed, enthrallingly edited, superbly acted, and intimately involving.  South Korea has a population that is one sixth the size of the United States, and that population is stacked into skyscrapers in an area slightly smaller than the state of Kentucky. Higher education is widespread, so parents with means try to make their children stand above the pack by hiring them tutors and signing them up for extracurriculars and afterschool programs. I lived in Korea once, and the children I taught there were sometimes engaged in learning ten to twelve hours a day, six days a week--public school, English-immersion private school, piano class, soccer team, taekwondo, math camp, chess club, and so on. I routinely worked sixty to seventy hours a week on salary, but at bars I would meet young men my age who were expected to work far more than that, who slept at their desks so that they did not need to pry themselves from work for too long. As the father (Song Kang-ho) in the film at one point says, this is a country where fifty young men with college degrees apply for a mere security guard job. One can't afford not to struggle.  The themes of this story are not just localized to Korea, however. They are the story of global capitalism, and the specter of American materialism (and imperialism; note the ""Indians"") looms heavily over the film. Meritocracy makes cannibals of us all. It's nice to dream, and sometimes the dreamers who plan and struggle well enough can indeed climb out of the basement and into the sunshine, and how nice an ending it is when they do. But the film also makes it clear that sometimes all that planning and dreaming may be, maybe, just whims and fancy. More often, it seems, our pipe dreams are content to leave us with nothing more than the whiff of spewed sewage."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"This movie is a gosh darn masterpiece. It will make you belly laugh, it will chill you to the bone, and it will make you shed a tear. This movie will stay with you long after the credits are over.  If you plan on watching this movie, AVOID SPOILERS AT ALL COSTS."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,This is a well written and well perfomed original film. With a lot of repetitive cinema these day i felt this was something new. I felt connected and engaged with the character throughout the film. There are several well directed tense moments throughout the film. A popular topic of class struggled well portrayed. Its always nice to see foreign language films having worldwide success.
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,The most original film of 2019 and it is wickedly funny and darkly disturbing all at the same time. The narrative and the actors were excellent. One of the better endings of a movie in quite a while. Class warfare at its best.
기생충,Parasite,2019,,,"A poor family see an opportunity whenever their son starts tutoring English for a wealthy family - if they can engineer it, they can each get one of the jobs within the household. This is the basis for a film that starts out as a sort of con story, seeing the rich family as the 'marks'. As it plays out though, it keeps this assumption in the background, eating at the viewer as an idea, before then making it very relevant in the closing aspects of the plot. Between the start and then, the focus is on the various twists and turns of the drama itself. In this the film engages, and I found it easy to engage with it on the basis of what was happening.  The later develops do work better though when viewed in the context of the social aspect. There are lots of clever critics that can talk to you about the meaning and hidden depths of commentary from the film; for me the key one was the falseness of the 'con' itself. Although the family mock the gullibility of the rich family, it is not like they are stealing money from them, or somehow dislodging them from their position in life - no, they are just providing labour to them in exchange of comparatively low wages. They are doing this at the expense of other working people just trying to keep a job, and the rich family could probably not care less about the 'truth' as long as their needs continue to be met. This aspect is important for the direction of the later stages of the film, and adds sense to what happens and why, but it is interesting in and of itself. Technically the film looks great, and the director builds mood and tone well. Performances are strong across all the cast, but the turn from Song Kang Ho probably was my favourite as he was the most subtle and had the most space to shift across the running time.  There is a lot of talk for Oscar recognition, but it is a handsome, clever film and the timing in the year is right - I don't see it being the first foreign language film to win best picture, but this is more to do with the system than with the film. Regardless of awards or not, it is an engaging drama, with unusual developments, and built on top of an intelligent social aspect which links well to the direction of the narrative."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"As a film about a family imposing on another, and keeping dark secrets hidden beneath the surface, Parasite achieves what Jordan Peele set out to do with Us: tell a multi-layered story in a widely entertaining manner, but without sacrificing the believability of its central narrative.  That's not to say that Us is an ineffective film by any means, but when it comes to crafting weighty social commentaries under the guise of lighter fare, writer-director Bong Joon-ho is in a class of his own.  The film follows a lower-class South Korean family as they slowly integrate themselves in the lives of an upper-class family and their lavish household. As their entanglement is spun out of a web of deceit, the lowly family find themselves skating on thin ice when it comes to keeping up appearances.  It's a twisty satire on social-economic disparities in South Korean society that swings broadly in tone, and sometimes threatens to tip over the edge, but never feels less than meticulously calculated in its tonal shifts.  However, to reveal anything more about the story would be to take away from the overall experience, as each act is marked by a major plot twist or revelation that keeps the film one step ahead of the viewer at all times. Go in blind if you can and expect an unforgettable ride."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,Well written and performed also technically shines cinematography & bgm are too good and there's not even a single lag it's perfectly edited. Probably the best experience in recent times. Its pure art resembles the modern society the emotions they had shelved are insanely exceptional a layered masterpiece. If you like dark thrillers then you shouldn't miss Mr. Bong joon-ho's Parasite. Definitely tops the list of best movies in 2019.
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"It was entertaining, with good execution. But best picture?  Some people seem to love the fact that it switches masterfully between genres, which to me seems like something that would excite a movie geek or critic more than it would a regular viewer.  Others delight in the ambiguity of not quite knowing whom to root for - while that might distinguish it from a stereotypical ""american"" narrative it hardly elevates it to some exalted status. To its credit, I think the strongest feature of the film is that the director brilliantly manipulates the viewer's emotions by superimposing classically sympathetic elements onto the objectively non-virtuous and indeed villainous. What seems relatable and sympathetic in the moment is actually part of a pattern of deeply objectionable behavior, while what seems moderately dislikable is actually fairly mundane. This incongruity is layered on to brilliant effect.  Now, many are praising the supposedly deep, revelatory social commentary on the nature of class struggle, but I don't find it nearly as profound as is claimed. The overtly sensational, absurd plot if anything detracts from the relatability of a social message, and the storyline (even leaving aside the over-the-top scenes that are exaggerated for cinematic effect) is chock full of innumerable ordinary lapses, discontinuities and implausibilities to the point of distraction. More importantly, the characters are all minimally developed and characteristic of a one-sided view of the world in which people act out their base grievances and fantasies over a veneer of class-determinant normalcy. It strikes me that there is little to no consideration of virtue, even in momentary antithesis. Yet if this is the social revelation then it is a deeply cynical one, and also an implausible one because the world is not so one-sided and simple. For this reason, the film ends up revealing very little realistic insight into the human character or social dynamics. It is not a bad film as it is well executed and clever in its emotional manipulation, but I am not willing to dole out gushing praise."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Do you want to see a movie that will have your stomach in knots, anxious during many scenes? Do you want to see a movie that will have you conflicted on who you're rooting for? Regardless of your answers, see Parasite. Parasite ticks along quietly until it is booming in your ears. The symbolism varies. Sometimes it is obvious, Bong Joon-ho might as well have made the subtitles spell it out. But other times it is more subtle, and you might realize a connection or symbolism days or weeks after. Bong Joon-ho is a master at that. The conversation that it sparks is worth the $13-20 it costs to see the film. Parasite has made me think more than most films I've seen. Give it a watch, see it with friends or family and the dinner table will have a conversation overflowing with opinions and realizations."
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"The film is interesting, but that's about it. The first hour was really slow, the whole class thing seemed quite familiar. I'm not sure why people are falling over themselves about this film, maybe since it was Korean yet with an accessible story and familiar film language that it suddenly moved westerners to 'see the light'? Anyway, the second half twists and turns struck me more as a wacky story line I would have seen on a soap opera back in the day like Young and the Restless or Days of our Lives. Overall, I'm more critical of the critics than of the film. I recommend seeing this, it's worth a look but all the Oscars and 'best film of the decade' stuff is incomprehensible."
기생충,Parasite,2019,5,,"There are a few suspenseful scenes and a decent plot, along with comedic dialogue, but that's it. It's not a ""metaphorical masterpiece"" that some critics and users are saying. I feel as though too many people are trying to be expert critics like on that episode of South Park where the entire town writes crazy yelp reviews for all the restaurants."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"This is a movie about a class struggle in South Korea, like what movie ""Us"" attempts to do but done properly. It is a stark reminder of what true living standards for most South Koreans look like, and its realism is very painful. Few are aware of the fact that up to the 1980s, South Korea was in fact more impoverished than North Korea, and it was only late that the situation reversed with famines of the 90s etc, but many people still live miserable lives, and situation is very similar to that in China, where a few got gloriously rich but the urban masses still live in bug infested cheap dwellings.  Some crafty members of this underclass manage to con contemptuous rich man into employing them as his servants. For many Asians smell is a way to express utter contempt, and this is often directed against the white people, who, being able to process milk, smell ""like butter"" and are seen in rac ist light as unclean, but the same rac ist contempt is directed towards the poor. The poor accept these valuations and fight for the crumbles, like roaches in the dark, but in life and death situations, resentment might boil up and the contempt might cost the rich their empty heads.  The movie paints a sad picture of modern East Asian societies, with many subtle points, criticizes their culture and emulation of the America, with a few cruel but precise strokes. The sheer talent of the Korean filmmaker, but also the fact that West likes movies from foreign countries that are self bashing, allowing the worst condescension rooted in colonialism that failed miserably in East Asia to thrive, one more reason to cheer this slightly overrated movie."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"What an amazing film! Clearly an essay on the class divide. Writing lovable but nasty people is tough, but perfectly executed here.  They quite clearly cross the line, and when I mean ""they"" I mean bother the working class and the upper class. You could easily argue that ""parasite"" refers to one family trying to suck another family dry. Or that the upper class is draining the labour of the lower class, and expecting them to be grateful about it too! There is also something about the American Indian theme, a metaphor for dying cultural traditions which are being replaced by modernity? Nature is dog eat dog? Or is it a homage to an ""idyllic"" past where Native American culture was relatively classless?  Either way a must watch if you can handle subtitles!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"I found the movie entertaining. I was expecting more duplicity and schemes from the Kim family once they infiltrated the rich family. It moved slow at first but picked up pace towards the middle. While I was entertained, I was shocked that this movie won the 2019 Academy Award for Best Picture over the far superior 1917."
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"1.This movie is too over rated, I don't know, maybe it is something wrong with me because so many people appreciates this film superlatively...  2. All the characters are pathetically unlikable. They only show flaws. You don't want to be them; you don't want to be with them ... not at the beginning, nor in the middle, nor in the end.  3. This lowlife 4-member family was at bay and struggled to a barely survived condition, the husband/father was unemployed for a very long time, the wife was nothing but a mean heartless woman, the son and the daughter had failed the college entry exams for so many times. This helpless and hopeless family couldn't simply become a well practiced con-artist family overnight. If they were such great scammers, they would not have fallen so low and so helpless for such a long time. They don't have money to afford a dignified basic living standard. They would not be possible to suddenly become expert con-artist so easy and so soon.  4. I don't understand what the intention of the director is? What does he want to explain or to prove? Is it a critic of social inequalities? Is it a thriller? A comedy? I don't know and none of these styles is addressed adequately."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"Usually I don't read reviews before seeing a film. This one, however, I did, and happily so. First of all, it was good to know what cinema in Korea is all about. We need to shed our cultural biases, including ""how"" to make films. This had a very clever plot and an engaging group of characters. The title, I assume, means the principle figures have managed to infest a body and then use it to sustain themselves. I hope to see more from this director in the future."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Oh man, what can I say... How do I describe this jaw-dropping masterpiece in just few sentences?  PARASITE (not mistaken with that outstanding anime 'Parasyte') is a socially conscious themed film that masterfully wrapped in comedy and thriller. It's an exciting and surprising ride from start to finish. The tone shifting in the second part of the film is done brilliantly. Eventhough there's so much stuff happening, Bong didn't lose control of his storytelling.  Most of the scenes are sure very relatable for many in real life. On top of that, the ensemble cast (featuring my favorite Song Kang Ho) deliver a top notch Oscar-worthy performance.  PARASITE is the worthy winner of this year Palme d'Or (and I also hope it will do well at the Oscar - Best Picture worthy? for sure!)  It's the best film of the year, one of the best I've seen in this decade and for me it's arguably one of all time classic."
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"Following the step of Get Out, it is a powerful film that comprises of metaphors and allegories which need you to think beyond a certain level as they are manifested throughout. No worries, you will understand the film even if you fail to unlock the codes unlike Mother! & Us.  Parasite welcomes the audience into multi-genres and tonal shifts that mix and take its turn after every act. Pure comedy, dark comedy to heavy dramas, horror, thriller, mystery, you name it. The director, Bong Joon-Ho wonderfully converts them smoothly without letting the audience feels bizarre of the transformation.  With merely 10 characters into play, Parasite brilliantly executes layer after layer of interesting character developments which progresses the plot forward to ultimately produce a comprehensive film.  Parasite professionally handles cinematic tricks to synchronize every possible element for the greater good such as excellent use of cinematography techniques with superb artistic values, information-packed dialogues, lavish architecture production designs & vibrant colours.  Quite certain scenes feel a little too long and weary. If they can cut short and add new scenes instead, the pacing will be better and more entertaining.  Majestic musical set pieces is utilized in the background to help produce a richer tone to the distinct elements.  The suspenseful moments would have you at the edge of your seat without noticing until the point you recall your experience inside the hall.  Verdict: A strongly crafted masterpiece film on social themes and satire that finds its place in audience's heart.  In short, it is one of those episodes of Black Mirror."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,Good but definitely not worth an Oscar for best movie or best director.
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"This film doesn't allow easy reviewing because it has many aspects, many ways to look at. Is it thriller? Comedy? Drama? Societal critique? It's all of it; and therefore none of it. All in all, I was underwhelmed and mildly frustrated.  The style is there, I grant it. Cinematography is great. Acting is awkward at some points, but it's OK because of the partially comedy-like nature of this film.  But then, there is a problem with story telling. It builds up nicely toward the middle, where the parasites settle in their host and discover the secret down below. And then it makes an unexpected turn. It's alright to make a surprise at the end (I'd even say it's good), as long as it flows reasonably from the preceding story line. A reveal must make sense once it is revealed. This one didn't do the job convincingly for me. We are given very little clue about why people acted the way they did at the birthday party.  This film is just fine, but no masterpiece in my opinion. Some films are so easy to understand to the point of being insulting; others are so obscure to the point of being pointless. Great films do it just right somewhere in this spectrum. Unfortunately, this one is leaning to the pointlessness."
기생충,Parasite,2019,,,"This cinematographic gem has been recently rewarded by the prestigious Palme d'Or at the Cannes Festival. If I have one and only one advice to give you: go savor this fabulous movie with a strict minimum of information! Indeed, this film might schematically be split in two parts, the second one being quite surprising and unpredictable. The script is excellent and the casting is globally sumptuous, especially the gorgeous Cho Yeo-jeong for whom I may confess I have a crush.  As a postscript, an anecdote certainly insignificant but literally astonishing when you're French: in the middle of the film, the proletarian family gives itself up to an orgy, the coffee table being covered with manifold dishes including two French cheeses as industrial as cheap: « Le rustique » and « Bresse bleu ». Unbelievable!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"This Korean-language movie was such a contrast with the drivel Hollywood churns out. The story was great, the acting was great, and the director maintained tight control throughout. I must see more of Mr. Bong Joon Ho's work."
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"The movie Parasite is one of the many films that reinforce why people should give up this ridiculous thing of not watching foreign films. People are so scared of subtitles that they are missing out on some of the best films ever made. After 5 minutes of subtitles you get used to it and don't even realise you're reading.  Anyway back to this movie. Parasite is a fantastic film that really has no set genre as you will experience a drama, thriller, romance and horror all in one! Unlike most films you actually can sympathise with 99% of the characters even if they are seen as more of a villain. I wont give anything away but I will say that Parasite is a must watch and one of the best movies of 2019!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"This was one of my favourite films, great acting, I liked the characters and there was lots of suspense."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"It isn't every day that you come across a movie like this, a practically flawless one in my opinion actually. I have nothing but praise for director Bong Joon-Ho and I can now see why this movie has received much hype and praise over the past few months. This is a movie which not only shows a contrast between the rich and the poor but also the human condition and the will to survive. Don't worry, this review won't have any spoilers whatsoever.  To begin this praise train I have to first and foremost praise the acting of lead actor Choi Woo-shik whom delivered an incredible performance throughout this movie and brings a sort of charm during the first act of the movie.Another standout would be Kang-Ho Song that remains a recurring cast in the movies directed by Bong Joon-Ho and his consistency in the various movies he has directed absolutely shows why the director has so much trust in his acting capabilities.  A transition scene in particular which occurs at the end of the second act is really a beauty in itself and the transitions were absolutely stunning and beautiful which brings me to the cinematography and movie editing of the movie. The pacing was consistently on point where everything, even the change in tone is seamless. Along with the cinematography in which this movie is beautifully shot from the aesthetically pleasing rich kid house down to the semi-basement house in the suburbs.  Furthermore, another beauty of this movie will definitely be the score which was composed by Jung Jae-il which manages to convey emotion and tension during the second and third act of the movie which is something truly remarkable. Through music there are also hints to the sudden sort of change in tone I shall say which begins within just about the middle of the second act of the movie.  The plot of this movie is something I've yet to see over the many years of watching movies and this is where praised should be absolutely given for this ambitious plot where I could simply say, nothing written and the direction of this movie which keeps you guessing as to what this movie really is about should you dive deeper than the way the movie was promoted within the trailers shown for it. It is nothing short of extraordinary as you are unable to really see the change in tone coming.  At the end of the day, this movie questions how the rich could help the poor and in fact portrays mankind's strive for survival which in this case would be a better life in such a way that it isn't in your face. Plus, by the end of the movie, you really realise there is no real protagonist or antagonist, just people. People trying to live a happier life.  Thus, making Parasite the perfect movie where I am unable to criticise a single thing in this movie. Director Bong Joon-Ho has definitely earned my trust in his artwork and should to some extent be placed amongst the greats."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Finally saw this much talked about film. As a fan of Korean thrillers, this film surpassed my expectations. The film is about a poor family who cleverly n cunningly become employed by a wealthy couple, posing as unrelated, highly qualified individuals.  The film begins like a dark satire, it then proceeds into a captivating thriller n ends like a surreal crime.  The film is very entertaining inspite of the sad stuff shown about poor fellas but mind u, it is not at all demeaning. It is very gripping n weirdly hilarious."
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"Parasite (2019)  With the hype around this movie (""best in ten years"") I had unreasonable expectations. This is a funny, almost silly story with great acting, and with a couple of twists that make it inventive. It's also filmed (photographed) with gorgeous care, lots of gently moving camera, a lot of planning of shots from one to the next to tell the story visually. It's an example of classic great moviemaking. I thought the acting was especially sharp, like the complex job the leading woman, Yeo-jeong Jo, had of seeming a bit ditzy and selfish and yet not completely lost at sea. And the rest of the cast played types that didn't tumble into stereotypes. The story was smart enough to give them room to be complex, but this isn't a probing complex movie, actually. The content is in the improbable situation and how it leads, almost in a Chaplin-like building of absurdities, to comic tension. The cameraman, Kyung-pyo Hong, deserves credit, for sure, because he holds the visual structure together in a range of scenes-racing down dingy steps, a downpour in the slums, and graceful geometry in the fabulous house. Director Bong Joon Ho deserves the praise he is getting. That said, the next thoughts are more a reaction to the praise it's been getting: there are more impressive movies out there in various ways. Even just this year there are movies that have movied me more, or made me laugh more, or were more inventive. (I'm not naming movies.) Maybe since this movie manages all three it's notable, but I'll keep my admiration in place! Enjoy it!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"Before I attempt to justify the reasoning for my rating, I must provide a disclaimer professing my appreciation for Bong Joon-Ho's past work. ""Snowpiercer"" was the film that marked him on the map and allowed me to discover his other films, which turned out to be every bit as great as Snowpiercer was. I'm a huge fan of his, and I was extremely thrilled to hear of his unanimous Palme d'Or win. He's a great filmmaker and has the experience to show for it, and I'd say winning that award had been a long time coming for him. However, after my boundless anticipation for this film, and finally getting the chance to actually watch it, I was inevitably itching with a feeling of disappointment.  I've read many reviews of this film, all of them flooded with unworthy praise. Many people have stated that this is one of the best films of the past decade, filled with ""metaphors and allegories which need you to think beyond a certain level as they are manifested throughout."" Others have stated that the film takes numerous twists and turns, and unfolds in ""satisfying, unexpected ways,"" leaving the viewer wondering what's gonna happen next. The former sentiment's mention of ""metaphors and allegories,"" and the way they are presented in this film, have been done countless times over the course of mankind's brief existence, and class conflict has been a recurring theme in anecdotes for centuries even before Marx introduced his theory, yet people still find this elementary concept somehow elusive. There's only one dramatic moment that could be deemed a ""twist"" in the film, which ultimately wasn't that surprising given the endless amount of times this corporeal narrative device has been used since the dawn of storytelling. Besides that moment, everything is utterly predictable. I don't understand how people can act like the film is some unprecedented feat which challenges themes never challenged before. Seemingly every Hollywood blockbuster thriller presents a concept not that dissimilar from the concepts utilized by Bong Joon-Ho for this film.  Additionally, ""Parasite"" suffers from glaring screenwriting issues, the most blatant one being an over-reliance on convenient narrative tools to artificially move the story forward, rather than letting it flow naturally. I'm not going to spoil what exactly happens, but as an example, there's a certain set of stairs in the film that acts as the focal point for the story's progression. Characters make uncharacteristic mistakes that are beyond the realm of believability, which sacrifices the film's sense of authenticity and causes the tension to feel forced. Using gimmicky writer's tricks like this can make or break a film, and if anything, it shows a sign of sheer laziness from everyone involved in the screenwriting process, Bong Joon-Ho obviously included.  Creativity is another criterion that I exceptionally value when judging a film, and ""Parasite"" lacks in that department as well. Simply put, it's a perfectly capable film made by a perfectly capable director. Nothing more, nothing less. On the absolute surface level, it's a supremely entertaining movie, and if you're typically non-analytical and you prefer shutting your brain off before watching a movie, then this might actually be a great popcorn flick for you. But as far as the artistry goes, there's nothing to really be had with this film. Bong Joon-Ho's prowess behind and in-front of the camera was to be expected: The performances, the cinematography, the quirky lines of dialogue, etc. But with the exception of the expected, every aspect of this film is totally unchallenging and risk-averse.  All in all, I'm still content with Bong Joon-Ho's Palme d'Or win, more so for the excellence of his early work than for the film that actually got awarded. Do I think there may have been some politics/hidden agenda involved behind the scenes at Cannes? Possibly, especially considering the flak he got two years ago due to ""Okja"" and its affiliation with Netflix. Regardless, in the grand scheme of his filmography, I'd rate ""Parasite"" towards the bottom rung in his otherwise exemplary résumé. And if you're curious, I'd rate ""Memories of Murder"" and ""Mother"" at the tippy top, which shouldn't come as a surprise."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,This movie had it all. The premise was so strange and unique. I never knew what was going to happen next. It touched on important issues around class and family. Overall just excellent. One of the few movies that deserves 10 stars
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"The film is ok but that's as far as I go. It's worth a watch but only a score of 6 for me. It's not a masterpiece, it's not film of the decade it's not even film of the year. I don't understand how people can give it 10, 10 is a perfect score. 10 is unachievable in my opinion as nothing is perfect."
기생충,Parasite,2019,5,,"From the first scene this movie reminded me of Almodovar, but without the required intelligent effort to make it a credible story. Metaphorical? Yes and no, that's where they lost me. The pace seems fast, but then I found myself wanting to fast forward a number of times, since the overly simplistic plot turn into absurd rather too quickly. If this is the best movie of the year then Hollywood has a very serious problem."
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"From my exposure to Korean Drama/Horror I know that something at some point will go horribly wrong and the end there is no happy end for nobody. And yet this was so unexpected when I watch this movie. Great drama, 8/10."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"Director Bong Joon-ho's global sensation, Parasite, is an allegorical tale of class warfare. Before watching the film, I was familiar with its high praise but knew little of its actual plot. If possible, I'd recommend other viewers similarly go into this one as cold as they can. While Parasite deals with heavy themes (economic mobility, climate change), it does so in ways that are constantly entertaining and surprising. A unique blend of drama, suspense, comedy, and horror, Parasite provides further proof that cinema is a truly universal language."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"In our current era of film, it is commonplace to take a moral stance. Whether that stance is on human struggles, political processes, or social conditioning, the stance prevails, and we as the audience have to make our decision while we watch the film on whether or not we agree with the points being brought to us. Films like Elysium, Little Women, 1917, these all wear their moral stance on their sleeve.  Parasite does it differently. The film opens in a way that makes you think the morality of the film will be open and obvious for you, so that you don't have to think too hard about the minutia to feel confident in your morals while watching it. You think you know who to root for, and who is the ""bad guy"".  As you keep watching, Parasite continually pushes your sense of morals, prodding you with the question ""how far is too far?"" and ""how bad is too bad?"". These questions never give you a break, never give you time to come to terms with your answer as Bong Joon Ho continually ramps up the tension until you feel as though your heart will stop in it's tracks.  Parasite poses a moral stance with great nuance and care."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Possibly the best film I've seen for some time, yes I have a few lockdown blues, and needed something to cause a bit of escapism, Parasite was the answer. It's one of those films that's almost impossibility to classify, it doesn't really fit into any specific genre, but covers almost all of them.  A great start, it holds your attention incredibly well, I enjoyed the latter stages as much as the first part of the film, I know some didn't. It just moves you into a totally different place.  You'll laugh, and cry, you'll lose yourself in the wonder. Do yourself a favour and order it, 10/10."
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"Parasite is a fantastic movie that features sympathetic, yet morally gray characters and their plight to earn enough money to live. Despite the awful things the characters do, you feel for each and every one of them thanks to the fantastic writing and acting. The humour is also fantastic and always lands. Seriously, despite being a drama, Parasite is one of the funniest movies I've seen all year. However, the reason why I can't say that Parasite is one of 2019's best movies is the ending. The ending is so anticlimactic, disappointing and dissatisfying. It didn't feel like that was what the film was building towards at all. However, I still recommend Parasite as it's mostly a fantastic experience that I just wish had a stronger conclusion."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"The only thing i would change on it ,is the end... , why the hell all that had to happen, the movie would be great with a different end.  Overall this is quit intresting to watch... , to understand the culture , the limits between poverty and rich people , there is more but i don't want to spoiler it , so it worth to watch.  The movie ended in hurry somehow ,not showing the life of Kim Ki-woo , i like that for the first time i see quality into this korean/chinese/japanese culture movies recorded .  This movie is pure fiction , but is not feeling like it couldn't become a real thingh , because doesn't look that unrealistic to happen .  I note it for 9 , because i would give it a different ending and a part 2 ! ,but maybe the director of the movie didn't had same vision as us tend to have .. , he wanted something sad to happen and the movie to don't end in just a happy end."
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,It was not that good and not that bad for me. It's quite boring in middle of the movie but at the end it was good.
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"I had to leave a comment because I have no idea how this movie received an 8.5 rating. 6 range at best. As far as Korean masterpieces go I thought ""The Handmaiden"" and ""The Housemaid"" were far better stories about class. The script had tremendous ideas and I was looking forward to them ... and then they just dropped off and switched to a new plot. It felt very messy. There were scenes that had no follow up or no point. Like they had to fill a plot hole last minute. If hours of this film were cut, that would make sense. It felt like it couldn't decide if it wanted to be a dark drama, or a dark comedy. If it wanted to be just a family friendly dark comedy, you went too far, if you wanted to be a intense drama, you really dropped the ball. It felt like the director wanted to appeal to a wider audience by playing it safe. The more I think about it, the less respect I seem to have for its ""artistic"" merrit. Absolutely Overrated.  As I'm reading throught the miles of reviews, I'm convinced these are westerners who just started watching foreign films this year, or they're all paid. The common theme is people seem to think they are incredibly intelligent for having watched this. Another reviewer commented this is the SAME exact plot as ""Married with Children"" even down to Chicago, Illinois being a factor. Just blew my mind and now I have even less respect for the script."
기생충,Parasite,2019,4,,"I wanted really to liked it ,but I couldn't. I liked only the last scene ,but I could not like any of the characters. I don't know if that was the purpose ,but for me at least one character has to be likeable. And all the poor-rich thing has been told better from soap operas."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Glad I watched all the other best picture noms first because now I KNOW they all pale in comparison to this one ... I couldn't even move for like the last hour, and the last 20 minutes my hands were over my mouth and didn't drop once.  A masterpiece."
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"So happy i managed to see this movie with NO IDEA what was to come, though the trailers were a strong indication of what was to come. I wish i didn't have to rely on subtitles, knowing there are many subtleties you miss with limited translation. Ater some time for reflection, this movie reminds me of 'shoplifters,' another excellent movie that reflects on unconventional familial love."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,This movie surprises you by every new scene. I couldn't say what genre the movie is but it delivers a whole experience. I had no idea what the movie is about in the beginning but it is worth it. Shows perfectly in a dramatical and comedian way the differences between rich and poor
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Simply put, there's no way to explain what a masterpiece of satisfaction this movie is. Just watch it. I don't even want to explain what it's about...I think it's best if you just blindly go into it. Completely expect it to win best foreign film at the oscars."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,I watched this movie. it's a good movie but i couldn't understand how it won the best picture. i think this movie doesn't deserve that for sure.
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,Didn't expect the ending...which is why I enjoyed it. Shades of the cult classic 'Old Boy' in the sense that there were elements that were so disturbing..
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"The start and end felt rushed, but the film was generally enjoyable. Not sure why it was hyped quite so much, but definitely worth a watch, but it's unlikely to be a film I return to watch again."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"It was a wonderful movie, truly! I did not expect that level of acting and the way the movie was shot really stands out. It was, amazingly enough, filled with humor (both dark and stupid humor, the whole room was straight out laughing at some points! ), love, hate and passion in a way that I cannot describe. I jumped and screamed in my seat several times and by the time i left the movie theater my heart was pumping in my chest and I felt like I just had completed a marathon. My head is still spinning from all the plot twist, that I did not see coming! 10/10 would always recommend and hope to see it again soon!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"It was a great movie, a metaphorical pun intended to show the differences and/or similarities between the two major classes of the society, i.e. the rich and the poor. It has an extravagant climax which will not be liked by majority. However, the climax was justified afterwards. It was a great drama. I enjoyed watching it. Once the movie gears the pace, it was impossible to leave your seat without watching it full at one go."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,This movie surprised me by being near perfect. Struggle to place this movie in a genre as it is diverse and bring in a lot of themes. they nail the humour aswell as some of the deeper moments.
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,Looks like a few people failed to grasp the films message. It's a more cerebral watch than their intellect can handle. Ha ha.  A dark dramatic black comedy film with a strong social commentary.  Hugely enjoyable and well deserving of its many accolades.  See it now before Hollywood tries to remake it and ruins its excellence. A fabulous director.
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"This movie just changed my whole opinion about what korean movies can do! It was excellent, surprising and it is going to steak in my mind for a very long time! One of the best movies of 2019 considering that i didn't watch all of them. Also this is my first review on imdb"
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"After reading all the glowing reviews, especially about how this film is one of the best of the decade I had to see it for myself- the plot it self wasn't anything ground breaking, and while the technical aspect of the film were flawless and i enjoyed it for the first hour, the ending was a total let down (lots of plot holes that I won't get into here) I agree with some other reviewers, the Park family weren't your typical rich snobs, the father worked for his money and came home home and was always there for his children and polite to the domestics, the problem was the family was just too darn naive and foolish, but not terrible people by any means, all in all just a mixed bag, Shoplifters was a much more engaging and heart felt piece of foreign cinema, and I highly recommend watching that!!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"I've often thought that the genre mix of comedy - thriller is the most difficult to bring off. Somehow the two different kinds of reality, in their extremes, don't mix easily, unless the very nature of the narrative demands it, as in Dr Strangelove.  The comic first half is somewhat slow, and deals with the infiltration of a wealthy but naïve family, by a streetwise poor one. However, when the action develops along more serious lines in the second half, the atmosphere created in the first half still carries a surreal edge, and so I couldn't believe in the subsequent action sufficiently to be thrilled or horrified.  A brave attempt, but in the end I was left feeling a bit numb. It all seemed to lack any solid centre, with serious themes looking trivial, and comic themes looking disturbing rather than entertaining. All a bit tasteless, really."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"This sort of reminds me of a mix between comedy and drama. I understand that parts were meant to be funny and because of the difference in culture and sub titles, lots of the humor was lost on me but I could tell that some parts were meant to be funny. It was all very interesting and kept me wondering what was going to happen next. I thought this was a horror movie and it is not at all. More of a tradegy and social commentary. The smell didn't register with me either untill nearly the end but it was a great plot device."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Usually I dont comment/review the movies I am watching, but this one deserves it. Dont know what to say, just a MASTERPIECE.  Advice: Dont watch the trailer or try to get any information about the movie, just go out and watch it."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"Like the title, the film is catchy and dramatic to the end"
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"Nowadays, the horror movies seem to be just about blood, gores, and fear-inducing trite. Parasite is breaking the mold in this category as well as in the realm of Hollywood. The synopsis won't be needed as you need to see it for yourself, and for your own good. The fact that Hollywood has already adapted its plot and is currently in the works with the help of its director proves its ingenuity."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,It was between an 8 or 9 for me and the super originality and unique story was why I gave it a 9. The only con I had was it was a pretty creepy movie throughout and I had an ending playing out in my head that I thought was going to happen and thought it would be great. I was way off course. Which is also a great pro at the same time.
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"Recommendation for this great movie. Bitter comedy, which reflects today's society, through the prism of Korea."
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"There are lots of great movies out there. This is just not one of them. Why? Because it's predictable to a degree that I have seldom experienced. All major events can be predicted way ahead of them happening, which makes watching this movie into nothing but a waiting game. It's not deep and it's definitely not clever.  If the director should ever reveal that he made this movie as an experiment to explore how hollow of a movie you can get away with and still have the world hyped, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised."
기생충,Parasite,2019,2,,"Don't get the love people have for this movie. It starts as predictable slapstick comedy, then takes a sudden turn into a bloodsport parable on class warfare, and then then finishes -- can you guess? -- Nihilistic irony! Oh, that is really original, isn't it? All of the characters are unlikable, one-dimensional, amoral, lemmings. Apparently, Korean free enterprise economy makes them this way and their personal aspirations, ambitions, and accomplishments are simply results of circumstance and luck, as the wealthy and the poor are equally dimwitted, amoral, and self-interested."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"As a long-time fan of Bong and Song, I always knew this pair would make it at Cannes someday, and finally!!!! ^_^ (~Naneon Bong-iiyah~) I purposely never watched a single trailer of this in order to fully enjoy it and I'm glad it turned out Bong had made up for Ok-ja very successfully. Also, I'd like to add that Moongwang, the former housekeeper was ridiculously good. Despite all the laughs throughout the movie, it's quite bitter and sad and gets you thinking of the modern hierarchical, absurd society where we live in, all the way back home. I hope Bong's next movie would be just as good as Parasite."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"This film shows humanity in all its glory. We can try to claim the rich are evil and the poor deserve better but these are delusions we create to make us feel better. People are terrible. They are selfish. They are greedy. They are unkind. It's part of human nature. No matter how much you have, or how little, humanity still exists, and humanity is the problem.  All the problems in the world that make us suffer day to day are caused in the end because we are human. Nothing we can do about it.  The movie was good. Lol."
기생충,Parasite,2019,,,"Parasite is a unique movie. I don't know if it's a true masterpiece, or one of a kind (indeed), or just a piece of masterful craft. Bong does everything he wants while telling his stories, and he's the only one I know who can do that aside from Tarantino. The plus here is a very sound moral. I will think a lot about Parasite, and maybe watch it again. This is the first time in 100+ reviews that I don't feel I can correctly rate a movie, but surely it is in the 8 to 10 stars range."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Parasite, is Bong Joon-Ho at his best, I was at first sceptical when I was about to see this movie because of all the praise it had gotten, I was afraid that the expectations that were placed on it were too high and I would come out of the film disappointed. I couldn't have been more wrong, Parasite is fantastic, it nails a lot of technical aspects such as: Cinematography,editing and its production design which is right up there as some of the best production design this year. These technical aspects however are just complimenting the excellent writing by Bong Joon-Ho who manages to flawlessly ease us from one genre of film to the next. It covers comedy, drama, horror/thriller, and also manages to dive into social themes like class systems. The way it does all of this is so subtle, it doesn't go on a rant talking about the way people act when in different classes, it shows us, which I think is a lot more powerful. It doesn't villanize any one class, both the rich and poor people in this film have their good and bad moments making it feel even more authentic. The acting is also really strong I can't put my finger on one performance as it does feel like a strong ensemble effort.  On the negative end however, some of the actions made by a character near the end of the film (Specifically the birthday party sequence), I just didn't agree that this would be something the character would do, I still found the actions performed to be entertaining, I just think this character could have made a different decision and would have as well.  Overall, Parasite is a very well directed, written and acted film, which is enhanced even further by its excellent, cinematography, production design and editing. With great performances from an excellent ensemble, Parasite is one of the greatest foreign films ever made and well and truly deserves its Oscar praise."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,This is true masterpiece It's unpredictable i love this movie
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"Well what can I say, Boong Joon-Ho is truly delivering here a masterpiece of cinema screenwriting and directing. This is an interesting, humorous and intense experience surely not to miss.  You forget this is even a Korean film as you get vacuumed into a world of it's own - you won't be disappointed!!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"For me, Parasite is most convincing because of its confusing story, which is especially convincing because of its untypical pattern, so that it's hard to tell which genre you just saw. The script remains clumsy and at least gives me an oppressive feeling at the end. Moreover, the film is very nice to watch because of the staging and because of the convincing acting and set design you can put yourself in the movie's shoes and put yourself in the shoes of the characters, which are all put on with a lot of love."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"South Korean director Bong Joon-ho (""Okja"") says that he always tries to overturn viewer expectations and hopes that his latest film succeeds in this way. Palme d'Or winner at the 2019 Cannes Film festival, Bong's Parasite (Gisaengchung) does indeed thwart expectations, but the question is - to what end? Defying any strict genre classification, the film is a conglomeration of comedy, drama, satire, crime, horror, and anything else you can throw into the mix. Bong sees the film as a statement about the ""ranks and classes"" inherent in capitalism that are invisible to the eye, and says that the film ""depicts the inevitable cracks that appear when two classes brush up against each other in today's increasingly polarized society."" Unfortunately, the characterizations are filled with so many stereotypes that the lack of any realistic human dimension leaves Bong's statement without much impact.  The film looks at class differences between two families - one well-to-do, and the other n'eer do well. For the Kim family, life is a struggle. They live in a cramped bug-infested basement apartment without many amenities except for a toilet built on kind of a shelf. The father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho, ""Snowpiercer"") has failed in business and has accumulated many debts. His son and daughter Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik, ""Train to Busan"") and Ki-jung (Park So-dam, ""Cinderella and Four Knights"" TV series) have repeatedly failed college entrance exams. The mother Chung-sook (Hyae-jin Jang, ""Adulthood"") along with the two children fold boxes for a delivery company, but cannot even get that right. Not to worry, they leave their windows open when the fumigators come around to get some free extermination and steal free Wi-Fi from the next door coffee shop.  On the other hand, the nouveau riche Park family has all the advantages. Mr. Park (Lee Sun-kyun, ""Jo Pil-ho: The Dawning Rage"") is the CEO of a high-tech company and the family lives in a spacious, modernistic home protected by sturdy concrete walls. He has an attractive somewhat fragile wife Yeon-kyo (Jo Yeo-jeong, ""The Target""), a teenage daughter Da-hye (Jung Ji-so, ""The Tiger""), and a hyper-active young son Da-song (Jung Hyun-jun). Being wealthy and somewhat elitist in their attitude, for Bong, they are ideally suited to be torn apart by ruthless grifters. With the aid of a friend, Ki-woo is hired to be a private tutor for Da-hye. Of course, he has to forge university documents to convince the trusting Mrs. Park of his competence. With that conquest out of the way, the cunning Ki-woo concocts a scheme to secure jobs in the Park household for his entire family.  Convinced that their young son is a budding Picasso, Mrs. Park hires Ki-jung as an art teacher, then falls for invented stories impugning the character of their driver and housekeeper to provide some more employment opportunities for the Kims, this time for the deadbeat dad Ki-taek and his wife Chung-sook. Bong said that ""Sometimes with the characters in my films, I look at them cynically, but most of the time I have a lot of compassion for the characters, even with the villains."" This compassion, however, does not seem to extend to the loyal, hardworking household workers, their work scammed out of existence. Without going into detail, the whole escapade backfires in a twist that is over-the-top unsettling even though utterly implausible.  Worthy of a Mack Sennett comedy, a sweet family drama turns into a tumultuous melange of hidden chambers, revenge, bloody violence, a torrential rainstorm, people hiding under beds, and any other mayhem that may come to mind. To be clear, Parasite can be very funny and some of the satire is sharp-edged, yet it is hardly, as one critic described it, ""a masterful dissection of social inequality."" When asked what he wanted viewers to get out of the film, Bong said, ""I just hope that it gives audiences a lot to think about. It is in parts funny, frightening, and sad, and if it makes viewers feel like sharing a drink and talking over all the ideas they had while watching it, I'll wish for nothing more."" Enjoy the drink. In a little while, you may have trouble remembering what the film was about."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I know a lot of people have skipped this..... because nobody wants to read subtitles for 2 hours. I hope you are reading this.... And I hope that you can shake off your earlier reservations.... Please watch this.... Movies like this are very rarely made nowadays. Doesn't matter what genre a person likes.....this has it all.... Comedy, Love, Family, Thriller, Crime, Horror. What an awesome movie !!!!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,Movie is over rated. Its an average movie. Don't know why it created this much buzz.
기생충,Parasite,2019,5,,"I'm sorry but I must be living on another planet - I can't understand why this film won an oscar and why some are rating it a 10. I felt a little bored in parts and I felt uncomfortable. Reading some other reviews after the film, maybe there were some aspects I hadn't analysed and worked out intellectually. But then still I felt it was totally over hyped."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"The working class and down on their luck Kim family struggle to make ends meet. When a friend of the son, Ki-Woo's, who is an English tutor for the daughter in the wealthy Park family, has to leave his position, he recommends Ki-Woo for the job. Now having an ""in"" with the wealthy family, the Kims begin plotting the downfall of the current household servants and inserting themselves into those vacant positions, making them all gainfully employed and with money finally flowing into the household. But not everything is as it seems in the Park house or with their previous servants.  This movie starts out as a comedy and quickly goes into social commentary, pointing out the differences between the poor working class family and the wealthy privileged family. The differences are ones that get commonly pointed out with the well-to-do having what usually gets termed as first-world-problems, while the poor family is literally trying to survive and save meager possessions in a flood. It doesn't shy away or try to be subtle about it, but interestingly enough, we don't feel beaten over the head with it either, which is a major change from the ham-fisted approach taken by most filmmakers. Couching this in a comedy is a good approach, as well, as the audience's guard is let down and we become more receptive to the ideas.  However, I do say it's MOSTLY a comedy. The third act takes a dark, dark turn, and the contrast, not to mention general disdain and even indifference, between the classes becomes much more severe. This gets into some hard territory, and characters that we've found quirky and even come to like in some ways show very different sides of themselves. At the same time, it doesn't feel unexpected, almost like we could tell that this was under the surface all the time and tried to ignore it, but aren't surprised by it when it does show up. This is some masterful characterization!  Another aspect of note is that this film is rich in allegory and metaphor. It's a smart film, yet at the same time the filmmakers are not condescending about it. They give the audience credit for being able to understand the symbolism and don't spoon feed you everything, which is a refreshing change from the usual head-beating most filmmakers go for. At the same time, they understand that not every audience member will understand or immediately pick up on every symbol, but they have crafted this so carefully and so perfectly that you don't have to understand each and every one. That understanding merely enriches the experience, but isn't essential to it.  This film has gotten some recognition, and deservedly so. It is rich, intelligent, and polished to a degree that we sadly don't see as often as we should nowadays, showing the filmmakers are masters of their craft. This is easily one of the best films I've seen in 2019. Highly recommended!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I read a lot of rave reviews about this before I saw it. I also saw it on many ""must see"" lists the past month, so I thought, alright I'll watch it, and approached it with a ""show me what you got"" kind of attitude. It didn't take long before I realized that I was watching something incredibly different. In fact It is incomparable with anything I've ever seen before. It belongs and at the same time doesn't fit in in any kind of genre. It is as thrilling as the best parts of Gone Girl and is everything Jordan Peele's Us tried to be. I would say that this is the most divine work of cinema I've seen in many many years.  Some people refrain from watching foreign language films. I find myself paying more attention to the plot since I have to read what is being said. This is very beneficial to a film that demands your attention at every single moment, which this one does.  Parasite deserves a 10/10 because of the very simple reason that I wouldn't want to change a single second of it, everything had purpose. So watch it, I bet it will exceed any expectation you might have from reading all of these reviews."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Oh man so I love this movie. Beautifully shot and exquisitely acted. Parasite is funny, tugs at the heart strings and is super dark just like I like my films. The director Bong Joon-ho has delivered yet again. I'm in on everything thing else he makes. Go see this movie in the theaters while you can and if you miss it, definitely watch it when it's streaming you won't be disappointed. Parasite is a 10🙏🏻"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Parasite is a melody of fine cinema. It hits all the right notes that attracts its audiences with just the right amount of everything it has to offer. Each sequence delivers the perfect pacing relative to the ongoing conflict, accompanied by beautiful cinematography and scoring. The cast delivers an engaging performance that brings a sense of true harmony with each other. It also combines all forms of genre really well without it being cramped or overbearing. It excels in nearly all creative and technical aspects, but what truly captivates its viewers is its masterful storytelling. Overall, Bong Joon-ho has crafted a beautifully dark and chilling story that transcends language and connects with millions. The film deserves all the praise that it gets not only for its impeccable storytelling but also for setting a greater standard in the cinematic landscape."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"With Parasite, director Bong Joon-Ho creates an fantastic piece of cinema, that never lost my attention once. This movie makes your think it is going to be one thing and then it becomes something totally new. It's fresh, it's clever, it's shocking and it's satisfying. There is a scene in this movie that concludes the first act in a way that can only be compared to watching a Tetris game where every piece falls into its perfect place one after the other. Around the middle point something is revealed to the Audience that totally changes the path the movie was going on and from there it's an unrelenting roller coaster ride. Bong Joon-Ho also writes some fantastic characters, each of them getting their own perfect moments to shine. Not one character seemed out of place or without reason. They all had their place and brought different layers to the story through their actions and ideas. The actors of course help in bring this characters to life amazingly and the entire cast kills it to the maximum degree! Parasite is a film wonder and must be seen by all."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"Good movie, interesting story line, but never in a million years could win a oscar for best movie of the year...Political decision for sure! that's the world we live in unfortunately."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I will just say this first. If you are planning to watch this film, stop right here and watch it now before reading anything regarding this film because trust me you want to watch this without knowing anything not even the synonyms.  Now, directed by Joon-ho Bong who also directed Memories of Murder and Snowpiercer, Parasite is a dark comedy thriller which mixes various other genre. Its really hard to describe this film. I would compare this with Quentin Taratino films like the title suggests. But even then this film has a lot of direct message to audience and themes which is very easy to notice. That aside Joon-ho Bong has also upped his game in terms of the structure and storytelling. So much so that at first viewing you won't notice the hidden details and metaphors this film presents. The name ""parasite"" is just one of them. At the end you will be thinking who the real parasites are. Is it the rich, the poor, their expendable need for a better living or the house itself? Acting wise I dint see a single false note by any actors. The main standout was of course the father played brilliantly by Kang-ho Song. Writing is however what makes this film so great. You can see when the director wrote this film he thought of everything. There is not a single loop hole. Every character choices make sense, everything falls into place even when it seems to bizarre yet it seems so completely realistic just because just how we got to that point.  There is so much this film tries to say and you can see the director succeeded it gloriously when you think about it. The social structure with the way we live, our understanding and psychology at looking at people who live differently, our priorities and what we value. Joon-Ho Bong makes sure viewers will think after each act is completed and make your own judgement of what happened. He has completely turned a genre on its head. A film about social class has never been made like this before.  Still, this film may not please to people who just want a happy ending feel good movie. Without spoiling anything till now I will say that the first half is completely different to the second half. If you are the type of person who can handle violence and shock in a film then I will recommend this for you. If you are the person who want something different and original other than what hollywood keeps throwing these days I will recommend this for you. If you think film are not just for entertainment but for the art itself I will recommend this for you. Film industry need to keep investing on visionary directors like Bong Zoon-Ho and you might just get a masterpiece like this once in a while."
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"This movie for me is a solid 6. It's obstacles are from critics reviews putting it at a 10. Its not that good and cant live up to those expectations. If you watch it , you wont have wasted your time. If you don't watch it, you won't have missed much. Its average."
기생충,Parasite,2019,2,,Maybe people get too emotional in West. May be that is why it got an Oscar. There's nothing special about this movie; the story so average.
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I have seen two films previously from the director of this film, Bong Joon Ho. Those being Okja and The Host. I like them both quite a bit. I think however, that Parasite is the best film I have seen from him. Don't judge this movie on the US trailers, I felt they did a really bad job marketing the film, they made it look really pretentious. In reality, the actual movie isn't anything like that trailer. This is a dark, funny, insane, crazy, and thought provoking film.  I won't get too much into the plot as I feel it's something you should experience for yourself but the film centers around this poor family, the Kims, who try and take advantage of a rich family, the Parks. Things get complicated from there.  The acting in this movie is phenomenal, everyone here gives their A game. The directing by Bong Joon Ho is simply masterful. The screenplay is smart, creative, darkly funny like a Coen Bros movie (it reminded me a lot of Fargo especially), and is pure insanity at points. The film doesn't take sides on either family, they both do pretty bad things but at the same time, you surprisingly care about them, despite how flawed both of them are. The halfway point and the climax are some of the craziest moments I have seen all year. The movie also does a great job tackling the issues between classes in Korea.  The cinematography is beautiful, especially those big wide shots of environments. The editing is exquisite, no scene goes on for too long, they make every second of this film matter, and I never felt bored by the film, the 2 hour and 12 minute runtime flew by for me. The music is also pretty good as well.  Overall, Parasite is one film you absolutely must see this year. It has great performances, amazing direction, one of the best screenplays of the year, and it keeps you guessing what will happen next. Go into this movie as blind as you can, the less you know, the better."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Bong Joon-Ho is a filmmaker whose work I've admired since I saw Snowpiercer (2013). I've had my eyes on him ever since and I'll watch pretty much any film he directs. His newest film Parasite (2019) is not only the best film I've seen from him so far, but it might also be the best film I've seen so far this year. He may have crafted his own masterpiece. This film is sharp, it's tight, and hooks you till the very end. It's very fast paced, it's an extremely intense edge of your seat thriller, and its comedic at times which adds some levity to the film. The performances are all excellent across the board, the script, the dialogue, and the writing are all brilliant, and the score is very intense and enthralling. And to top it all off this film is shot very well, the cinematography and directing are great, and the shot composition is very interesting. And above all else this is just a very fast paced and interesting film that was incredibly fun to watch. I can't wait to see it again, I can't praise this film enough in words. See it as soon as you can, I highly recommend it, and it might be the best film I've seen so far this year!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"You will watch it and you know it has subtleties It talks about how poor and rich ""nice"" people see each other It doesn't bore you for a single minute It is the best this year"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I spent some time with the movie ""Parasite"" tonight. It captured me in it's symbiotic web. I'm sure there is not a single adjective that could describe it adequately...so I won't attempt that magficent accomplishment. Parasite tugged on every ounce of my acquired knowledge in philosophy, literature and Korean (yes...I do have a very tiny bit of that :) ) The set design was amazing...and it may give 1917 a run for it's money.  The stairs...oh so thoroughly magnificent in the simplicity yet the most complex of ""metaphors"" (yeah, I made myself giggle on that one.) I was instantly reminiscent of my Philosophy 101 ""Allegory of the Cave""....""I went down."" Thank you Herr Hanak.  Okay, I've lost all of you, I loved this movie for the Best Foreign Film...mostly because my theater neighbors tonight ate every kind of snack bar food possible...I will have nightmares about the gnawing, they chatted and checked their phones throughout...then they pottied and were able to read the screen....and then they seemed confused. Wonder why.  My feeling about awards..knowing the methodolgy of the voting....this film will not be best picture on Oscar night."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I'm just wowed by the film. It's an entertaining arthouse film that let audiences experience a variety of kinds of emotions during its screening. This satirical dark thriller talks about a sensitive issue about our society faced with inequality of wealth and class warfare through a poor family infiltrating into a rich household in the manner of what the audiences can easily get the point. Not only does this film provide you with such a poignant messages about the current times we live in but also it worths as a crowd-pleaser. Actually this film can't be referred as a specific genre in terms of its narrative and the plot that contain the elements of comedy, thriller and drama with the twists and turns. Bong again proves that he creates his own genre himself as just seen by many critics and cinephiles."
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"I don't really understand the high rate for the movie, it is very normal expected movie."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Yup. I've been Watching Bong-Joon-Ho's movie, And this is an end result. I won't say more. THIS IS A MASTERPIECE"
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"This film is either a love or hate review. I get that most that hate it maybe didn't understand the message - I did, but it was written in a mind-boggling illogical plot-hole ridden way. What makes it even worse, is how great it was from the start, that when the ridiculousness kicked in, you become extremely disappointed. There are so many ways this could've been written much better - and still get the message across, and maintain the initial theme without tanking. Directing and cinematography were excellent, and the casting on point. And the 132 min runtime was flying by, until the plot started to tank. Clearly over-hyped and not worth anything more than my 6/10"
기생충,Parasite,2019,4,,"After a first screening in a theatre, I couldn't understand the hype around PARASITE. So I watched it a second time at home and once again wasn't impressed at all. I suppose it's just not my kind of flick, and as I write this review a few months later, I realize that I don't remember much of it, even after seeing it twice. I have read all the praising comments with a 10/10 note, but couldn't find any of the qualities described, as if people commented another movie."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"You may not like everything you see, but you will be moved. I can't add much to the many excellent reviews here except to say that this is a film for true film lovers, not movie-goers. It's a film that makes you laugh, cry and most of all, think. Do not try to interpret the plot literally. The story is metaphoric. Zen, not Hollywood."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Great work! from start to end, it is wickedly funny and darkly disturbing all at the same time. The narrative and the actors were excellent. One of the better endings of a movie, The most original film and one of the 10 best films of 2019."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"A 2019 south korean film that shows the contrast between two families from different spectrums of the hierarchies/classes and the how individuals can turn into parasites, the film also blended both comedy and dark disturbing tones very well, while also delivering stunning vissuals of the use of camera work done masterfuly."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"At first sight I gave 10, but being close to the end of the movie I was thinking...""no, no 10, but 8"", because I doubted how they could miss what was with Moon-gwang, and then the story mentioned what was with her and I moved back to 10. :) The whole concept is great, from the story, music and photography to acting and style. Next to that is there are many genres in one. Also, in several moments it drives you to think about many things how would you react, gives mockery and shows the human nature, essentially."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,I heard nothing but great things about this film and upon watching it I had no idea what it was about or what to expected. I'm glad I watched it because it was like nothing I've ever seen before. I could definitely say it wouldn't be as impactful to me if it was American production with an all American cast. I would definitely recommend this watch!
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I expected a lot from Parasite (Gisaengchung) since it won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and because i really like Bong Joon-Ho's previous films.  Still, it exceeded my expectations. It's a comedy, Drama, Thriller and Horror film in one. Sometimes there are films which you know are going to be liked by people who are film enthusiast, but not by the general movie going public who go to the cinema to be entertained. I think Parasite is going to appeal to both film enthusiasts and the general movie going public.  The cinematography and mise-en-scene are beautiful as it often is in Korean films; the style is very similar to Burning by Lee Chang-Dong. But the story is something else. During the first part of the film it seems like a comedy and makes you laugh, but then after a while the story becomes more and more serious and eventually turns into a thriller/horror. I'm not going to say more about the plot/story than that because i don't want to give anything away and because i think you should go into this film without knowing anything.  This film is simply a must watch!! No wonder it won the Palme d'Or."
기생충,Parasite,2019,,,"In my latest IMDb review, I wrote the following;  ""1917 is British director Sam Mendes' latest opus. I also believe that it is the next Best Picture, and that he is worthy of his second Academy Award statuette for directing.""  Don't get me wrong, 1917 is a splendid and absorbing war movie. But after watching Parasite, I no longer agree with my earlier statements regarding Oscar statuettes ...  Parasite is perhaps one of the most unique films I have ever seen. One second, it is a hilarious comedy, and in the other, a terrifying horror flick. Suddently, it turns into a romance and then you find yourself watching a jaw-dropping thriller. The greatest thing about it, is that you don't even notice these dynamic changes in genre. The natural flow of the movie is just so beautiful.  I don't even know how Joon-ho was able to craft such a film as Parasite. No single shot is wasted, the intelligent script is baffling and sometimes the characters feel even more alive than real people.  Some complain over the fact that the film is in Korean, and that you end up reading the subtitles more than watching the actual movie. I find that statement to be nonsense. Maybe it is because I am quite used to reading subtitles that I find it to be so (I am from Sweden), but perhaps also because the acting is just so good that you know the feelings of each character just by looking at their facial expressions.  To conclude, I wish for Parasite to win five out of six possible nominations at the Academy Awards tonight;  Best picture: Sin-ae Kwak, Bong Joon Ho  Best Achievement in Directing: Bong Joon Ho  Best Original Screenplay: Bong Joon Ho, Jin Won Han  Best Achievement in Film Editing: Jinmo Yang  Best International Feature Film South Korea  I believe that Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood had better sets, but in all honesty, what is it compared to Parasite ?  I would not hesitate to put it in my top 10 best movies which I have ever seen. And, it is probably, the greatest movie of the 2010's. Read no further about it, just watch it. You will be delighted.  10/10"
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"I think there's a really good movie buried in ""Parasite"" somewhere, but I gave up trying to find it. It has the same problem the director's previous ""The Host"" had: the pacing is broken.  That's not all, though. People have written about the movie's unexpected twists and turns. The thing is, it keeps you waiting far too long for these to arrive, they are too few and far between, and too unbelievable. The first major twist happens about an hour in, and seems to come out of nowhere.  The parts of the movie detailing how this horrible family coordinates an incredible con on the rich Parks are the best bits, though they are far fetched: how can people with the ingenuity to do that be such losers beforehand?  But then that first twist hit and the movie lost me increasingly, until by the end I wasn't even paying attention.  Pity. Some of the sequences were brilliant."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"The suspense, drama, accuracy with the real life, visually amazing. It's just beautiful."
기생충,Parasite,2019,2,,"Ludicrous movie. I can't understand the reviews. This movie is full of insane people acting completely illogical. The poor are lazy and threacharous, while the rich are naive and simple. Don't believe the hype."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"After watching the most overrated korean movie ever ""the burning"", I almost lost the trust on imdb reviews but this movie put my trust back. It has everything, comedy , thrilling elements, suspense, emotional moments, satire and each and every actor played their role perfectly. It was treat to watch this movie. Highly recommended, just go for it."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,This movie lives in this time An amazing sweet thriller movie. Great in every single part of the seventh art especially in dialogues which are great no formality in them. Characters talk like ordinary people act like ordinary people they feel happiness they lose temper they succeed and they fail. And after all of these for converting a good movie to a great one you need to be in front of audience I mean the movie should conflict the audience mind and show them some facts. In this case facts are some of the most important ones in our modern life they are about class distinctions which is the difference between rich people and poor people that is getting larger every day and it is the greatest problem in my society finally when you finish watching this masterpiece ask yourself who is the real parasite? The poor family or the rich one which are sucking their stinky blood
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Parasite is a masterpiece and it is worth all the attention that it's getting. The script is very flawless and the cinematography captures the beauty of how the production designed each and every place. The actors executed their part very well and whenever they speak in English really entertains me and give the mood a comedic atmosphere. The whole film is very mesmerizing to watch and how you get to have a light comedy at the start that turned real dark by the end was a perfect blend on how to play the audience's emotions and get them fully engage in watching. I gave the film a 10/10 because the way they made the film was smooth, clean, and gorgeous in a way that you could get drowned in the details of every part of it."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"This movie is great it's hilarious, gripping and intense the less you know before seeing it the better"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,A movie that doesn't really belong to any genre. Still impresive story telling. One of the best of 2019
기생충,Parasite,2019,,,"Huge Oscar Winner?! What a JOKE!  There's no way or simply not enough to convince me that this 4-member family could have so easily conspired a big scam to wreck a rich family. The two screenplay writers, one of them was the director Bong, simply borrowed the mass majority feelings of the 99% struggling Koreans who deeply hate the upper 1% rich class people in Korea and made up a story that rendered a catharsis masturbation-like feel-good opportunity for the poor, a self-righteous, self-justified, self-indulgent revenge on the rich class.  At the beginning of this movie, this lowlife 4-member family was at bay and struggled to a barely survived condition, the husband/father was unemployed for a very long time, the wife was nothing but a mean heartless woman, the son and the daughter had failed the college entry exams for so many times. This helpless and hopeless family couldn't simply become a well practiced con-artist family overnight. If they were such great scammers, they would not have fallen so low and so helpless for such a long time. They were just like you and me who don't have money to afford a dignified basic living standard. They would not be possible to suddenly become expert con-artist so easy and so soon.  The most shameful scenario was the screenplay writers/director who made the rich people looked so stupid, naive, emotional fragile and so easily to be conned, they completely overlooked the fact why and how rich people became rich. The differences between the rich and the poor are many, but usually, it's because the rich people are smarter, more intelligent, more cunning, 1,000 times sharper than the poor, they are not so easy to be manipulated, conned, scammed, or swindled, otherwise they wouldn't become rich and successful. Yet this stereotyped shallow screenplay simply overlooked these facts and made the rich husband and wife so stupid and so easy to be manipulated by a bunch of losers who didn't even know how to make a basic living or how to pass the college exams.  The screenplay made the rich wife a fragile, naive, shallow emotional wreck, but totally refused to admit that rich wives usually are split-hair sharp, otherwise they'd not be able to handle their social status. The husband in this movie also showed that he's a hardworking super smart self-made businessman and entrepreneur, he should not be so easy to be manipulated by a bunch of losers. Yet this movie, again, simply overlooked the realistic fact and made these couple an easy moronic target by the scammers.  In summary: Zero Probability & Highly Unlikely! The long-term helpless 4-member losers were absolutely impossible to become a well-experienced, well-organized, smart grifters/swindlers. How possible these 4 lamers to could br so abruptly, so suddenly become so smart, so organized, so skillful overnight to carry out their scam step by step? It's against the basic logic and absolute impossible.  The director/screenplay writers just used the majority poor peoples' hate/resent/bitter feelings against the minority rich people psychology, manipulated the poor audiences to have a catharsis moment in the movie theaters. If the audience in Cannes Film Festival gave a 10-minutes standing ovation, it only showed the majority of the audiences were also the majority poor, they finally got the opportunity to have a small window to vent their bitterness against the rich, so they were so generous to award this one-way street movie the grand prize.  I don't know why the Korean movie makers are so obsessed in this kind of con-artist/imposter/swindler/fraud genre movies. Ah-ga-ssi (Handmaiden) (2016) is almost the same like this sucker, but that 2016 movie is even lower and abject than this one, but even that movie spent too much energy on the lesbian love-making scenes, these two movies are basically the same: HIGHLY UNLIKELY AND ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE! SAME CRAP, DIFFERENT TITLE. Only people without any logic thinking ability would enjoy them. To me, both of these two movies are just a torture to watch. There are many other Korean movies all like these two suckers, so I think it's time to call off making such stupid movies.  I'm a poor guy, yet I don't hate the rich people but envy them. I'm also a certified lifetime loser but I willingly admit that most of the rich people are definitely smarter than me, there's no way I could manipulate them and con even $0.01 out of their pocket."
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"The hype surrounding this film is too much, hearing people rave about it, calling it a masterpiece, movie of the year, even film of the decade. With all that praise, I expected it to be on par with films (in terms of storytelling, acting, script etc) like The Godfather, Pulp Fiction, The Shawshank Redemption or Park Chan-wook's Oldboy, but no, it didn't even came close. But still it was a very entertaining movie, people only overrate it."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,In starting 1 hours story is simple but then story make one after one thiller new type of suspance that's make this movie great . This movie can thinking everything many type of question & ending is super-level....
기생충,Parasite,2019,5,,"Overrated doesn't even begin to describe this film. I'm a fan of the director and am always excited when a new film of his is announced, and so it was with this film. Sadly, it does not deliver like his other works do. Performances are all uniformly excellent - particularly that of the poor family's father and the house maid of the rich family. Inventive camera work, a few chuckles here and there and a halfway point twist that makes you extremely uncomfortable and excited for where the story will go next and then...the story just takes a nose dive off of a cliff never to recover. As the film crawled towards its conclusion I couldn't wait to get out of the theater. By the time it's hoping to be ending arrives, I had already checked out. An interesting failure with a lot on its mind, but in the end, what's really underneath it all is a muddled point about class that isn't truly made. I would like for the film to have gone farther and darker than it did or to not have gone dark at all in the first place. This is a film that tries to be too many things at once and leaves you feeling cheated of seeing the movie you thought you were going to get. I keep thinking back to the one review blurb from the trailer (paraphrasing) ""a film that starts out as one thing and then becomes something entirely different"" - yeah, becomes a big stinker."
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"The film starts off as a Lucille Ball/Vivian Vance escapade and ends as Quentin Tarantino drama. I guess that's what we call fluidity. Parasite is terrific. The cast is embraceable. The actors were recognized by the Screen Actor's Guild for the ""Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture."" Hurray for Parasite."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"Epic tale of class distinctions in modern-day South Korea. Ironic, clever, and touching."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"I rated this a 7 yesterday but after a full day of thinking about it, I must say it's really good. Slow burn, it has everything in it. Unpredictable and makes you react outloud"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Delightful from beginning to end, opening is way in between genres, loved the pace, the comedy, the ending, the twist, the characters, pretty much everything.  I'm just waiting to rewatch it and pick new details.  if you do (watch it) please do it in the cinema and maybe you will get a crowd like mine that bonded trough the laughs and the shock and ended up talking about it outside.  And If you end up thinking is overrated it's okey, but you will still end up thinking about it for days."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,Apart from the great cinematography what overwhelmed me about this movie is its screenplay. The movie follows a continuity of speed and all the way keeps the humour intact. The dark satirical comedy which is funny but after every laugh it also pins a thought about the actual darkness which creates the humour and it lingers for sometime. A movie for all genre lovers.
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"Hilarious at times, weird, with some unexpected plot twists. Shows that whether you are rich or poor, the life you lead is really is just as futile........update: Yessss I am so happy that it has now won an oscar for best movie ! Well deserved!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,,,"Without my habbit watching all Korean movies an airline has to offer on bord entertainment I'd probably never heard of this movie, depending how deep its run in award season gonna be and I hope it goes deep.  The movie is captivating from the first second and shows quite quickly which morbid rabbit hole it's gonna go down and depending on your own character you like it at that point or you start hating like the 1% here on imdb...  everything else already got written, not getting the Academy Award for Best Foreign Movie will be the biggest snub ever. Period."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"""Parasite"" Review (10/10)  Snowpiercer director Bong Joon-ho has made a South Korean social satire that's also a genre-bending Palme d'Or-winning thriller of class struggle. It's best to go into ""Parasite,"" the Cannes Film Festival grand-prize winner by Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho, not knowing too much about what you're about to see; the better to let its sly power sneak up on you. A dark satire of the class divide in contemporary South Korea, it's the story of two families of four. You'll watch knowing you're in the hands of a master filmmaker; only wondering when it's over how certain effects were achieved (a sequence near the end is a wonder), and losing yourself in these characters: particularly the gentle, wide-eyed anxiety of Mrs. Park and the way that Ki-woo's father, a man who cheerfully recites his string of failed businesses, remains determined to somehow find a way to make his family prosperous again. The title metaphor becomes abundantly clear, is filled with vivid conversations that remind us how the Parks can't imagine (or don't care to imagine) how the other half lives. In one scene, they coolly discuss how poor people smell; like an old radish, says Mr. Park, or a rag that's been boiled. Ki-woo's family, however, seems to understand the rich all too well. What keeps you rapt in Parasite is the visual wit, every shot distills the movie's themes, and the richness of the characters and performances: Song's stricken expression as Kim Sr. is driven to murder by class resentment, Lee Jeong-eun's swift transformation from a calmly efficient housekeeper to a keening madwoman, and Choi's eloquent helplessness as his teenage protagonist watches this new world order gorily combust. At the heart of Parasite is the most gnawing evolutionary fear of all, the inability to protect one's family. Parents work to save their children but lose them, as children lose their parents and wives their husbands. The bonds are firm but can withstand only so much pressure before they fracture. Who are the real parasites? The poor who attach themselves to the rich or the rich who suck the marrow of the poor? The movie dissects the universal gap between the haves and the have-nots with shocking wit, stinging topicality and gut-wrenching violence. It's explosive filmmaking on every level."
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,It was OK. Not sure what's the fuzz around it tho. Slow paced drama/triller with very little plot and excitment. Felt pretty boring most of the time.
기생충,Parasite,2019,3,,"After watching the movie I checked IMDB score.  There should be some kind of Korean Film Maffia or IMDB Trolls who voted with high score.  A complete nonsense.  After a hour, you start to look at the screen and say ""WHY?"".  All nonsense movies gets some award from the festival juries. I think they may wanna show off something like ""we understood the sarcasm but you don't""."
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,I don't watch many non-english language films but I think Parasite is worthy of worldwide recognition for being an exceptional film. Although I don't see it as a masterpiece I think there are a lot of high-level elements of filmmaking in this. The plot seems simple enough but there is a lot of depth in the writing and storytelling to warrant multiple viewings. The acting is great as well as the direction but I'm always feeling like I'm missing the full experience when subtitles don't convey the subtleties of the language and cultural references. But that just goes with the territory if you happen to be from a foreign country. 8/10
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"This film contains everything you want in a movie. Characters who are complex - not all good or all bad, interesting homes, humor, suspense, surprise, sex and depth. I was on the edge of my seat for much of the movie. It's the best movie I've seen all year."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Oh my goodness. This is one of the best films I've seen in a while. If you choose to see this film, I plead for you to go in blind. That's the best way to view it.  I'm trying to not say anything about it here. If one person sees this review and decides not to look anything up before watching, then I'll have succeeded."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Wow, what a story. Real relloercoaster, you get all emotions in this movie. Korean cinematography is best by far. Hollywood needs to learn from them!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,,,"Parasite? Brilliant. You heard it here first. It's like four terrific films put into one and somehow effortlessly so. It always subverted my expectations and was a very special experience. Everyone in the theater was completely hooked by it. Laughter, screams, gasps... How many films can do that? On top of that I'm sure I'll even get more out of it on rewatches."
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"The only reason this movie got the fame and awards it got is because it is a korean movie. And let me be clear here, not just specifically korean but literally any non-US movie on par with Parasite in terms of quality would have been as successful as Parasite anyway; with a bit of luck of course. Actually not just a bit of luck; they would need all the stars in universe to align as well because that's what happened with Parasite. It is nothing but an average movie that only got this boosted because some people decided to take a look outside the rock they have been living under for over decades and they saw this average movie and thought ""That's a lot better than what I expected!"". Domino effect followed and today, we got this movie that's overrated and predictable. No different than your average ""ThRiLLeR"" movie.  P. S.: The only reason I went this hard on the movie is because the internet went so good on it and the movie got more than it deserved anyway so keep calm, the movie is still watchable; when drunk."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I absolutely loved this film. I thought it was sad, darkly funny, discomfiting, and absolutely brilliant. It's hard to talk about the script and its astute observations about class and equality without giving too much away, but oh my, so many stairways so leaden with meaning. If you aren't into foreign movies because of the subtitles, I'd still highly recommend seeing this. He is such a master of image and setting that it conveys as much as the dialogue. I've got ""Snowpiercer"" lined up to watch tomorrow for a full-on Bong Joon-ho weekend."
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"I won't go into the details of the plot which can be read elsewhere but simply give me impressions. Well directed, interesting story (even if there were some clunky moments), good acting, good dialogue but way too long.  People are raving about PARASITE. I'm not one of them. Masterpiece? Hardly. All the characters are supremely unlikable. Perhaps that was intentional. Ironically, the rich family provoked more sympathy which I doubt WAS intentional. I racked my brain wondering why people are so enthralled by this movie. Do you suppose bc it has a sub text? I mean, of course it has a sub text. it is a satire on the relationship btn the rich and poor in Korea. But that is plainly obvious. It's not subtle. Actually it's not even a sub text, it IS the text. But up against Hollywood cinema which rarely has ANY sub text and usually just presents us with a story on the screen writ large PARASITE then is seen as sophisticated.  I didn't rate PARASITE very highly. That's my loss I guess."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"This year the Academy Awards have gone even more nonsensical than usual. Not only did they unjusitfiably snub many deserving people and movies, but over-ladened a few films with much more recognition than they deserve.  Once Upon A Time in Hollywood - 10 Oscar noms. (why?) Joker - 11 Oscar noms. (why?)  Parasite? 6. (all deserved).  Basically, the Oscars are more of a joke with each passing year. However in saying that, at least they gave 6 nominations to Parasite, which in my opinion is the clear frontrunner for Best Film.  It's the most interesting and engaging movie of the year, and the most successful Korean movie in history, both in Korea and around the world. I highly recommend it."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"This was one of the most entertaining and enthralling movies I'd seen all year. Everything, from the pacing, filming, characters, story, and dialogue all converge upon the viewer's brain, exciting them neurons like fireworks, bathing our cortices with explosive brain juice! Every scene has a purpose, and builds upon the story, leading up to its climatic ending."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"This film goes places where few dare to wonder. It begins as a dark, hilarious comedy but evolves into a startling, violent climex I will never forget. Everything about the film is exceptional. It is a true masterpiece."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"From the beautiful cinematography, blocking, locations to the fantastic acting and screen play it is a must watch movie. This truly original story was a once in a lifetime journey that had me laughing, crying and frighten all in one sitting. Don't take my word for it see it for yourself!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Rather than review, I like to add two cents to the conversations.  One individual comments that she never rides the subway. What is the significance of the below ground/above the surface boundary? Which domain affords the better social perspective?  And is anyone in this story not parasitic? Hardly anyone that I can identify."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"There I said it---It's the best film of the year for this reviewer, and it's the best film Bong Jong-ho has made to date.  But to be fair, I've yet to see ""The Irishman,"" ""1917,"" and ""A Hidden Life,"" so my opinion could change. Though, I can't see that being likely.  The originalness of ""Parasite"" is what sets it apart. ""Parasite,"" twists and turns to darker and darker places while still maintaining a comedic tone. There's ingenious visual cinematography and storytelling when it portrays the division of class between the wealthy and poor.  Class inequality is a theme director Bong Joon-ho frequently uses. You observe it in his other films, ""Snowpiercer,"" ""Okja,"" and even in the first film I ever saw of his back in 2006 with Joon-ho's horror film, ""The Host."" Which also starred Kang-ho Song who plays, Kevin's father in ""Parasite."" He's hilariously witty in both films.  ""Parasite"" set in South Korea, is about a young man from an impoverished family, the Kims, who winds up with a job to tutor a high school girl from an extremely affluent family, the Parks. He changes his name from Kim Ki-woo to Kevin to impersonate an English tutor. He soon realizes this could be a way to get his whole family employment under the Parks, and the family makes it their plan to do-so.  The film shined when it cinematically showed the differences between class equality among these two very different families. When we see the wealthy Park family, the house is pristinely clean. A complete contrast to the Kim family apartment, which is a basement apartment littered with trash and infested by stink bugs, in what looks to be one of the poorest sections of the city.  If you like dark comedies, then you're sure to enjoy ""Parasite."" I've witnessed people who don't like foreign films because of subtitle-hatred still relish this film.  You won't see another movie like ""Parasite,"" perhaps ever. Well done, Bong Joon-ho."
기생충,Parasite,2019,,,"Wow. What a film. The experience of watching it is surely one to behold and one to remember. What is especially striking about the whole thing is just how well-constructed it is. A film like this, trying to do this much both narratively and thematically, could have easily fallen apart in the hands of most directors. Bong Joon-Ho is incredibly skilled in how he handles this script and his fantastic directing. Really amazing piece of work that I hope gets a ton of accolades."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,Beautiful movie congratulations. story beautiful movie
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,I find the film's visual symphonic. The use of montage in such a way that creates a flow of revelations. Camera movements are buttery smooth and well executed. The concept of the film which is about the social classes has paid such an impact to the audience. Bong joon-ho used such a technique in which he showed us the things that we may not be aware of. The film did a great job on putting its audience on a thrilling rollercoaster ride of emotions.
기생충,Parasite,2019,5,,"A story there was. Thrilling scenes there were. Some pretty cinematography yes. Solid character build-up, hell no. Logical plot, no. Entertainment, not much. Consistency of characters, missing. Petty resentful ignorance towards the rich, yes. Narrow and shallow depiction of the poor, very much.  So not convincing. Every stretch of the movie i thought I started understanding the characters a bit more, but no, next stretch would make me scratch that understanding and try to rebuild again.. In the end, it made me fail to attach with any of the characters.  Without enough entertainment, what were the film makers trying to tell the audience? I completely don't get it.  Really doesn't match the hype. Wasted two hours of my life."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,Quick. Metaphorical. Social. Postmodern. Beautiful.  You miss if you don't watch it.
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"Watching a movie in another language sometimes creates a barrier, but great film making and writing can instead, turn that into a bridge, and such is one of Parasite's strengths. I never felt out of touch with what was going on because I didn't understand that culture or anything along those lines, and that's why I highly recommend this movie to anyone. Parasite also has many outstanding shots and high level filmmaking in general. Visuals never dissapoint. The movie is so well paced and gets pretty wild toward the end without being ridiculous. The twists and turns it made were one of the most entertaining Ive seen in a while. There isn't much else to disect. Just go watch it."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"My first ever Korean film and the film lives to its expectation after seeing the movie trailer. It was mixed of comedy, suspense and even horror, go see it you'll be suprised!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I didn't think I could have my expectations exceeded for this movie, but WOW! Bong Joon Ho really floored me with this one, I tell you what!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"This is undoubtedly one of the best movies of the year and I think the best work of Bong Joon Ho yet. It's a very funny and playful movie. You can't pin it down into one specific genre, much like Bong Joon Ho's other work. Some moments are absurdly funny while others are intense. The premise is about a poor family who lives in a small basement apartment and struggling in their everyday life. One day one of their family members gets a chance to work as an English tutor for the daughter of a wealthy family. The poor family sees this as an opportunity to scam this wealthy family and they find a way to all work for them. Things get more serious after the first half because some stuff happens and the poor family has to deal with it cautiously. What is amazing about this movie is the story is simple and realistic, but told in such a fresh and unique way that it feels relatable and larger than life. The director shows the irony of life. How two separate classes of people in a society perceive things differently. While watching the movie, it was so engaging that I felt like it was controlling me with its beautiful cinematography and well structured plot."
기생충,Parasite,2019,,,"My rating: A-plus. (Just like what others have already stated in this comment section: BEST WATCHED WHEN ONE DOESN'T HAVE MUCH PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF THIS FILM:)  Starts with an unemployed Ki-woo who was asked to replace his college student friend in being a rich girl's English tutor even though he hasn't got qualifications apart from having been a repeat-taker of university entrance exams...  This one ends up becoming a thorough scrutiny of the gluttonous side of human nature which is always a welcome and an essential ingredient in any bitter satire that's in the same vein as one of those Coen Brothers' films. And this one needs to feed off the audience's unabashed derisive laughter for it to deemed a worthy yang to the yin of that J-P Jeunet classic Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain or even to a lesser extent C Nolan's Inception. Whereas the wistful rom-com and the meta sci-fi have its darker elements in the narrative neatly tucked away in its recesses, the Palme d'Or recipient does the exact opposite. Such dualism that occurs in the cinematic world is much needed which serves to cleanse each other's cinematic excesses. And it took a long time for a film like this Korean one to come by and serve as a worthy film to counterbalance the sentimentalism which can only be considered to be a magnet very much ripe for any Cy-Bugs to devour wantonly in such an orgiastic frenzy.  But the film itself can be considered as sharing the same kindredship and is way aligned more to the thematic and aesthetic sensibilities of Yorgos Lanthimos' ones (Dogtooth, The Lobster, or even the Favourite), if not quite to be considered as it's ugly, distant cocaine-junkie cousin, shares the same filmic DNA sure, though fun at parties but can be a bit of a deadweight accomplice. Whereas Boon-J-H's film is more rooted in emotional judgments that each of the characters made that has quite sensible outcomes, Lanthimos' looks like the logic that pervades throughout have just been delivered via a spaceship that endured light-years' distance flight.  Kudos to the brilliant actors and the technical crew that delivered polished work, all had their share in driving the narrative the writer/director put forth for it to become a resounding triumph. Made me laugh so hard I feel the need to re-watch it again soon. Not to give much away of the story, I will only mention one that's among my favorite scenes, that of one character's delicious rant mimicking North Korean newscasts delivered with much hysterical gusto. I can't help but fall out of my chair on that one. It is such an impressive, inspired work of an ensemble that might just beg for an American language remake because the immediacy of the issues explored might be considered to be a meaty enough for the Hollywood actors to consider sinking their teeth into, that is if the richness of the allusions that are very particular to the Korean identity and consciousness does not work against that thought."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"The film is a contemporary cinamatic adaptation of the Sisyphus myth. You will even find the stone, symbolically appearing at many scenes."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"This movie delivers everything you can expect after watching the trailer. It's an enterntaining dark comedy that has some ""drama"" and even has some tense, thrillerish moments. It won't dissapoint you, but it's not the best movie of the year, nor the best korean movie ever made. It's not even that weird or unpredictable. It's just a good movie, not an otherwordly experience. But it won't dissapoint you, you should definitely watch it."
기생충,Parasite,2019,4,,"In my opinion this movie is overrated. Because of the rating i watched this movie but there is not good as rating. One i like from this movie is description between rich and poor. I like this part a lot, that's why this movie got an oscar. But overall is not good as rating."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"Bong Joon-ho's Parasite is perfectly written, filmed, and played - a bit too much at times (did we need this Ri Chun-hee's impersonation, or was that a bonus for Western audiences?).  No spoilers, but you're forced to understand the gimchi will somehow hit the fan, to want to know, among all possible worst case scenarios, which one will prevail, and to enjoy the ever darker humor first permeating, then overflowing this over the top gem.  If this brilliant epic echoes Im Sang-soo's 'The Housemaid' & Kim Ki-duk's '3 iron', Bong remains a league of his own."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"A question in my mind after watching this movie is if I'm one of these roles and what will I do?  ""Parasite"" presents the situation that the worst outcome might happened when the different social classes meet. The depiction of bottom-class people in this film are both sympathized but greedy. Although rich people are kind, they just can't stand the smell and life quality from bottom-class people, and they express their emotion too obviously to bottom-class people. This is humanity, and there is no correct answer, but we can think deeply in this issue. And what if you are neither parasite nor host, would you try to narrow the wealth gap or just be a bystander and do nothing?  It's very meaningful that most people give more concerns and think about each other after seeing this film."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"One thing I always want from a movie is great start and building characters with fun this movie perfectly delivers that while watching you feel like ""yes those peoples are really poor look how they are chasing for a free wifi signal. Movie is fast paced and I quite liked the ending. Surely one of the best movie of this decade"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"This is one of the greatest thing ever produced for a long time and most importantly ,Fresh. Unpredictable,mysterious and comedic so many feelings at the same time. Just watch and experience yourself if haven't already."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"One of the best movies of all time I would say, it's genre bending ranging from funny, suspenseful, thrilling to emotional."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Such a masterpiece that saved us from a big disappointment of 2019 movies, parasite is definitely the best of the year"
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"When Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo Shik) is indicated by his best friend, who will travel, as the replacement English tutor of a teenage daughter of the wealthy Park family, he is immediately hired. Soon he foresees the chance to bring his poor unambitious family to work for the family. The Kim family plots a scheme to fire the Park´s driver and the housekeeper and soon his father is hired as driver, his mother as housekeeper and his sister as arts teacher of the wealthy family. When the Park Family travels for camping, they stay in their house as if they were the owners. But soon something happens that will affect the Kim and Park families.  ""Gisaengchung"", a.k.a. ""Parasite"", is an original, unconventional and overrated black comedy by the South Korean Bong Joon Ho. The film is good and the plot is funny, dramatic and suspenseful but there is no motive for the hype around this movie. My vote is seven.  Title (Brazil): ""Parasita"" (""Parasite"")"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Best film I've seen in a long while, great plot good twist highly recommended"
기생충,Parasite,2019,4,,"We live in a time where liking the eccentricities born from different cultures with a sprinkling of foreign language makes something supposedly good.  However, the moral from Hans Christian Andersen's story 'The Emperors New Clothes', is: telling ourselves something is 'good' doesn't mean it is; and, that is very much the case for Parasite.  In the main, the film isn't too bad. A poor family move in on a wealthy family and it eventually leads to tragedy. The acting is only 'alright' but certainly not fantastic as many reviewers say, and the viewer doesn't learn much about the wealthy family. The film also leaves many unanswered questions, such as: It's all a little silly really  The film will appeal to: 1. Wave the flag of support for anything foreign 2. Think being 'politically correct' is a political party 3. Think transgender-ism is choice not a biological state  If you haven't seen this, you're not missing much."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Went in with little knowledge about this movie. This movie was hilarious, suspenseful, and horrifying. I left the theater with a huge smile on my face. Even if you don't watch foreign films, this should be your exception, because this film is something special."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"A must see if you are tired of endless Hollywood sequels and super hero movies. A can't miss if you are into Quentin Tarantino type of movies (although, without a heroic central character). This is a very entertaining story that's beautifully shot and told with many twist and turns, at a nice and tight pace, from start to finish."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"This movie is just smart, entertaining, and artistically fulfilling. If it had only succeeded in one of those three aspects, this would be a very good movie, but instead it just excels at all three.  The script is more than satisfying and highly entertaining. And the way the movie presents its own world and draws you in completely... it is just beautiful.  It is difficult to judge the acting when you don't speak the language, but all interactions look very convincing and in line with the implausibility of this so ridiculous world, yet so similar to ours.  I just wanted to write this review to recommend anyone who's reading to watch this movie. I really enjoyed it and, I will gladly watch it again some time in the future."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Never Expected this kind of Movie...This movie literally contains all elements.... Brilliant Direction,Music,and acting....Must watch movie"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I might say the titel and the cover seems a bit decieving, it looks more like something for a horror movie but it totally isn't a horror movie. This film just keeps you wondering what will happen and shows a great contrast between the poor and rich. However wrong the path that main character chose, it was really creative. The plot twist were also very well done and how every part of the movie seemed to fit with each other."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"As I write this, I want to describe my raw initial state after I finished the film, I'm in a state of complete awe, staring into the wall kind of awe, Parasite is truly a work of art, a sheer masterpiece. This film oozes with mastery, every little detail tells a story of its own, I was drawn to it like a moth to a flame, it grips hard and it never lets go, it sways between genres gracefully, it offers comedy both dark and light, drama, horror, thrill, and it's all packaged so seamlessly, conveyed to us throughout breathtaking performances across the board, I've watched my share of Korean Cinema to know that's a common thing but Parasite takes it to a whole other level, it materializes thoughts and ideas, things words can not communicate, it is extremely rare to experience such a thing in film, I can only name a small number of movies that actually made me feel this way, just incredible. Director Bong Joon Ho proves that he is a master within his own cross-genre domain, he takes charge and you actually feel like you're in safe hands watching this, he shapes the scenes perfectly, A true master of his trade, Thank You. In all honesty, I feel like I went through an experiment where the time went still and I experienced a piece of art such as this, I absloutely, wholeheartedly loved every single second of this film, MINDBLOWING."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"This is the best Korean film of all time. Now that is not really saying much, as Korean films generally finish fourth in a competition with Chinese, Japanese and Indian films in Asia. But if this film is any indication, Korea may be on the cusp of jumping over one of their competitors in Asia. This black comedy has the feel of Coen Brothers special, though not quite as pithy or broad. There is more character development here than in most Coen films (with the exception of Fargo). Joon-Ho does a great job of writing and directing and brings his vision home to roost without any apparent flaws. Each actor in the film does a very nice job, with the daughter of the hustler family (I love good hustler films) doing an outstanding turn. I look forward to Joon-Ho's next project."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Such a precise way of unfolding a story, every frame is captivating. Tells the story of social divide in a truly masterful metaphorical thriller with such craft that you can't take your eyes off any single character. Altogether a hitchcokian tale that keeps surprising you with every scene until it's inevitable and explosive third act. I'm in awe of this film."
기생충,Parasite,2019,,,"This movie is rotten garbage. Main characters are unlikeable. The story as it plays out, predictably, is tedious. The characters lives are not interesting to watch. 36 minutes in I wondered if something interesting was going to happen. The movie is not funny and for sure not a thriller. The ending was ridiculous. I wasted my time watching this."
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"Maybe I'm dumb. But given that this movies on paper is a masterpiece to me (I'm a big fan of Memories of Murder and Chaser ) but as execution, I feel like I'm fed a messege. And that broke the fourth wall for me.  The first half is masterfully plotted and acted and directed. It could have just stuck to this story and the eventual clash with the rich family. But the plot in the basement and the overall comic tone in the second half, it lost me.  It lost me even more that it's hailed as a masterpiece for Oscar. It's plain to see that Oscars have a political or some kind of Agenda. I mean over the years there has been foreign masterpieces that no one even considered in Oscars."
기생충,Parasite,2019,4,,"Should have known when it got the academy award for best picture it would be disappointing. I really enjoyed Bong Joon-ho's Memories of a Murder and Mother. Unfortunately in this movie there was no character development and the characters were just stereotyped cliches. The less fortunate family was just a pack of sociopathic dirt bags and the well off family was laughable with its disinterested father, pretentious and anxious mother, the spoiled son who runs riot pretending to be a Native American as he preys on the house maid with his bow and arrow set, and finally the moody, withdrawn awkward daughter. The only character with any spark is the previous housemaid. The story plods along in predictable fashion with an ending without redemption or closure for any of these pathetic souls. For an academy award winner there were so many silly and unbelievable scenes where things magically disappeared from one scene to the next. Most notably, how the hell did the son in the less fortunate family get that rock back after his misfortune? See the movie and you'll see how ridiculous that is. The Morse code nonsense was tied together poorly and with little purpose. Movie ran out of steam at the end with nothing happening to leave the audience satisfied or even thinking about what just happened."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Great acting, wonderfully written screenplay, artist style and cinematography. Too much to talk about, just WATCH this movie."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Last night was one of the most thrilling experiences I have had watching a film..  I attended a small arthouse theatre close to 15 minutes from my house. I finally saw a movie I had been yearning for some time. I am a little late to the party, in regards to my timing of this film. But I am ecstatic I got to view it in a theatre. I wanted to go in with no expectations, because typically I am let down. I have a tendency nitpick as a viewer, which can make some movies difficult to enjoy. I was aware that it had won best foreign film at the Golden Globes, and had received much critical acclaim. I cannot recall seeing another Bong Joon Ho film, except possibly The Host (in which case, it was so long ago- I do not remember). Either way, I was excited to see a movie that looked like a family drama, with perhaps some suspenseful elements.  As I sat in this small cleanly theatre, I noticed the majority of people were of Asian descent, and unless my eyes betrayed me, mostly Korean. I attend movies frequently and it was nice to see a very diverse crowd. As the lights dimmed and people munched on their popcorn, and drank their coke's; I sat there, by myself- as the only one in my row. Ready to have a fun experience, with what's been regarded as one of the best of the year.  The first portion of the movie, centers around an engaging Korean family who live in a lower-class part of the city looking for jobs. They live in a home that is underground, but can still see the street through one of the windows. The family consists of a young adolescent brother and sister as well as their middle-aged parents. The movie begins with raucous laughs and instantly makes you engaged with these characters. The first 30 mins is truly a full-blown comedy and my theatre could not stop laughing. In its own right it is a very effective comedy, that had hints of possible dread ahead. The hints at suspense begin when another family is brought into the story. We see how both of these families become entangled in each other's lives, and how the threads are tied together. The pace was slower in the early stages, but still immensely entertaining. Then there is a tonal flip. A character re-enters the story and you instantly feel tight. At this point you could not really tell where the story was headed, so I stayed in peak curiosity. Then comes a moment when dread absolutely swept over me and I felt as if the story was about to turn into a full-blown horror movie. I sat there in near dread, caught in my own amazement of what I was watching. The tension then softened a bit, but there was still an underlay of tightness. The whole tone of the movie had changed by this point, and you can feel the stress the characters are going through. As well as the fact that the viewer knows more than some of the characters on screen, so there are moments when you want to shout at the screen- DON'T LOOK THERE! Within a few minutes though, you are immersed in the new direction the story has gone in and what's happening. It was fun to follow the story's new direction, with a good level of suspense at this point. You can feel everything is on the brink of destruction, but its still being held together by a thread. Then the story levels off a little bit, heading an even different direction. In this sequence the story is setting up a finale, that will leave devastation. Once we get started in the third act, my jaw just about hit the floor and I was stunned. The final 20 minutes of this people was honestly breathtaking. The music, visuals, acting and the tone of the story hits you like a ton of bricks. By the time the final credits rolled, I sat there in utter amazement. It was the first time I left a theatre feeling utter euphoria. I was absolutely ecstatic with what I had just seen.  Parasite is a film that brings together a plethora of genres that all coalesce effectively. There is an underlying theme of classism and how the social construct of class impacts the psyche of the characters. But this is truly a story that has many layers, and the shifting tones create an atmosphere that is both eerily terrifying as well as holistically captivating.  Grade- A+  Brody's TAKE 5"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"One of the best film in foreign language !!! Actually it's not a film, It's our real life story... I have nothing more to say about this great creation....."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"The best film of the year, maybe the best film of the decade. Just one of the best films in general. Joon-ho Bong balances a social thriller, satire and drama, perfectly and effortlessly. The cinematography is as good as I've ever seen in a film; the editing keeps it highly engaging; the production design adds the impactful disparity between the classes; the score and sound design adds significant character and emotion to each scene; and the performances are powerfully executed from the whole cast. Parasite deserves all the high praise it is receiving from critics and somehow, it deserves more."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"One of the best films of the decade. It has it all: amazing cast, great music, cinematography, genius writing and direction. And most important, it's thought provoking. A philosophical piece about where moral stands in life of survival, about the ascend to happiness and the descend that reminds you money isn't everything. The characters so complex yet so simple and delivered with brilliant acting. Bong joon-ho has proven to be one of the best filmmakers working today."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,Best movie of the year full of suspense and white knuckle moments is the hype. Not the reality. A unique story that misses a lot of opportunities in it's execution. A highly unsatisfying ending. Lots of loose ends. Didn't live up to the hype at all. An enjoyable watch but less suspenseful as The Hand That Rocks the Cradle.
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Ranks as one of the best films I have ever seen and I've seen many .  Very clever , unusual story it's about as original as a film can be , it totally lacked the predictability of most US films.  Don't miss it"
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,The movie is not what I expected. And not as brilliant as it was being told. I chhod have easily skipped this without regret.
기생충,Parasite,2019,1,,"This movie is trying to say that capitalism is causing both the rich and poor to become parasites - the poor are scam artists lying for money, and the rich are using the poor to nurture their kids. But it's a mess of a story, not a ""masterpiece."" In the real world, the poor definitely have to fight major barriers to get ahead, but this movie doesn't have any depth - the symbolism is amateurish, the characters are one dimensional and inconsistent, and the dialogue between rich and poor is totally unrealistic. The movie makes it seem like the poor are all scamming, bumbling psychopaths, and the rich are all naive and emotionally clueless. Sorry, it's an ignorant view of the world. It makes me realize how disconnected from reality the entertainment industry and its official reviewers have become. Or maybe Hollywood is trying to gain more money and audience share in overseas markets so they promoted this one."
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"Great! Awesome! Very interesting plot! I think it is one of the best thriller of 2019! I'm not a fan of Korean films, but this is great movie! I hope it win one or few Oscars!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Nothing comes close. In terms of direction, writing and performances."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,I saw this movie a couple of weeks ago and it's sticking with me.  I can't give a solid review yet because I'm still processing everything. Not so much processing but there are so many layers to this movie from rich to poor to cons to subtleties that the average movie-goers might miss.  This is a must see and I truly hope it wins Best Foreign Film this year if not Best Picture.  What a film.
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"PARASITE Directed by Bong Joon-Ho How often does one get the opportunity to see a film, on the silver screen, which leaves you enriched by the immaculate craft of the filmmaker's original voice and style of storytelling? How often does a movie leave you inspired to just grab a stack of paper and a pen, and begin writing your very own story? Bong Joon-Ho's Parasite is definitely one of those movies which left me moved and inspired. It's one of those movies which beautifully broadened my view towards the world. This film tackles social issues in a visually visceral and cinematic manner; it doesn't rely on preachy monologues and melodramatic action to convey its underlying themes of class discrimination, greed, family, and morality. Bong Joon-Ho and his writer, Han Jin-won, craft the screenplay in a subtle style in order to convey the social issues that are revolving around the film. Parasite tells the story of the Kim family, which is made of four individuals: a father, a mother, a teenage boy, and a teenage girl. This family takes interest in the Park family, who are incredibly rich and wealthy, when the teenage boy, played exceptionally by Choi Woo-shik, takes over his friend's job as an English tutor for the daughter of the Park family, who is a sophomore in high school. The film proceeds with the Kim family obtaining the various jobs around the house of the Park family, who are unaware of this. From there one, Bong Joon-Ho and his writer, Han Jin-won, tell a beautiful story of family, class discrimination, empathy, and morality in a satirical and dark manner. Parasite embodies a countless number of flawless moments of storytelling, which can leave one entertained, thrilled, and moved. Bong Joon-Ho utilizes visual storytelling to not only heighten the thrills, but using minute details to depict the discriminations that are made between the rich and the poor. There are two scenes which depict the way the rich and the poor perceive heavy rainfalls. The Park family are enamored by the sight and scenery of the rain from their window. Whereas the Kim family, struggle to grab their personal belongings due to their basement apartment being flooded by the rainfall. Yang Jin-mo's editing immerses the viewer in these visually engaging scenes. There is one moment where she uses the shot of the overflowing water transitioning to a bird-eye shot of the Kim family and their neighbors struggling to take the water out of their homes by using buckets. This is what makes Parasite shine as this visual experience, where we as an audience, understand both sides of the coin. The audience is able to grasp a sense of the struggles that the poor have to face, and this is done with incredible cinematography by Hong Kyung-pyo. The performances of Parasite are incredible. Each actor provides a nuanced and authentic performance; they faithfully portray the psychology of their characters. Another incredibly refreshing aspect of this film was how Bong Joon-ho and his writer, Han Jin-won, portray the Park family. They aren't portrayed as stingy rich people, they are kind, caring, and naïve. They are naïve to the point where they are baffled by the smell of a poor individual. Bong Joon-ho authentically depicts the humanity of both the wealthy and impoverished characters of the film. The way the characters are crafted and portrayed is what allows the film to augment Bong Joon-ho's original voice as a storyteller. Parasite is not only the best film I have seen this year; it is the best film I have seen this decade. Thank you, Bong Joon-ho for crafting a tour de force of a film. Thank you for reassuring me, as an aspiring storyteller, that stories build bridges of unity. Thank you of inspiring me to write a story that is original and deeply resonates with my memory and my heart. As the great Japanese filmmaker, Akira Kurosawa once said, ""If you genuinely want to make movies, start writing screenplays. Take a lot of paper and a pen, and just write, write, and write."" Bong Joon-ho's masterpiece, Parasite, inspired me to go home and take a lot of paper and a pen, and just write the stories I want to tell. Thank you, Bong Joon-ho for shrewdly crafting a masterpiece that beautifully depicts the themes of class discrimination and filiality."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Easily, one of the best movies of the year, because of many aspects: First, the acting is awesome, really strong performances by everyone. Second, the story is very interesting. And last but not least, the sequence of events in this movie is one if the year's best. I mean, every act is great on its own, but if you put them all together, you will witness a Masterpiece, and if you watch any of them by itself, you will get an amazing short-film. Considering thd Oscars, this one is a strong nomination for Best Foreign Language Picture and I wouldn't be surprised if it gets a nomination for The Best Picture award."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"This movie is clever on so many levels, the acting is impeccable, the story-line unexpected and the directing flawless but I don't want to give too much away, just watch it. In this era of super heroes and sequels, this is a breath of fresh air and a sign that there's still hope for the craft."
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"It was pretty dang good man, I just personally thought it was a bit overrated. Maybe I'm to simple to get the major messages of the film, but hey man, check it out. This movie is a piece of film history."
기생충,Parasite,2019,1,,"I can't believe that this movie is being called a masterpiece, it was ok at best. To me it feels like the director wanted to represent the feelings of the lower class population towards the rich but he failed miserably because its potrayal of both the rich and the poor is so illogical, I honestly felt like I was watching an adaptation of a bad fanfic. I think only people who are easily impressed would enjoy this movie."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,I thought I knew what was happening but it turns out I didnt even know what I didnt know. Cinematography was so well done. Comedy relief at the exact moments it needed it. My stress levels at a max the entire last quarter I had to physically cover my gaping mouth with my hand.
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"The only reason I'm giving it a 8 it's because I wouldn't watch it again. Gave me so many emotions, it was a whole rollercoaster. I felt anxious, worried, sad, and even happy at some point. Made me feel fear at so many scenes, it really plays with your mind.  Masterpiece? Yes. Would I watch it again? Heck no."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Last night was one of the most thrilling experiences I have had watching a film..  I attended a small arthouse theatre close to 15 minutes from my house. I finally saw a movie I had been yearning for some time. I am a little late to the party, in regards to my timing of this film. But I am ecstatic I got to view it in a theatre. I wanted to go in with no expectations, because typically I am let down. I have a tendency nitpick as a viewer, which can make some movies difficult to enjoy. I was aware that it had won best foreign film at the Golden Globes, and had received much critical acclaim. I cannot recall seeing another Bong Joon Ho film, except possibly The Host (in which case, it was so long ago- I do not remember). Either way, I was excited to see a movie that looked like a family drama, with perhaps some suspenseful elements.  As I sat in this small cleanly theatre, I noticed the majority of people were of Asian descent, and unless my eyes betrayed me, mostly Korean. I attend movies frequently and it was nice to see a very diverse crowd. As the lights dimmed and people munched on their popcorn, and drank their coke's; I sat there, by myself- as the only one in my row. Ready to have a fun experience, with what's been regarded as one of the best of the year. The first portion of the movie, centers around an engaging Korean family who live in a lower-class part of the city looking for jobs. They live in a home that is underground, but can still see the street through one of the windows. The family consists of a young adolescent brother and sister as well as their middle-aged parents. The movie begins with raucous laughs and instantly makes you engaged with these characters. The first 30 mins is truly a full-blown comedy and my theatre could not stop laughing. In its own right it is a very effective comedy, that had hints of possible dread ahead. The hints at suspense begin when another family is brought into the story. We see how both of these families become entangled in each other's lives, and how the threads are tied together. The pace was slower in the early stages, but still immensely entertaining.  Then there is a tonal flip. A character re-enters the story and you instantly feel tight. At this point you could not really tell where the story was headed, so I stayed in peak curiosity. Then comes a moment when dread absolutely swept over me and I felt as if the story was about to turn into a full-blown horror movie. I sat there in near dread, caught in my own amazement of what I was watching. The tension then softened a bit, but there was still an underlay of tightness. The whole tone of the movie had changed by this point, and you can feel the stress the characters are going through. As well as the fact that the viewer knows more than some of the characters on screen, so there are moments when you want to shout at the screen- DON'T LOOK THERE! Within a few minutes though, you are immersed in the new direction the story has gone in and what's happening. It was fun to follow the story's new direction, with a good level of suspense at this point. You can feel everything is on the brink of destruction, but its still being held together by a thread. Then the story levels off a little bit, heading an even different direction. In this sequence the story is setting up a finale, that will leave devastation. Once we get started in the third act, my jaw just about hit the floor and I was stunned. The final 20 minutes of this people was honestly breathtaking. The music, visuals, acting and the tone of the story hits you like a ton of bricks. By the time the final credits rolled, I sat there in utter amazement. It was the first time I left a theatre feeling utter euphoria. I was absolutely ecstatic with what I had just seen.  Parasite is a film that brings together a plethora of genres that all coalesce effectively. There is an underlying theme of classism and how the social construct of class impacts the psyche of the characters. But this is truly a story that has many layers, and the shifting tones create an atmosphere that is both eerily terrifying as well as holistically captivating.  Grade: A+"
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"This movie has 2 parts, the first one a kind of comedy, but too much smart, and the second is a complete tragedy, This year the Oscar Awrd is very interesting, there are wonderful movies and Parasite is one of them"
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"A family who doesn't have a lot of money or opportunities in life, starts working for a wealthy family. But will this change the life of the poor family?  DIRECTOR: Bong Joon Ho SCREENWRITERS: Bong Joon Ho, Han Jin Wan CAST: Song Kang Ho, Lee Sun Kyun, Cho Yeo Jeong, Choi Woo Shik, Park So Dam, Lee Jung Eun, Chang Hyae Jin In the movie, we follow the Kim family who doesn't have much money. By chance, the son in the family starts working for the wealthy Park family. He teaches their daughter English. Now the rest of the family sees opportunities to make money, and they have a plan to remove the rest of the staff who work for the wealthy Park family and then take the jobs themselves.  Bong Joon Ho addresses deeper themes, but he always manages to create entertainment and some surprising scenes that bring out the smile. The movie is mostly charming until the Kim family discovers the big secret of the house.  Then the movie starts to get darker, and it explodes into a wonderful finale where we see and understand the message of the movie. The title of the movie turns things on its head. Because what I thought to be quite obvious at the beginning of the movie is turned upside down and I got an aha experience. Parasites are found in all classes of society.  From a technical aspect I think this was a beautifully crafted film from the direction to the cinematography. There are so many beautiful scenes in the movie, and it's pretty well done considering that most of the action takes place inside the big house and the not so big garden.My favorite sequence is when the Kim family has to run home when the rain is pouring down, and you feel like they're on board the Titanic. They must run from the top and down to the engine room. What a wonderful sequence, and it's so beautiful to watch!  The cast was fantastic, and everyone fit the needs of their roles. The characters were well-written with the performances complementing that perfectly. It does a great job of creating a collection of characters that feel like real people, whom despite their eccentricities, maintained a grounded, realistic feel.The musical score complements the scenes nicely and elevates the emotional responses without feeling overbearing.  So, if you like foreign films, thrillers, or movies that can make you think a little check this one out. It's a crisp film from a technical aspect, and with a blend of great writing and acting you can't go wrong. It was a solid film that treats the audience with intelligence. 9/10"
기생충,Parasite,2019,,,"One of my best films, rarely comes across such a fascinating work that satisfies the soul's need to receive and taste creativity and art. According to Hegel, the soul also has its needs,i think that the parasite has fulfilled it."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"I enjoyed this movie, however my expectations were so much higher than it delivered based on the hype  Its good, but not top 50 good  I feel being a foreign language film gives it some level of credit with critics keen to promote something cool/exotic  Ask yourself how this film would have been received if set in US or UK and in English ? I feel it then would be just a good 7 out of 10 dark comedy / farce.  Definitely worth seeing, don't let the hype set your expectations too high and you'll enjoy it for what it is."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Usually it has been observed that the movies start with high ratings because fans give the highest possible ratings initially but when more people watch them the ratings decline, but this one going up in the chart.  This says a lot about this one.  Another Korean master piece after Oldboy. Don't miss it, thanks me later."
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"Well, I can't understand how this film defeated The Joker and 1917 at the Oscars.  Nice movie, yes, but not spectacular.  A lot of plot shortcuts, as if the poor family were world class con artists. So illogical."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Winner of the Palme d'Or for Best Film in Cannes 2019, to say «Parasite» is to speak of five shining stars in the cinematic firmament. When you have to spill blood in a film, you have to dose it with genius, hit the target and know where and when to spill it with cunning and, above all, understand well why we spill it and get the viewer to understand that reason as well.  Don't get me wrong «Parasites» is not a bloody drama, but a beautiful film that with humor and gravity touches the three classic themes of art: it is a tragicomedy about love, life and death, it is a film about the joy of living, about survival, about the family of the 21st century, but not like the concept of family defined and defended by many, that sick, stifled definition, confined to religious dogmas and eulogistic of expired and obsolete values. It is about real and living families of the planet in 2019, many dispossessed and a few privileged, in a game of services and currency exchanges, in the last days of capitalism with its agenda of violence, horror and death.  Although director Bong Joon-ho has already made about ten feature films of various themes, I only know one of his films, the cult fable «The Guest», a horrific science fiction tale about the relationships within a poor and dysfunctional family of Seoul, that is put in check when a monster generated by the toxins thrown into the Han River by an American scientist, kidnaps a young member of that family nucleus. Again, in «Parasite», Bong addresses the family issue, opposing a poor family made up of the parents and two children, to a rich family with the same number of members. The moment they cross roads is the basis of the story. A third component, personified by a housekeeper, gives an unexpected twist to the story and leads to the violent climax, which is not the end of the fascinating story; at this point of the story, it still has another 15 minutes of history to tell, until the sad final close-up that ends this work.  When I watch films like ""Parasites"" my heart skips a beat, I wish that people would have access to a wide and cultured film offer, that we all could see works like this instead of consuming the despicable L.A. garbage that the cinemas offer, week after week, freezing the reasoning of people from the whole world; or having to wait for an exclusive film festival to project them fleetingly, and to be subject to serials of thrones and other lousy dishes. As soon as «Parasite» appears through any of the windows we have today to watch movies, don't miss it."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Definitely one of the best movies I've seen in the recent years. The laughter, the suspense, the shock, ... and especially the hilarious twist in the middle! At the same time it presents a wonderful critique of society. I just LOVED it. Everything you'd expect of a Korean movie and more."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,Just WOW. I loved every second of this film. The cinematography is on point! Such a beautiful film and such a great plot! Go see this movie!!
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,Brilliant . First time have seen a Korean film and cannot be more impressed. It's like Satyajit Ray meets Quentin Tarantino .. Social Cast issue with so many symbolysims meet brutal reality and violence.. depicted in a witty thriller .  Kudo's
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Bong Joon-Ho is an outstanding director, and this might be his best work yet. Parasite is one of the best movies of the entire decade, hell I'd go as far as saying no other movie this decade quite matches it. It's funny, it's heartbreaking, it's intense. It does all of this while not feeling tonally inconsistent or confused, which is something that many films fail to do. The acting is incredible and the characters themselves are fantastic, with no good guys or bad guys: They're people. They feel like real and believable characters, which is such a refreshing change of pace from all of the bloated action movies that we get every year. It's well shot, as to be expected, and the social commentary is fantastic.  This is the first movie I've seen in the longest time that I can describe as perfect, I loved every single bit of it."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Parasite (2019)  10/10 💸  ""Such immense effort put into a film about the high and low class, Parasite is as surprising as it is a nail biter that keeps you guessing until the very end.""  The struggle of money is a huge and impactful aspect of the everyday lives us human beings go through everyday. No matter the case, desperation is imminent and dire actions come into play. Parasite does away with telling a tale of class, greed and the values or family. Director Bong Joo-ho, who brought you The Host and Snowpiercer, creates a layered masterpiece that keeps you on edge every second due to the flawless writing and acting within acting (if you watch you'll understand) that keeps Parasite from ever falling under. Even the score and cinematography assist the film in being anxiety inducing. Although it is considered a crime/comedy, I found Parasite to be a scary type of film. Think about it, manipulation can occur at the hand of anyone that remotely tries it, no matter how witty and/or smart the victim is. The horrors of reality stand and it is never too safe to be alert of the occurrences that surround you. Getting to the ending, which I will discuss briefly without giving anything away, is the kind of ending that provokes nervous laughter at the hand of suddenness and sensibility. It's one of those endings that involve so much, but that much just happens to work so well in the film's favor. It's haunting, it's daunting and serves the purpose of leaving a mark.  Verdict: Parasite is one of a kind and is easily one of the best films of the year. There's nothing to not like about this and it'll sure stay with you after the first viewing."
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,I don't want to be a troll but this movie is a bit overrated i think. We have much better dramas in Turkish cinema.
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Go for it, and you'll not be disappointed. Go for it, and you'll not be disappointed. Go for it, and you'll not be disappointed."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"I do recommend this film but it definitely isn't the rip roaring masterpiece you read about comparing it to classics like The Godfather, Casablanca, etc. Why it received so many accolades is beyond me. Probably because it stuck out amongst a sea of mediocre films. The acting was fine. It's the story itself that left a lot to be desired. I really had high hopes going into this one. At least it didn't fall knee deep into the Korean trope of crying crying crying till every handkerchief is dripping wet."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,Opening scene .. quite funny .. and wity .. movie goes in a very funny way and .. keep us for there .. later the movie is gets involving and .. stroy pick ups yhe the pace ... hats off to the actors .. and director giving a such good content .. it's not a movie it's ART .. MUST WATCH MOVIE
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"I've wanted to see this awhile, but the consistent rave reviews actually made me hesitate and put it off, for fear of disappointment...nothing is ever that good... but I genuinely and thoroughly loved this!  The themes are common enough, but told in such a way, and with such a unique story, to be legitimately fresh. The subtle nuances of performance can sometimes get lost in subtitles, but not in this case - each actor transcends language in conveying their character. The plot twists and turns between random chuckles and stark darkness from the start to the shocking, sad and satisfying finish.  The hype is real - definitely one of the best movies of the year, and of recent years. Don't miss it."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"First off, I feel like you either get this movie or you don't, that simple. There Is so much thought provoking duality that comes into play, those who rate it poorly seem to miss this part of the story. I don't want to give spoilers but if you truly allow yourself to go on the emotional roller coaster that this movie is, it will leave you thinking about all the twists and turns for days."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Parasite is a very rare film. IMDb have it listed as a 'Comedy, Drama, Thriller'. These three just don't do it justice. It certainly has some very funny moments ... but it's equally depressing and sad (both in a good way) as it deals with tough subjects like injustice, poverty and class. It certainly is a drama; each character has multiple situations ranging from normality to crisis. We watch as these scenarios merge and cultivate themes and topics to contemplate. Yes, you guessed it ... it's also a thriller; the storytelling beautifully builds up, twists and works to a crescendo.  However, the film has so much more. There's plenty of argument to add 'Horror, Romance or Crime' which are all blended into the colourful narrative. Plus, this film is the quintessential 'Family' film; yes, the families are in 'interesting' situations, but the shades develop and raise questions on many layers. The fact this film can do all of this and stay even remotely coherent explains why the film is rare. The credit should go to the sharp writing and directing of Bong Joon Ho and the brave and touching work of the actors.  Now ... it's a long way from 'perfect' in my opinion. I've scored this film a 10 here as it just crept into the required range with 91/100 using my own scoring system (I have my own detailed method). It's certainly true that some people won't enjoy this film. Of course, the genre mix I describe above may put people off straight away. Without saying too much that gives anything important away some might feel the underlying themes have been done before and that the film can feel confused and ambiguous (on a variety of subjects and positions). You may also need to deal with a film without an obvious 'hero', characters with whom you may struggle to empathise (especially by the end) and an 'unlikely' main plot and close.  Personally, none of these impacted my enjoyment of the movie in a significant way. I'd primarily put this down to the direction, screenplay and acting. There are small moments in the film, which resonate as they underpin the themes. I found 'Parasite' thought provoking and engaging throughout."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,My favorite movie of 2019.. Hope it gets Oscar for best Picture
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"This movie is a masterpiece I really had good times watching ever minute of it. From the topnotch storytelling to the ideas it portraits, its definitely a movie that will stick in your head far after the credits."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,Its a very good movie thats it. but very overrated.
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"First Hit: I really enjoyed this story as it dives from the hilarious into the absurd.  We are introduced to this South Korean family (the Kim family) as they are getting ready to eat. The below ground level home has few street-level windows as they look up from the table to see a drunk young man peeing on a wall near their home.  We can tell the family is barely making it financially from the looks of the room, the view outside the room, and by their sparse, cryptic, and entertaining conversation. However, they seem to be engaged in their lives and hopeful because they are talking about the language of scheme making.  The family consists of the father Ki-taek (played by Song Kang-ho), the mother Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin), the son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik), and the daughter Ki-woo (Park So-dam).  Ki-woo's friend Min-hyuk (Park Seo-joon) comes by their home, wanting to give Ki-woo a present. It is a rock sculpture that is supposed to bring economic well-being. Because Min-hyuk has to leave town for a while, he tells Ki-woo about a tutoring gig he wants him to take over while he's gone. The subject of his tutoring is a rich high school girl named Park Dye-hye (Jung Ji-so). Dye-hye's mother, Park Yeon-kyo (Jo Yeo-jeong), Min-hyuk says, isn't too bright, so he should easily pass the interview. Ki-woo expresses his worries that he'll be found out and may not be good enough, but Min-hyuk assures him that even though he's only got a high school education, he'll dazzle the ditzy Mrs. Park.  When asking Min-hyuk why he's giving him this offer, Min-hyuk explains that he didn't want one of his college friends doing the gig because he loves this girl, wants to date her when she's out of high school and knows that Ki-woo is a true friend and wouldn't cross him in this way.  Arriving at the Park home, he's let in by the housekeeper Gook Moon-gwang (Lee Jung-eun). Walking through the house, he's amazed at what a sizeable beautiful home it is. It's very modern and filled with all the luxuries he's never known and only dreamed about. The interview with Mrs. Park goes very well, and he's hired to tutor Dye-hye. Noticing artwork around the home, he asks about it. The mother explains that it is her wild son who shoots bows and arrows around the house. But he's also an artist and Mrs. Park thinks her son could be compared to the Andy Warhol anointed artist Jean-Michael Basquiat.  Seeing an opportunity and because the family is wealthy and pays well, he says he may know of a young woman who is an Art Therapist that could work with the boy to become a great artist. Getting home, he tells his family about this and his sister is ready to do her part and take on a new role as Art Teacher and Therapist.  I'll leave the rest to your imagination, but let's just say the family all participates in this adventure.  But when the wealthy family takes a camping vacation, and the old housekeeper comes to collect something she left behind, the whole story starts to turn towards the macabre.  Parasite is a perfect name for the film, and it is not easy to pin down all the aspects this film offers the viewer. As it won the Cannes Palme d'Or for best film and I can see why.  Song, as the patriarch of the Kim family, was exquisite in embodying this character. Early in the film, when he announces that they need to leave the windows open when the street fumigators come down the street, I knew I was in for a ride. It was perfect for setting up his mindset. His silent looks while driving Mr. Park around after he learns that the Park's think he and his family smell, are spot on. Jo was excellent as Mrs. Park. Her expressions when buying into the stories shared Ki-woo and Ki-jung were priceless. She was the perfect foil and focal point of the Park family. Choi was terrific as the Kim family young man. His wistful story at the end of the film about finding his father was excellent. Park was sublime as the Kim family daughter turned instant Art Therapist. Her embodying the story she made up for herself was funny, engaging, and perfect. Jang, as mother to the Kim children, made me laugh. Her actions and responses during the opening scenes while the family was eating were scene-stealing. Lee Sun-kyun was outstanding as Mr. Park. His command of the family as he waltzed in from work was evident and clearly identified who was in charge of the Park family. Lee Jung-eun, as the housemaid for the Park family, was engaging. Her arriving back to collect what she left in the basement under the kitchen opened the door for the film to move to another level. Bong Joon-ho and Han Jin-won wrote a wildly entertaining screenplay that had both funny and dark edges. Joon-ho was outstanding directing this film. Some of the shots, especially as the family tried to get back home during a major storm, told much of the story. The direct downward view of the slums in which they lived, being flooded, was telling. Just as the shots of the luxurious home where they worked were just the opposite; clean, crisp, and wonderfully shot with various angles.  Overall: This is a contender for Best Foreign Film and maybe even Best Picture."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"This doesn't seem like an oscar - winning picture. There is no doubt of the good acting delivered by the actors ; each characters has its own personality and the plot is twisting enough. The whole story is quite metaphoric,hinting the notion of class struggle. However , in my opinion I think the metaphors are too explicit and at the same time can be disturbing. It just ain't oscar- wrothy!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,1,,"When I find myself constantly looking at my watch and asking when a film is going to deliver any of the promises that the Critics and Reviewers have seen fit to lavish on it then there's something awry. This isn't scathing socio-political cinema...it's not black comedy, in fact it's not remotely amusing or believable or even sympathetic to any of its characters. It's a simple hype job. The movie here is the real Parasite."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Lot of comments on how this movie is mediocre and overrated I'm sure those people have rated starwars and avengers 10 on10. If you have watched some good old Korean movies such as bediveled, old boy, yellow sea and memories of murder you know this movie stands on equal footing with those movie I've watched joker Fordvs Ferrari Jojo rabbit 1917 Marriage story  Parasite beats all these movies by a huge difference."

기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"I doubt that there's a better film out there than this masterpiece in 2019!  Almost everything about this film was perfect with numerous messages, elements and layers.  The production and performance were magnificent. The humour ""Black comedy"" was great, the ""Pain"" was real and the cinematography was dazzling.  I'd like to thank Bong Joon-ho in person for this masterpiece!  ""Poverty and being indecisive can make life a perfect mess and miserable""  9.2/10"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I felt a roller coaster of emotions watching this movie; everything about it so perfectly executed. What makes this movie insanely good is the actors, story, plot and narrative.  Wow, just wow. I truly believe this movie, for me is going to be best movie watched for 2020. It's only January I know, but how the hell do you top this???"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Finally a masterpiece. It has been some time since I watched suck a brilliant movie. Put it simply, everything about it is perfect. The story, the acting, the cinematography, the score...and the amazingly beautiful end. Applauses!!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I don't often give a 10 but I simply have no complaints. This was an enthralling watch - even as I watched it with the subtitles! So smart. There were many angles and I'm not sure what the genre is. First the humour got me, then the characters got me, then the main plot got me, then the drama got me, the sadness got me and the horror got me. So entertaining, eyes peeled kind of stuff. You have no idea where its going to go. I found myself really rooting for the main characters and the topics are so relevant. Korean cinema - i am watching out for gems like this. Really, a clever, entertaining brilliant film. Watch it."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,Korean film makers literally have such a interesting mind. Absolutely unique and a film I'll never forget!
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"This film started well and I liked the opening dialog and the concept, but this film is simply not worthy of a Best Picture Oscar. There were too many disjointed scenes and bad editing. I think I need to see some more of this directors other films. I watched Okja and thought it was poor, so not sure what all the hype is about. 6/10 No doubt it will be remade Hollywood stylie but I wont be bothering to see it."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"This is something that stays with you for life. Whether good or bad, it shows it. Never have I seen a movie about classic stereotypes and used them in such a creative way that it's almost something entirely different.  Anxiety is something I'd define this movie as. It's edge of your seat, heart in your stomach and hoping. Then it happens."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Whether you're a hardcore cinephile or a normal movie-goer, Bong-joon-ho's Parasite has got something for everyone. This genre-defying film picks up the social differences between rich and poor and mix it up with some of the best twists in the entire history of cinema."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"It's hard to describe this movie, i will just say this is a critical point of view about the modern family and society. The transformation from a light comedy to a strange disturbing and a violent movie is unbelievable..... the party scene is a beautiful philosophical portrait about humans, this is truly a Powerful masterpiece."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"It is hard to talk about this film without spoiling it surprises, so I will basically write a love letter to Bong Joon Ho's brilliant new movie. He effortlessly builds tension, while bringing so many other elements (Slapstick! Horror!) in telling the story a poverty-stricken family climbing for higher ground on the backs of the elite. It is a moving, funny, and above all else enlightening take on how the war of the classes leaves many, many casualties. Best film of 2019."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I don't even know what to say about this movie. Just go watch it. I watched it more than a month ago and I still think about it everyday.  It has so many layers. This movie really impressed me, it was a completely different experience of what I was waiting for and I absolutely love that. It catched me off guard.  It's such a fantastic social commentary."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Original, creative, involving story.  Great acting with a crisp production.  One of the best in 2019"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,Despite being incredibly edited and filmed. Beautiful dark cinematography. This movie takes you on a full on ride that no one is waiting for. The surprise factor and the randomness of the situations just keep adding up none stop. With a break point that leaves you with that empty feeling that something just ducked your soul and destroyed you inside but at the same time made you laugh and stay on deep silence to just digest.  Starting of by showcasing extremely complex characters you already know that you signed up for something entirely unusual. Lies and desperation can lead to absolute apocalypse. Every single scene adds to the story but it also makes it more twisted and complicated.  Do yourself a favor and watch this film.
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"Parasite stands as a cinematic tour de force, a film that transcends genres and defies easy categorization. Bong Joon-ho's directorial brilliance is on full display in this Korean masterpiece, a compelling and thought-provoking exploration of class divisions that seamlessly weaves together dark humor, suspense, and social commentary.  From the opening scenes, it captivates with its meticulous attention to detail and visual storytelling. The cinematography by Hong Kyung-pyo is nothing short of breathtaking, capturing the stark contrast between the cramped living conditions of the Kim family and the opulent luxury of the Park residence. Each frame is a visual feast, contributing to the film's immersive experience.  The narrative unfolds with a gripping precision, as the Kim family, struggling in the lower echelons of society, cunningly infiltrates the lives of the wealthy Park family. The plot twists and turns with a surprising and relentless momentum, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats. Bong Joon-ho's screenplay is a work of art, seamlessly blending elements of comedy, drama, and thriller into a cohesive and engaging story.  Central to the film's success are the stellar performances from the cast. Song Kang-ho leads with a nuanced portrayal of the patriarch, Kim Ki-taek, navigating the complexities of his character with finesse. The entire ensemble, including Choi Woo-shik, Park So-dam, and Lee Sun-kyun, deliver performances that breathe life into their multifaceted roles, creating a palpable on-screen chemistry.  The movie is more than just a suspenseful thriller; it's a profound commentary on societal inequality. Bong Joon-ho skillfully uses the Kim family's strategic infiltration of the Park household as a lens through which to examine the stark contrasts between the haves and the have-nots. The film prompts viewers to reflect on the systemic issues of class disparity and the lengths individuals may go to escape the constraints of poverty.  Beyond its social commentary, it also explores the universality of human desires and the consequences of unchecked ambition. The characters, while navigating their respective socio-economic challenges, grapple with themes of morality, identity, and the pursuit of a better life.  In conclusion, this is a cinematic triumph, a film that not only entertains but also challenges and provokes thought. Bong Joon-ho's masterful direction, coupled with outstanding performances and a richly layered narrative, makes it a standout in contemporary cinema. This Korean gem deserves every accolade it has received, marking a pivotal moment in the global recognition of the richness and depth of Korean filmmaking."
기생충,Parasite,2019,5,,"Just won Oscars cz concept was new, but this itself doesn't make it a better movie than Joker. Over hyped, Mediocre and people reviewing it in mob mentality. Nothing against Korean movies."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I reserve 10 stars for only the cream of the crop, and I can safely say after one viewing that this was just that.  Masterfully done in every aspect. All of the acting, camerawork, and design was fitting and never over the top.  The plot was wonderfully paced and the organic tension created was very effective. Furthermore, this movie had much to say thematically and did a incredible job conveying those thematic elements while staying within itself.  I don't want to spoil even the slightest minor detail so that every viewer can enjoy this movie; as we are all only lucky enough to experience one so brilliant every five years or so. All I would advise is that you do see it, and for those of you averse to foreign films, don't let it impede you. It truly is the finest movie I've seen in recent memory. You'll forget it was in Korean."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Just wow! Not an easy watch, that's for sure, but I LOVED every moment of it. The actors were exceptional, the directing and writing was outstanding, not to mention all the fantastic metaphors that this movie was built on. What I really liked is that there is no ""good guy"" and ""bad guy"" in this story. The one you feel sorry for, later you can get really angry at, and the other that you don't like at first, you can feel for them somehow in the end - at least I did. I didn't expect a lot of things that happened in this movie and the surprises were all great. Altogether for me, this movie is like a dark but true and beautiful poem. I was in my thoughts because of it for 2 days straight, couldn't get it out of my head. I could talk about it and all the problems in life it shed a light on, for hours afterwards. Absolutely a must watch!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"The dark satirical thriller, directed by Bong Joon-ho, began in a very scampering fashion with the mention of the word ""metaphor"" for countless amount of time. And as you'd usually expect from a Bong film, the metaphor then played a key role throughout yhe film as the name - ""Parasite"" - suggests. Though, it depends on how you take it & what you'd like to call it because ""stairway"" remains as another option as well. How? That's the beauty of this two hour long flick. Why? Let's discuss!  And to begin with, there's the plot that on paper didn't particularly make a lot of sense as it's expected from a satire in general. But the layers beneath and the sui generis usage of the metaphor illustrated the beauty, giving the film a base to build upon. No matter how unrealistic and chaotic the occuring events were, the joyousness kept emanating throughout while keeping a lot of space for sympathy and questions in a sublime pace and lighthearted tone initially. Supported by a colourful yet limited and very important cast with a lot of depth. Each and every actors, in their respective roles, probably have outdone themselves in that regard.  On a technical note, the cinematography in particular, deserves a lot of credits. Hong Kyung-pyo managed to capture the essence of two types of Korea, something which was extremely important for the film in itself, while keeping everything so simplistic and relatable. The entire set-up of the film, that provided the innocence and realistic touch, deserves a lot of extolling. At the end, the editing acted as needle that knitted everything together. Supervised by CJ Productions (and of course, Bong) with a tight budget, it'd be totally unfair not to mention how impressed I've been by their mind-blowing piece of work.  But everything aside, what packs the ultimate punch? The theme of differences of classes and how it's showcased through the ""stairways."" Call it pessimistic as you may like, or realistic for the sake of argument, the harsh reality doesn't change. That said, do you stop dreaming? No. But sometimes you get carried away in the sea of hopes, which may be ""greed"" for many. The dependency on lower classes & prison of wealth is something the film depicts so very uniquely. And the ending eventually solidified whatever, pessimistic for some and realistic for many, Bong wanted to claim; or rather ask you. With a lot of differences of opinions on its simplistic yet so complicated ending scene, one thing remains certain - you're bound to fall in love with this masterpiece, that sure does have the potential to snatch the ""Best Picture"" award at the gala night of Academy Awards 2020!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"This movie reminds me of Life is Beautiful in its life hacks very subtly written, amazing comedia I am sure it will win Best Foreign Picture at the Oscars And it deserves more than this Best Korean movie ever made! ----------  I went crazy when it won, it's masterpiece that will stay forever, and Bong Joon Ho will be a Korean idol"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"This movie is a masterpiece. It is well casted and acted, the cinematography was very well done. The themes are thought provoking. But the greatest thing about this movie is how much love, effort and dedication went into this. This movie has every genre in it, yet it doesn't feel too cramped. It might be unrealistic and some parts but the story was so amazing. The little details in this movie is what makes it a modern day masterpiece.  Parasite is one of those movies that you will never forget and rewatch it over and over again. It is such a fine experience watching this movie, and everything is perfect about it. 10/10"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,Best movie of 2019. I am in awe. In fact it's one the best movies i have ever seen in my life. What a masterpiece no wonder it won the top award at the cannes film festival. You can never guess what is going to happen next or how it will end. Damn !! Wow and it begs the question who is the victim here?
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,The best movie l've seen! I wanna see it again! You mast see!
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"""Parasite,"" directed by Bong Joon-ho, is a masterful blend of dark comedy, social commentary, and thrilling drama. The film follows the impoverished Kim family as they con their way into working for the wealthy Park family, leading to unexpected and shocking consequences.  The film's greatest strength lies in its storytelling. Bong Joon-ho skillfully balances humor and tension, keeping the audience engaged and on edge throughout. The screenplay is sharp and layered, offering biting commentary on class disparity and social inequality without being preachy.  The performances are stellar across the board. Song Kang-ho, as the Kim family patriarch, delivers a nuanced performance, while the rest of the cast, including Choi Woo-shik and Park So-dam, bring depth and authenticity to their roles.  Visually, ""Parasite"" is stunning, with meticulous attention to detail in its production design. The contrast between the Kims' cramped basement home and the Parks' luxurious mansion is striking and symbolic.  However, some viewers might find the film's tonal shifts jarring, and its ending, while impactful, may not satisfy everyone. Despite these minor issues, ""Parasite"" is a thought-provoking and well-crafted film that leaves a lasting impression. It's a unique cinematic experience that challenges and entertains in equal measure."
기생충,Parasite,2019,5,,"Parasite is in my opinion a very Korean movie. What do I mean with that? Well, I will get into that late, but firstly; it was directed by Bong Joon-ho, who is best known for his English language movies ""Snowpiercer"" and ""Okja"". Both movies while being overall pretty overdramatic and simple, they at least try to have an atmosphere. They also have a clear message, which however show a very naïve perspective on reality. Even his previous Korean language movies like ""mother"" and ""the host"" are very similar in that fashion. ""Parasite"" however doesn't really show much of that regard. Neither does it have a clear message nor any sort of atmosphere, which in my opinion is very reminiscent of many of the Korean movies I have seen (with the exception of the masterpieces ""Burning"" and ""April snow""). ""Parasite"" however does have an interesting idea behind it which makes it in my opinion the most bearable of the Bong movies. But that's the only thing good about the movie however, maybe besides the production value. The movie has nice set design and has some good shots in it. It is lacking in many other departments however. The characters, for example are terribly written. They are basically shallow and in some cases only 1 dimensional exaggeration of a single character drope making the movie sometimes feeling dragging and boring, because of its focus on the characters. The soundtrack is lacking with only a few classical pieces and they are not really well placed in the movie in order to create atmosphere, often time being played behind dialog conflicting with the exposition scenes (which shows that the production value wasn't well spend in all places). The acting is decent, considering the director. Nothing bad, but also nothing extraordinary. The story consists of many plot conveniences and a lot of shock factor which ruins the whole idea behind it and makes it very confusing.  So overall I would say this movie was pretty mediocre, that's why I said its pretty Korean. It had a nice idea but doesn't do much with it and only uses it for shock value. It has very uninteresting character and sometimes feels very boring because of it. It is ultimately a very forgettable movie and the only reason I will probably remember it is because it is overhyped by many (kinda like the Korean movie ""Oldboy"")"
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"I guess people can never fully understand poverty and what it can do to people. This is a very very powerful film. Very clever. But even this film can't depict the real poverty. If you've watched it and are reading this very review, you ain't poor. The real poor don't watch this film. This film might have depicted struggles. But real life is on another level.  And no I don't know what it's like either. But I can get a good taste of that idea when seeing the predators in the wild showing that numb gaze when they bites the neck of their prey. On their fierce face I don't see any extra thoughts. No concerns about ethnicity, pain or morality. But the absolute focus to end this hunt as quick as possible so that it could become dinner.  There isn't any flamboyance in that. There is only straight up desire. And the feed for that desire."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,Far and away one of the best films you'll ever see.
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Parasite is a film that leaves one immediately wanting to reevaluate what they just saw. Expertly directed, written, edited, acted, and shot, Parasite is a unique and terrifying movie experience best viewed without any warning"
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"Parasite is a deep, complex, layered, multidimensional and heartfelt portrayal of the class struggle and its gruesome ramifications existing in the present day South Korea. It is seen through a social prism where the haves are pitted against the haven'ts, the haven'ts are pitted against each other . It is also a subtle tale of the dangerous magnitude of the impacts of human greed and how nature backfires against a consumer culture. From the gift rock to the deluge towards the climax, Director Bong Joon Ho of 'Memories of Murder' and 'The Host' fame uses several metaphors to depict how nature backlashes against human's imperialistic pleasures . As a result, what starts in a mild satirical tone, climaxes in a disturbing manner, so much to the extent that even hours after finishing the movie, you can not actually get out of the eerie milieu of South Korean urban class struggle. This is no easy movie, let me remind you. But if you can finish the journey, it can stay with you forever, for the ample food for thought it offers. Truly a cinematic masterpiece from the ace Korean director. Predicting huge applause at the Academy Awards this year, may be the Holy Grail of movie making as well. A must watch for those who are cerebrally way ahead of the cheap DC Comics genre."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,This movie shows desires of poor which is all same in any country of world. well acted and well made film.
기생충,Parasite,2019,,,"The fourth movie I watched from the director. Gwoemul is still in the best movies I've watched. Although the subject of the movie in general was ordinary, it was fun to watch half the movie, other half bothered a little. I like it even though it can't give the effect I expected at the end. Acting and script were nice. Social messages were sufficient again. I like the movie but Gwoemul still best for me!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"Kim K'atek and his near do well family literally living in the lower depths catches a break when their son obtains employment as a tutor for a wealthy family. Craftily the family conspires to inveigle its way into the household of the Parks by getting the chauffeur and longtime housekeeper fired and setting themselves up inside the lavish domicile with a Garden of Eden for a front yard. Things quickly take a turn however when the housekeeper returns for something she left behind.  Working with basically two class defining sets Parasite is a well filmed an interesting watch with the plot slowly unfolding in a darkly comic fashion before going into self induced chaotic free fall from the plausible to the absurd with a hurried climax and unsatisfying epilogue. Director Joon Ho-Bong and cinematographer Kyong pyo Hong do an excellent job of contrasting settings, situations, jabs about class and characters early, equally dividing the roles of his adult characters all benign and petty in their own way. It adds to the fascination of where this slightly off balance plot is going when the wheels come off. With no end game to the plot Ho-Bong decides to end it in conflagration and an insipid post climax that demands it defy logic."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"This film is completely out of the box, a social critic that doesn't choose sides. An absolutely brilliant masterpiece that takes us to a roller coaster of emotions with some kind of new cinematographic genre, that shudder and leave us groundless in a state of deep reflection about the model of society in which we live in. For those looking for an innovative film, with an unusual style, and with a necessary and relevant reflexion, Parasite is the right and the better choice. Impressive work by the director."
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,Definitely not worth more than 8 stars. A good movie to watch at home but not at the theatre.
기생충,Parasite,2019,3,,"Richly appointed, a glitterati champagne Cannes launch to an inebriated fanfare of stratospheric expectation, then unexpectedly in mid-journey an iceberg crash, an unsettling sinking feeling, followed by an agonizingly slow cascade into drowning horror. Compared to another mediocre superhero movie it might rank favourably, but a far cry from Tati or Hitchcock. Closer to a stylish 70s exploitation film."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"Bong Joon Ho's tragicomedy that is a ""comedy without clowns, and tragedy without villains"" (Ho, 2019) is a masterful painting of the division between classes and all the implications and ramifications that come with it. Parasite puts us in the shoes of a low class family and walks us into the life of the elite, making sure to land both class' realities and idiosyncrasies precisely and delicately through the superb acting, meticulous production design and breath-takingly purposeful cinematography. Although the bold and blunt screenplay narrates and exposes our lack of empathy in dealing with people of different classes, refreshingly, the shot selection during a small scene in the second act shows the interaction of a house maid and her boss through the differing perspectives of an adult and a child. In this sequence the directory of photography first shows us the perspective of the adult wherein she is looking over at the boss and her maid and sees a clear visual divide between the two. When the camera shows us the same scene from the perspective of the child, no such barrier is present, and they are on the same side. Bong Joon Ho has exquisitely created a universe that mirrors the realities of his home country today without knowing that the same story resonates through out the globe. Through the chaos that pursues because of the interlacing of these two contrasting families both in the film and in our everyday lives, I believe we need to go back to the mindset of a child wherein we stop seeing people as defined by their social economic status and strive to see each other simply as humans."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"It's not a horror nor alien movie despite the title and cover. Nevertheless, the storyline kept me on edge the entire time. The concept is so interesting, even though it's common one. The development is very unique, and I was pleasantly surprised. There was never a dull moment!  Given the premise of the story, it was interesting to see the prevalence of the family bond in the movie. That aspect of it was very touching.  I found the ending good, but a little bland given everything the story went through.  Great movie, very psycho!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Parasite is the heart-breaking and mind-shattering story of a poor south Korean family slowly inserting themselves into the life of a much wealthier one, through schemes, intense plotting and brilliantly written twists. Disguising itself, at first, as a comedy layered with social criticism, the film reveals itself to be a raw dramatic thriller verging on horror of great genius, with moments that will literally take your breath away. Bong Joon-ho crafts a near-perfect movie, with top-notch careful directing, beautifully flawed and intense writing, heart-wrenching performances and emotionally charged visuals. But in the end, ""Parasite"", isn't a comedy, it isn't horror, it isn't a thriller and it isn't a drama, it is FILM and that's what is so painfully gorgeous about it. 9,8 / 10"
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"This film is amazing. Mixes elements of comedy, suspense, and drama in a beautiful manner. I forgot I was reading subtitles after the film, as I was so engaged during the screening. Fantastic plot twists and very interesting and unique character developments. Would give 10th star if it weren't for a couple plot holes."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,What can one not love about this movie...the movie operates at so many layers of metaphors and ironies...the best that has come out of South Korea till date...expect some fireworks this Oscar season...#Bonghive  the movie basically portrays class divide in South Korea and symbiotic relationship between a rich and a poor family...the rich family is the proverbial host whereas the poor family...the Parasite!!!  The beauty of the movie lies a few layers beneath what is actually portrayed...how the parasite slowly befriends the host...and how it gradually morphs into something else completely...think of all the plot twists and their manifestations in society...specifically the relationship between the owner and the working class...just brings out global sentiments of Capitalism going crazy so beautifully!!!  As this movie is being released globally...I am sure the rankings and ratings will further improve...it was released in India around 1st Feb...this movie is a global phenomena considering the times we live in...Recommended...just go and watch this in your nearest theatre!!!
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"Cinematographically really an awesome film, great actors, storytelling, gripping. But maybe it´s only me, I can´t make out a plot that ties all together, unfortunately. So it remains a bunch of snipets, greatly shot clips, but the story loses itself if not in the worst of all, in oceandeep hopelessness, it is the saddest experience leaving the theatre. 9 for the pictures, 1 for the story. sorry no."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I just want to leave my opinion on this masterpiece, I love films from South Korea, and what makes me love them even more are these films that leave me thinking for three days in a row, the fact that the film always has several meanings and is brilliant I love the fact that every little detail always has a meaning, they are films like these with symbolism, mystery and messages to make the audience think that they are the best films for me!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,Literally the movie was good until the last 30 minutes were literally nothing main sense !!
기생충,Parasite,2019,5,,Absoultly Overrated movie. Its a normal movie not so so good
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"After this movie, I'm now ready to search Craigslist for available jobs for me, my friends and my family. I'm also gonna build myself a bunker."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"This is my first ever review. I saw it with my sister at the movie theatre. I never wanted to know anything about the movie in before hand and I've scouted the movie for a long time. Among the best movies I've ever seen. We were both laughing many times, even the slap stick could be funny. I had real hand sweat during scenes. The filming techniques are superb and a scene fade I've never seen before, gave me goosebumps. I like all the characters. Even though they are disgusting. I will see it again, Korean movies is something else, I love them."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"I watched this movie three times. it was fantastic and masterpiece like everyone said. there are tons of videos about this movie/subtext on youtube. I was wondering, while the director was reviewing the comments, was it something similar he thought during the filmmaking process or are people going too deep. light/dark, high/low, smell, rich/poor all these contrast are just beautiful."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Fascinating cinema that highlights how emotionally detached wealthy people can be. So many profound messages as it pertains to classism. Unexpected plot twists and all. I loved, loved, loved this movie."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"The movie was excellent in combining multiple genres like comedy, thriller & drama which is difficult to pull off. It definitely stood out of mass movie productions with its story, characters & plot twists.  Parasite has couple of things in its story which left question marks in my mind, but didn't effect it negatively.  My 10/10 is weighted by the fact that this kind of movie is very rare and the originality of the story leaves the viewer almost constantly surprised by the next turn of events."
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"It took almost 6 years to decide that I wanted to see this move. I have the feeling that in the past 10 years all the movies that won the Oscar are not interesting at all and don't really deserve an opportunity, but I gave it to Parasite.  The movie is just ""okish"", it has some memorable moments, but it does not get you hooked to it all the time. Actually some parts are quite boring and you can get distracted easily.  I don't really understand how it go so much success and won the Oscar. The direction is ok, I cannot say the opposite, but performances? No way, some of them near a series B Movie performance more than a movie that had won some Oscars!!  It's definitely OVERRATED!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"This is my second viewing of Parasite and it's just as good as the first time I saw it a few months ago. It's been winning lots of awards and deservedly so. Ki-taek and his family live in a dingy basement and struggle to make ends meet, but when they see an opportunity to insinuate themselves into the wealthy Park family they devise a plan that, at first, is working like a charm. It's very amusing and with great performances, and you'll be surprised by the conclusion. This Korean film is about family and class division, and no matter how good a plan you have you can't plan for the unexpected. Parasite is the well deserved winner of the Palme d'or at last year's Cannes Film Festival."
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"Mrs. Shullivan and I finally decided to sit down and read (English sub-titles) this 2020 Academy Award Best Picture winner and both of us felt it was decent enough, but to win ""Best Picture"" against a great film like ""Once Upon a Time In Hollywood"" I think director Quentin Tarantino was absolutely robbed. I guess when the USA is losing a lot of its film credibility with powerhouse producers such as Harvey Weinstein finally being put behind bars and the decades old USA social justice upheavel the Academy felt it was about time to suck up to foreign countries and give the Best Picture to another country to start showing they can be inclusive, so why not send some awards to South Korea?  We heard a lot of good feedback from friends and family about Parasite, and I would agree that the first half was decent enough, but the latter half I felt I was watching a cheap version of a Bruce Lee action film.  I really enjoyed the cinematography, and the set designs were eloquent, but the story failed to impress me and the character development literally fizzled, sort of like when in the 1939 Wizard Of Oz, the wicked witch of the west melted when water was thrown upon her. I cannot honestly say this was a memorable film, certainly not Academy Award Best Picture worthy, and I would not recommend this film as a ""must see"" such as the 2019 One Upon a Time In Hollywood is a must see at least three times.  I give Parasite a decent but no higher IMDB rating then 6 out of 10."
기생충,Parasite,2019,2,,I really don't understand how this has such high ratings. I really tried to like it but fell asleep less than halfway through.
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"Parasite is an exceptional, innovative and unforgettable movie in expression and form. Movie music is quite fit and suitable in every scene. It elaborates the dark side of social disparity masterfully. I have not seen such an intense and impressive movie for a long time."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,This movie shows exactly how it is to live in a country full of structural violence. It shows perfectly the desperation of people in need to have a better life.
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"This movie starts off with a seemingly predictable start, a poor kid pretends to be a college student in order to be an English tutor for a rich girl. But what unravels is an extraordinary story of power, greed, insanity, manipulation, and false appearances. It's a slow rise to disconcerting, uncomfortable, and then all of the sudden, it is disturbing and gory and... insane.  There is no way to see what's coming next, I promise you that. Now that's a real thriller.  Highly recommend. The ending leaves questions unanswered, but many opportunities to philosophize on humanity and class."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Parasite is one of those movies were you can sit down and let it surprise you. The script reminds me of Billy Wilder. It switches from comedy to drama because life is like that. The directing is flawless, Acting is compelling. But the most important thing is how it illustrates the sad society we've come to create in the XXI century, with no social mobility. It is fatalistic because bettering yourself nowadays is practically impossible.  This film must be seen by anyone who loves movies. It is one that will stand the test of time. Hollywood be worried with your generic formulas, Korea is the new power house and Parasite is the culminations of years of doing things right. American audiences should read subtitles for once. This movie will make you laugh and cry. The story falls into place like this perfect unpredictable puzzle. It's a must watch. A masterpiece."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"I predict a strong hard campaign to make this South Korean movie become a hype until to get its deserved Oscar. The allegory is pretty awesome. I recommend to get a blindly watch, because this could be very useful. I'm gonna pay attention more on next Joon-ho Bong's projects."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"I am going to be unpopular here because it's unfashionable to do anything other than laud Parasite from the rooftops.  Let's get a couple of things straight before the off.  I have no issue with the 'One inch barriers"" to universal film appreciation that director Bong Joon Ho describes subtitles as. I have seen thousands of subtitled movies and Scandi Noirs.  I have no, unlike Mr Trump, political bias against (sorry, not bias, prejudice in Trump's case) South Korean cinema. Indeed I recently reviewed Chan Wook-Park's The Handmaiden as 10 stars on IMDB. (Oldboy is a classic from Park, too.)  I also loved Ho's Okja and The Host, although I thought his English-speaking Snowpiercer was truly awful.  So this is not the problem, and just because I'm not raving about this doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it, I did. I just feel the praise that's being lavished upon it is greater than my appreciation.  I read one review on IMDB by 'mysticfall' that suggested anyone who didn't love this was a moron and clearly didn't understand it.  I had no issue with understanding it.  It's essentially a movie about class and privilege in which Ho brings together South Korea's richest and poorest in one household, with the poorest as servants, and sets up a scenario where he does not judge either for their caste.  Except he does.  As the film progresses it's clear that the master of the house has an ingrained prejudice against the poor that manifests itself in his inability to understand or articulate that it's their 'smell' that reeks of poverty, and is therefore undesirable.  Variously described as a comedy and horror it leans far more to the former with some extremely funny lines and a pretty strong dose of slapstick - as seen in Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton's excellent Inside Number 9 episode - A Quiet Night In in which two cat-burglars attempt to steal paintings from an occupied house without a word of dialogue.  Almost all of Act 2 of Parasite was essentially this episode.  The horror that we are promised is actually gore, and is reserved for Act 3. It's very much in the school of Tarantino, and, of course, Tarantino himself is heavily influenced by Asian film-making, so a certain circle is squared.  The performances are universally excellent but I feel that, on occasion, Ho strays into slightly heavy-handed territory - much in evidence in his direction of Snowpiercer. It's not enough to spoil anything, but it clashes with the adulatory reviews I've read.  The cinematography is simply beautiful.  It's a fine movie, but in my view 1917 was a more immersive cinematic experience and consequently deserved the Best Picture Academy Award.  Call me what you like, but I'm saying what I'm seeing."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I am more than delighted to say that this twisted dark comedy from South Korea more than lives up to the hype. It was the recipient of the Palm D'Or this year at Cannes and has received universally ecstatic reviews. It's an absolute masterpiece, and one of the best films of the past ten years.  I won't say too much about the plot to avoid giving anything away, but the film tells the story of a poor family of con artists in South Korea who begin to start being employed by a gullible, extremely wealthy family. The narrative manages to effortlessly and seamlessly combine astounding entertainment with efficacious and impactful social commentary. The film is loaded with substantial messages about class divides not only in South Korean society, but also in the world as a whole. From there, its main raison d'être expands to the analysis of how we can respond to such divides when placed in extreme situations. The results are shocking, startling, hilarious, and utterly brilliant. Such results certainly couldn't be achieved without a truly outstanding cast, but lucky for us, Bong Joon-ho has assembled an astonishing ensemble. Even more impressive is the film's character development. While the film's primary characters are often not the most ethical, they are surprisingly likable and multi-dimensional--especially when heightened by both emotion and tone. You'll certainly remember them long after the credits roll.  But what's most unforgettable about ""Parasite"" is that the film manipulates (in the best way possible) its tone in so many unique and engaging ways, that it is able to fully subvert the viewer's expectations of not only how the film will go, but how tone in a film of any kind can be executed under normative conditions. Combining laugh-out-loud, witty comedy, taut suspense, and moments of pitch-black darkness, viewers will be fully immersed in one of the most unpredictable narratives put on film of the past twenty years. While such tonal shifts may sound erratic, they could not have been done more perfectly here--so much so that the film ultimately feels like an unprecedented crescendo in its tone--especially given that the tonal shifts are made more impactful by the film's almost impeccable tightness, not wasting a single frame to keep the viewer fully and utmost engaged.  One review cited in the film's trailer calls ""Parasite"" a ""magic trick."" I couldn't agree more, both literally and figuratively. A definite 10/10."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,GOOD movie but itS not amazing This movie is overrated
기생충,Parasite,2019,3,,"I'm really amazed under which category this film lies. Comedy? It is not funny at all. Tragedy ? I don't know!!! Four Oscars and Palm d'or !!!! Are you serious. I can't say that I know better than the people who awarded the film these prizes, I'm sure the problem is me, there is something hidden deep in this movie I couldn't see."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"This is , no doubt, modern masterpiece. Talent, imagination, wisdom, combined with actual theme make this one of the best movies in the 21-st century. Go and see it!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Just wanted to register my ""10"" for this movie. I'm late with this review and have nothing to add to the many other reviews previously posted."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Parasite stands atop the rest of the competition as the best film of 2019. Director Bong Joon-ho delivers his masterpiece, a film that has you hooked from the very beginning. Over the course of Parasite's runtime, it draws you deeper and deeper into its world, demanding more and more of your attention. Just when your investment in the characters peaks, Bong Joon-ho takes Parasite off the rails and delivers a striking message on the innate struggles between classes. Add in fantastic performances and cinematography, and you have the must-see film of 2019."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"You have to watch it for yourself to appreciate the story telling and cinematography. I'm a superhero, dumb action flicks type of person but once in a while I can appreciate a good film and this is it."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,My favorite foreign language film and definitely my top 20 if not top 10 favorite film of all time One of the most amazing story telling I have ever seen in a movie
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Parasite is a modern day masterpiece even though it's not one of my favorite films nor is it my favorite film of the year. I have one tiny issue with the film but it is more of a nitpick. The film's message is a little on the nose but I don't have a huge issue with it but it is noticeable. Other than that, this film is perfect. There is not one bad performance in the movie. Cho Yeo-jeong, Park So-dam, and Kang-Ho Song are standouts from the film. All 3 of them have some of the best acting of the year. Their work with a fantastic script that is incredibly well written and clever makes their performance so much more enjoyable. Another aspect I loved was the cinematography. The film's slow camera movements and slow tracking shots look absolutely beautiful which go along great with the fantastic production design. The film's story and themes make this film incredible. The story of this poor family slowly infiltrating a rich family only to find out that their house is not what it seems. It's so incredibly tense. You never know what is going to happen next and it's always surprising to see what eventually happens. The film has themes of class divide and class warfare throughout which are very profound. The rich family says these lines about how great their life is while the opposite is happening to the poor family. Every time this occurs, you see how the poor family reacts and makes the scene and film itself dramatically more tense. Another thing I liked about the film was the score by Jung Jaeil. His score adds so much more to the tension. I know I'm using the word tension a lot but that's what this film is. A constant build up of tension scene by scene until it all culminates in the finale. For me, each passing scene left me more and more on the edge of my seat. One final aspect I want to touch on is the humor. Most of the jokes are cleverly written and while some of the jokes may not be that funny, I do appreciate how they were cleverly inserted instead of incredibly forced. Except this film to be on a bunch of Top 10 lists at the end of the year. Overall, Parasite is a fantastic film with great acting, great cinematography, and a powerful story about class divide even if its message may be a little too on the nose."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"Disturbingly good. Even though I don't like the plot and the ending, there are so many messages in the movie. And this is not american fairy tale, so watched it and I realized this movie was not made to entertain myself."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"Directed by Bong Joon-ho. ""Parasite"" follows the members of a poor household (Kim) scheming to become employees of a much wealthier family (Park) by posing as unrelated, highly qualified individuals.  This movie exceeded my expectations. What a way to showcase class struggles and differences between the wealthy and financially lacking in brilliantly done social commentary! This movie feels like it's moving at lightning pace because of how effortlessly it flows. There isn't a dull moment to it, you're either on edge or learning more about it's well-defined characters. Each is distinct and so well performed. I recognized Korean-Canadian actor Woo-sik Choi from ""Train to Busan"" (he's looking fine in this too btw XD) as the brother Ki-Woo. I may be biased because I've grown to really like seeing him, but he was my favorite character in this film. I see him as the main character since he really starts the film with a conversation and ends it with a monologue to his father. Really well done, applause to you sir!  I loved seeing the scheming involved in this, with a name like ""Parasite"" I thought this was going to be sci-fi in nature. But it's not at all! It's more of a home invasion film where the rich owners willingly allow these people to come into their lives. The Kim family were some sneaky ba****** let me tell you and I loved it! It's like a better version of Ocean's films (sorry fans of that series), but with less heisting and more actual manual labour. But still a lot of deception, showing class division without making the rich too ""villain-like"". So seeing as the story/screenplay was superb, it's of course coupled with great camerawork/visual representations and an on-point soundtrack to back it up. There's some amazing parallel driven scenes that involve flooding that show that you don't have to treat an audience like they need to be spoon-fed information. Which I appreciate a lot! I'm so glad this film had a U.S. release because not having people over here see it because of subtitles...that would be tragic! I want more foreign films released in theatres over here to be honest!  This by far is one of the best films of 2019. It's thrilling, funny, tragic and very very intelligent. Please watch it if you haven't! I'm definitely going to have to check out more from the director/co-writer because he's impressed me highly and clearly is a master at his own craft. I love Asian cinema and foreign films in general, this is exactly why. You miss out on so much greatness if you stick to only ""your language"" while watching films. Don't be one of those people! I'm going to have to watch the movie a few more times to really pick up on everything. Also final side-note, the poster for this film is genius. You'll know what I mean once you've watched it."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"This movie is nice and the idea is interesting, but it's not the best movie of 2019, it's totally overrated."
기생충,Parasite,2019,4,,Sometimes I really believe people are high when them watch specific kind of movies in festivals.
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Don't read another review. Don't watch a trailer. As soon as you get the next opportunity, watch this film. That's all."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"There are no flaws. It has transcended film itself. It's funny, scary, sad, and gripping from start to finish. As one critic put it, ""It's a magic trick.""  I don't care if you ""can't take subtitles,"" or whatever. I can easily recommend this film to anybody. Please watch it and support foreign, arthouse, and indie cinema. But I implore you: go in blind.  And I'm hoping for a Best Picture win at the Oscars.  Bong Joon-ho's masterpiece."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"The Academy Awards are in 5 days and Parasite is nominated for 6 Oscars, including best picture. I thought that the most simple comparison to make is between this and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Both films are entertaining throughout the entire run-time, but really blast off in a bizarre fashion in the final minutes. Parasite is at its best when it uses haunting imagery and compelling character relationships to drive the plot forward. This is one to root for at the awards."
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"Just saw Parasite for the first time with subtitles. For a foreign film from Korea, this is very accessible for all languages and audiences. The actors are all expressive, attractive, and do a really good job acting. The story has lots of universal, contemporary components to it of pop culture.  For what it's worth, the best way to describe this movie would be by calling it something like South Korea's ""City of God"", or something along those lines; what you have here is an impressive foreign film that is stylishly directed, well-written, and pretty gritty.  It starts out as a fun and enjoyable dark comedy, which slowly dwindles down during the second half when it becomes part thriller, part mystery (without giving away spoilers).  I wanted to give this movie the full 10 rating, but unfortunately I just could not. Sorry, but I had to question the ease at which the events unfolded, and that's not to say that it wasn't fun and perhaps it had to be that way to make the movie work, but there was slightly just enough questions to take it out of the ""perfect"" range of storytelling. The same issue also arose in the second, back half of the movie- some of the events that unfolded towards the end also raised some questions which cause it to not be a perfect 10.  However, other than these two (fairly big- big enough to deduct two points) flaws, the script is practically perfect, especially for a foreign film. The writers and director did a nice job of developing the story and added just enough layers to captivate, immerse, and challenge your mind, while also keeping it entertaining. They added just enough style to differentiate it and make it stand out as something thoughtful and creatively made.  I was hoping this would win me over for a Best Picture Oscar upset contender, but unfortunately, it just didn't quite prove enough to me to have confidence in that possibility. It could still happen, but after viewing it with an open mind, it looks like it's between Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and 1917.  EDIT: Slept on it and decided I would still pick this over 1917 because at least it had a script with some meat."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,Clever idea but ended up being farcical. Excellent acting and original plot however how it ended up into a murder spree is where it was let down.
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Perfectly told story with perfectly logical plots and motives for every character, justification for every frame and accompanied by a thought-provoking message that lingers long after you leave the theatre. Surely one of the best of cinema."
기생충,Parasite,2019,3,,"Once again the Academy Awards get it wrong. Awards for film are meaningless and superficial. I've never been a fan of the art house genre. However, I do appreciate the films of David Lynch, and I believe he's the only one that has turned art house into a fine art form. I bet five dollars that the six hour long sequel to this film never sees the light of day at HBO. It's too soon after the disaster that was GoT. Parasite was too slick and packaged for mainstream consumption. Much like the human branding it so desperately tried to spotlight. I could think of a hundred foreign films the Academy passed over for Best Picture for some American made drivel. This film was not one of them. Down with all awards shows!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,The movie is delivered so artistically while being interesting the whole way through. The hole the characters dig themselves into get deeper exponentially and you're completely on edge the last twenty minutes. Immediately after the movie I was shook to the core. Afterwards I had to do a lot of thinking to fully process what I just watched and understand the social messages. Amazing movie and I know for sure this is not going to get the attention it deserves because it is a Korean film.
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Bong Joon-Ho is a director that I'll definitely check out more. I loved Snowpiercer but have left to see the rest of his Korean films which have been unanimously praised by everyone. Parasite is nothing short of genius.  It's best to go in not knowing anything about the movie as that makes the experience all the more enjoyable but what I can say is that Parasite combines many different genres at once which is executed in the best way possible. This film will take you on a rollercoaster of emotions. There are some extremely funny moments then there are moments of tragedy and despair and then there are times which are incredibly intense yet none of it feels inconsistent. Bong Joon-Ho managed to find the perfect blend of funny and serious tones whilst making the film feel as smooth as possible.  The story of Parasite is extremely well thought and manages to stay subtle throughout its entirety. Bong Joon-Ho crafted characters that are really clever and interesting to watch. Their motivations and state make them believable to the audience. The events that unfold don't come across as unrealistic but rather plausible due to the excellent writing.  Aside from the story, this is one of the most beautiful films of 2019. The colours and lighting are really well utilised making the cinematography look downright gorgeous. There is one scene involving a lot of water which looks fantastic. The editing is fantastic as the film's pacing is quite fast so there is no dull moment whatsoever. The aesthetics on the whole is top notch.  I thought Knives Out had a stellar cast but the ensemble cast of Parasite is extraordinary. Everyone did a phenomenal job playing their roles.  I really tried to think of flaws but as of now I could not find any. Everything is addressed properly and what takes place all makes sense. Whilst delivering a fun film, there are some great themes and messages this film explores and Bong Joon-Ho sheds light on them visually rather than using exposition which I commend. I love how he respects the audience by not thinking they're dumb.  2019 has been one of the best years for film and Parasite is one of the best without a doubt. A lot of people have already seen this movie but if you haven't then go watch it immediately. This is a film you should not miss."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"PROS:  EVERY SINGLE THING.  The acting is great. The pacing is amazing, it always feels like something is happening and you won't get bored. The message isn't scream out at the audience, you need to read between the lines. The characters are well developed, there's no hero or villain. You can empathize with every character and understand why they do what they do. There are violence, comedy, action, suspense and romance. Honestly, I wasn't expecting much, and I find myself really.  CONS:  Not for me, but some people may find the ending really weird and unsatisfying. But read some reviews and probably you would understand what's the message behind the ending."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"First and foremost, this movie is a must watch! It starts funny, becomes interesting, and then holy ****! The writing, directing, cinematography, and acting are all masterclass. To sum this movie in a few words I would say it's a dark comedy tragedy(if such a thing exists). Also, if you see this movie and want more check out the director's other movies that are also great; Snowpiercer, Mother, and Okja. Most of his movies, including Parasite, are about the classes we fall under and even though we may be from the same country, same race, whatever, we still see each other so differently because of this."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,Great movie! I didn't expect that. I actually just watch it because it was nominated to the oscars but ended really enjoying it. It's definitely going to win best foreign movie
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I really love the way they mixed thriller and comedy, when it got serious it got really serious, when it was funny u would laugh your ass off. Definitely one of the greatest films ever made. I really didn't want it to end, but all good things must come to an end"
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"So maybe I'm an uncultured swine or maybe some of the effect was lost in translation... but whatever it may be, I'm not sure I understand the hype around this movie.  Don't get me wrong, it was good... but it wasn't all that. To be honest I thought it was just above average. I think I may have liked it more if it was a bit more concise. The almost two hour long run time made it feel drawn out especially for nothing super intriguing taking place. There were definitely solid moments throughout, good acting and a general level of engagement, it just didn't super draw me in.  I think if I had watched this without being privy to any of the hype I might have liked it more, but I guess I was just slightly disappointed. Regardless, this is for sure a fun and thrilling movie that I would still recommend."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"This film deals with the genre freely. The director's originality, completeness, artistry, and popularity were well harmonized."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"This movie is a vastly overrated film, but still had some cool moments. It just starts off very slow and the first hour is interesting but does drag on after a bit. The story is good, but it just goes on and on without any real purpose. It doesn't really go anywhere until the mid point, which has a really cool twist and you feel like the movie will bring up the topic of debt, but it just sort of stops. Then suddenly the final 20 minutes becomes Friday the 13th.  The biggest issue is that you never feel for the main characters. They have no backstory. They are poor, and nothing else. They can't even fold pizza boxes yet still complain when the owner takes off 10% from them. They are kinda unlikable and are pretty much scammers. They cost people their jobs by lying and we are supposed to feel bad for them? They go into people's house and stay there while the people go on trips. You just don't feel for them, and at the end they try to have this big emotional revelation but it completely fails. Why would we feel bad for a bunch of poor scammer who end up being murderers?  In the end it had some cool and intense scenes, a hot sex scene, some cool violent scenes, but it is not a masterpiece. The story really goes nowhere and in the end it just ends up exactly where it started. SNOWPIERCER is a masterpiece! Go watch that instead.  7/10"
기생충,Parasite,2019,3,,"The movie itself starts fine. The pace is interesting and such, until that... It basically doesn't has too much to offer. It has some suspense and some insane plot twists, but that's basically it and I don't understand all the hype revolving this film."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,One of the best Drama-Thriller movie I have seen in years. Plot is fresh as ever. Cinemetography and character developement is at its best. Want to see more movies from Sir Bong Joon-ho.
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I absolutely loved this film!, the best of the year by far in my opinion. Everything was masterclass, the acting, directing, writing, tech aspects. lol in my top 100 for sure."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,Extreme! Definitely one of the best films I have ever seen. It's a good criticism about the rich and poor in the world.. the movie is really interesting and pretty sad... worth it. Please watch it. You will not regret it.
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,Everything about this film is simply perfect. Absolutely perfect encapsulation of the stunning creativity and capabilities found within South Korean cinema as of the last couple of decades.
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I want to say so much about this powerful movie but it is clear from the scores and reviews it is compelling, thought-provoking and subtly absorbing.  Suffice to say it's a must watch for anyone who is intreagued by the class decides and struggles of society perfectly framed in a culture of academically hungry people.  This beautiful movie crosses many genres and does a fantabulous job of letting you be thoroughly taken into the lives of each character without any judgement to their respective plights.  I am left with a silent revilaey that hard work can be a poisoned chalis if it has no real meaning, as much as luck and wealth can leave you unfulfilled if you don't look down with compassion.  Or was it all just a metaphor? If so, what for? I, for one, don't care."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"Parasite is a South Korean Movie directed by Joon Ho Bong, who also directed Snowpiercer, Okja, and most brilliantly Mother. Now this movie probably has more twists and turns than any of his other films, which is saying a lot.  You never know where the story is headed so there's a lot of suspense throughout the film. At first, you're given a glimpse into the lives of a family living in wretched poverty. Their wifi doesn't work, their basement dwelling gets flooded, and worst of all the local drunk pisses right outside their door. Perhaps this is what makes the family turn into a band of scam artists. That's actually one of the things that bothers me about the film. All of the family members are fully integrated in the criminal activities without any second thoughts about how it will affect the victims. I wanted to see more fleshed out characters who question each other and themselves. I wanted there to be a reason for their turning out the way they did. Poverty isn't enough.  Even so, the cataclysmic turn of events is more than enough to keep you engaged. The conniving planning that goes into their schemes keeps you entertained for the first hour. After that a curveball is thrown at them, as well as us, the audience.  And again more characters are shown to be treacherous without any explanation as to how they arrived to have that mindset. I'm sorry to point this out again, but it gets irksome. I expected more from the director of the masterpiece, Mother. That is a film that kept me engaged because the characters had motives, even though those motives were somewhat ambiguous. Despite all my criticisms, Parasite is a suspenseful thriller with plenty of content to keep you enthralled for its entirety."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,This film will take you throw comedy and sad and madness times...its just a good one that any one can see all of it on the edge of his chair...the movie has a great story with unexpacted events....from the best in this yeare 2019
기생충,Parasite,2019,,,"Looks great, smells bad. That's the overall message and reality of this movie. After so much hype and high reviews, it's amazing to see that the whole thing could have been avoided if : a) dude didn't smell, b) dude didn't say that dude smelled or c) dude didn't hear that dude said he smelled. If that's all it takes to radically change your film then you need to do a rewrite. It's not about class, or social blah blah, or injustice or wealth or yada yada yada, it's about smell and this movie is a stinker. Ca pue!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,I could not quite grasp the idea of the movie because of the inconsistent characters. Very intelligent and resourceful Kim family living in the extreme poverty seems the weak point of the script. Unfolding of the events push the credibility of the movie to the level of cartoons watched by the kids. Watchable but not an Oscar movie in my opinion.
기생충,Parasite,2019,5,,"I didn't think this film was particular good it's not as smart as it thinks it is, the infiltration of the house was unrealistic and the so called twist was predictable. The oscars have no credibility these days."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"This film is a powerful parable. If you like straightforward Hollywood films - with good guys and bed guys and an obviously predictable plot - DON'T see this film. It will leave you confused, even annoyed. If, on the other hand, you want to see a film that will make you think and reevaluate your view on modern human society, it is a must see for you."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"This film is really good and makes you think deeply about the situations it shows. The duality between the protagonist family and the rich Park's is shown in such a wonderful, realistic manner. This type of storytelling has been long missing and I hope more movie makers follow in this trend - in their own original way of course.  My one complaint was that the film is slow in some middle parts; some scenes last longer than they should. This could be a cultural difference in film-making, as another South Korean film I watched had these instances as well. Still, it's not enough for me to completely give up on it. It's a proper thriller, American films have tried to pull this off throughout the whole of last decade, but failed (with the exception of ""Get Out."") You laugh, you're sent to the edge of your seat, you get angry, and finally you feel sad. You know a movie is great when it's able to awaken so many emotions and leave you talking about different interpretations of the film long after you've watched it.  I'm glad South Korean films are getting the attention they deserve. I've watched other South Korean films in the past and they are excellent storytellers. Congratulations to everyone involved with this film, you all did an amazing job and I'm happy your hard work has been recognized on an international level.  Highly recommend this film and if you're avoiding it due to subtitles or the non-sensible bad reviews, you're sorely missing out."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"This movie is easily the best of the year in the entire world. The legendary director Bong joon-ho known for his movies (memories of murder, the host, snowpeircer, okja) churns out yet another masterpiece "" parasites"". The movie completely engages you through its brilliant storytelling. The comedy , humour, suspense , thrill and drama elements keeps you hooked into the screen. The peformance of all the actors are top notch. The flim is a visual treat filled with lot of suprising moments. Its very rare to see such kind of story telling on the screen kudos to the director bong joon ho and his team for experimenting with such theme. The movie is by far the best in its genre and will be remembered as a classic. It wont be wrong to say that this movie is definitely among the finest movies made in this decade."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"This movie has it all. Great script, outstanding acting, the drama, the comedy, the thrill, the cinematography and an amazing director. Incredible movie."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"This is a very rich film ""with metaphors"" as the young hero of it might say. It is very compeling viewing from its first minute as the direction, writing and acting are very cleverly done. The themes of the have-nots against the haves and the cold-hearted versus the warmer-hearted people dominate the plot, which is thick. There is a lot of symbolism in it. Who are the real parasites, anyway: the poor or the wealthy, the caring or the indifferent? The tone takes a turn three-quarters of the way through from French-farce style to almost a horror film. However, it is worth engaging in until its conclusion, as it has some serious messages for the viewers and is a very wise work indeed. I can see why it won the Palme d'Or at Cannes in 2019; it's a gem."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"Parasite landed with a massive splash in 2019, Bong Joon-ho's satirical black comedy is excruciatingly tense and a fantastic confection. Its bracing cynicism makes it drop slightly short of being a clarion call to revolution and it has a few too many endings for me but the unpeeling of this particular onion is tremendously fun. It's easy to see why it did as well as it did."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Bong Joon-ho seems to be incapable of making a bad film and this one might be his very best. Parasite is wickedly funny, stunningly tragic, and just gorgeously constructed from beginning to end.  The visual storytelling here is immaculate, the stair sequence, in particular, is incredibly crafted.The sound design and soundtrack are superbc subtle and strong in all the right places.This is probably the best-paced film I've seen this year, there's virtually nothing I could think of to trim.  I am deliberately avoiding talking about the film in more specific terms, you don't need me for plot summary there's plenty of that online already. Though I would suggest avoiding all of it if you really want to get as much out of this film as possible. Family is certainly a strong theme as is class struggle if that helps.  The acting is all excellent. Song Kang-ho continues to be one of the best actors working today. The dude will have you cracking up and then choking up within minutes of each other.  I'm not really able to talk about this film at length without spoiling it so I'll just say if you're a true fan of film, this is not one you can miss. This is the type of movie that reminds people why they love film in the first place.  10/10 First a trickle, then a flood"
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"A movie that not only highlights the difference between the upper economy class and the lower economy class but also wraps around the emotions associated when two classes meet at some point.  If you are looking to watch something that's realistic, including drama, story, and emotions, PARASITE is one such movie. No spoilers, but it will leave a lasting impact in recognizing the everyday struggle of the earning member belonging to a lower middle class and how he has to go through tons of emotions hiding the pain from his family members.  While also, how such people aspire to become similar to the ones they are working for."
기생충,Parasite,2019,5,,"Parasite is itself a parasite of a movie. The start is interesting and the cinematography is excellent throughout the film. It's a lot of fun seeing the street life of this poor family and their living conditions. There are some very unlikely manuplations involving job positions which are all too quickly accomplished and never entirely believable in their successful execution. What kills this film is the ridiculous second half of the movie and ending. This is It makes you wonder if they had a new writer finish the story up. One who just wanted to create an ending and had no concept of how to do it. Because there was some good acting and great film work, I gave it five stars. But it probably rates less due to bizaare and impossibly stupid parts to the movie."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"I didn't know what to expect from Parasite. After a few minutes, I found myself with the same feeling in my gut as the first time I saw Rocky. I was really rooting for this impoverished but street smart, underdog of a family. The story moved forward and I found myself not sure of how I felt about them and their charade. The acting and directing are tremendous! The pace of the film leaves you suspended in anxiety. But what an incredible film it is. Without question one of the best films I've seen in the last five years. Certainly the sleeper film for the Academy Award. Excellent, 9/10."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Man, where do I even begin? Let's start with the technical aspects. It is shot very well, the production design is so good that I couldn't tell what was real and what wasn't, the acting is phenomenal (especially from Joon Ho favorite Kang-Ho Song), and the score is the best of the year so far.  And now for the story. Just wow. The script tackles so many complicated themes about society and class flawlessly, and it developes all of the characters perfectly. There are about 8 main characters, and they all feel like actual people and not objects for the story. The situation that the characters get in is very interesting and thrilling. This is the best film of the year, and one of the best ever. Just watch it."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Midway through the brilliant and deeply unsettling ""Parasite,"" a destitute man voices empathy for a family that has shown him none."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I had a very high expectation for ""Parasite"", I believed the hype and I was right! 'Parasite' is what we can call a high level motion Picture in terms of everything. The story itself is funny, intense, terrific and dramatic at the same Time. You go through a lot of emotion, from an enormous laughter to an enormous sadness, to compassion and suspense. It shows not only a society problem but also a suggestion of solution. More, the film is perfectly directed, written and shot, to make you intro it easily. The unanimous Palme d'Or is 100% deserved. See it by yourself, believe the hype, and you'll never want it to finish. Congratulations Bong!"

기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"On one side is the flooded cottage, and on the other side is the birthday party. On one side is the cold and hard gym, and on the other is the luxurious and soft backyard. Money is an iron that irons everything flat. They scrape the internet, live in the basement, and do anything for a job. When you think they are already miserable enough, the movie suddenly turns around: they are not the worst yet, there are even worse ones. If you are rich, there must be someone richer than you; If you are poor, there must be someone even poorer than you. The wealth gap is like countless walls, dividing people into different classes. This wall stands tall even in the wind, sun, and rain, without moving a trace. The Park couple may seem foolish, but they are still getting richer and richer; The Jin Jize family is incredibly intelligent, but they still can't turn around. You think finding a good job with a good salary can lift you out of poverty, but in fact, it's still a thousand miles away. You can wash away the sweat smell from your clothes, but you cannot wash away the smell of the basement that has already merged into your blood. You have climbed ten or twenty floors, and may have just arrived at someone else's basement. They are insects, so their lives are difficult; They are insects, so nothing can kill them."

기생충,Parasite,2019,1,,"I'm sorry, am I missing something here? Every celebrity, message board poster and even the former President of the United States Obama are saying this was the best movie of the year.  It's just not good! Why is this being considered one of the best of the year? I'm totally lost. This is one of the most forgettable movies I have ever seen. To put it bluntly, even Michael Bay's worst Transformers movie is better than this dreck.  I came into this movie thinking it was going to be the next City of God based on the hype. It's actually on the level of a movie on Netflix that I'd spend five minutes on before skipping to the next film and clicking ""thumbs down.""  Don't waste your time, trust me on this.  I forgot to add, it's very obvious that whoever made this movie ripped off Shameless in many ways. They were definitely inspired by it."

What is your emotional response to this movie? All over the place.  What did this movie make me feel? Happy.  What moments, character, or ideas resonated with me while watching this movie? A lot!

기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"When I heard about Parasite, I heard about the overwhelming praise first. Normally when a movie gets a 99% on RT i end up liking them but I never rave about them (Boyhood and Get Out are prime examples). So i went into Parasite with caution. But i was wrong. It really is THAT good. Not ""good"" its Excellent. Brilliant. Genius. I could go on and on. From the masterful direction to the cinematography and production design, the acting, the script; its all perfect. I don't want to give away anything because if you go in completely blind, you'll walk away with the best film of the year worming through your brain."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"You will not get bored, you will enjoy most of it, but it does not get that level of a masterpiece!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I don't usually give 10 points, but the film impressed me. (It's been a month since I'm still in effect.) The way he describes events and emotions is very interesting. I follow South Korean films as much as possible. I have not seen this kind of narration either in South Korean cinema or in other countries. I would really recommend to anyone interested in cinema and looking for new things. bong joon ho is an excellent director. Every job is getting better and better."
기생충,Parasite,2019,3,,"Really, one of the worst, most drawn out films I've ever seen. The people touting it as a 10 are pseudo-intellectuals trying to construct something that just wasn't there - like the amateur critics on here who think of themselves as legit film critics. I'm sorry, the film just doesn't deserve the hype or accolades, and most certainly not the Academy Award (even for foreign language film, let alone Best Film).  I was expecting something deeply profound and artistic, and this just wasn't either of those things. This is a horrible example of trying to expand one's cinematic palate to foreign films, because there are wonderful foreign films out there. I'm guessing the people that liked this also thought ""Mother"" was some sort of mind blowing masterpiece."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Incredible film making, acting and story. Really transported me."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Absolutely breathtaking, easily one of the best movies of this year!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,Stunning screenplay and wonderful acting by the whole team members. Director took the story to the next leave of film. The ending and the start of the story is obviously awesome. Thanks I enjoyed this Movie and loved it . The best Korean Film I have ever watched in this decade.
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"I love this movie! At first, I wasn't sold and then it got into this pace and doesn't slow down. Watch this movie!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,I wouldn't say anything bad about this movie because I can't!
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"SYNOPSIS: A poor family in South Korea con their way into the home of the wealthy. They soon find themselves in the middle of a dark, unexpected secret.  REVIEW: This film is truly an original masterpiece. From Bong Joon Ho's direction to all of the phenomenal acting. So intricate and precise it left a really special film. POSITIVES: As I mentioned, the directing is absolutely superb. Bong Joon Ho really has this immersive directing style that get you to lose yourself within the film. You feel as though your living through what the characters are living through. The acting is Oscar worthy all around. Kang-ho Song, Sun-kyun Lee, Yeo-jeong Jo, Woo-sik Choi, So-dam Park and everyone else had unbelievable chemistry together. The big stand outs to me were definitely Kang-ho and Yeo-jeong. I feel those were the two captains of storytelling for their respective families and it was nothing short of amazing. Whether it was the build up for Kim Ki-taek (Kang-ho Song) to what ultimate happens in the end or the absolute unwarranted trust and obliviousness of Park Yeon-kyo (Yeo-jeong Jo). You really get a feel of the difference in class and how a family struggles through poverty in order to make a life for themselves and how the rich use their money to mask their own ignorance. NEGATIVES: Its tough for me to come up with any negatives. This is one of those films where I don't see very much wrong at all, however, it's a film I couldn't see myself rewatching more than twice. Not that it's a bad film or too heavy subject matter, it's just not one of those films I gravitate towards for multiple viewings and that's why I don't have it as a perfect 10/10. CONCLUSION: This is one of those films I definitely encourage everyone to see at least once. It's so original and so well told that I know this is a film people will go back to and talk about the significance this film has on cinema. It will be taught in classes and will be a timeless film. Superb all around from cinematography to editing. This is a great film to get those opposed to foreign films on the boat. 8.9/10."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,Never enjoyed and kept my eyes glued to a movie for quite some time. Enjoyably thrilling.
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"I was looking forward to Parasite because of the very high rating and the 4 Oscars. Maybe my expectations have been too high for that reason. Anyways, someone has to explain, what on earth is so awesome in it. There is 1 Oscar for the story which is like: a clever poor family deceives a naive rich family.  But I can name hundreds of movies that haven't even been nominated in that category before, with a better story.  The actors do a good job. It is watchable to kill time. Yes. Some scenes are fun. Yes. Some people claim it is one of the best movies of the decade. Really? For sure, it is NOT one of the best of the decade. It's not a bad movie by any means, just overrated."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,I'm on an Oscar binge right now. And WOW this movie suprised me. Not a huge fan or foreign films and having to read a lot of the subtitles but I couldn't miss this with all the hype around it. Such a crazy thriller and a lot of funny moments with it as well. Not gonna give anything away because I feel everyone who sees this should go in it blind. By far one of the best movies of the year.
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I would describe it as a modern tragicomedy that portrays the drama of social inequality and frustration because of the excessive contrasts between social classes, narrated with black humor, paradoxes and a hint of absurdity.  It is a critique of today's society, focused on having, on the immediate gratification, on the excesses for only a few people while we close our eyes to the inequality and poverty of many.  Its well deserved, the film won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes festival and the critic describes it as ""perfection made film"".  P.S. The house is a dream of architecture."
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"When it comes to foreign films I tend to be a little biased or lenient. They are such a welcome break from traditional Hollywood. When I see a decent foreign film I can't help but want to praise it more because they don't have the multi-billion dollar Hollywood machine behind them. Usually, they have to be more creative, more ingenious, and more resourceful.  ""Parasite"" is one of very few Korean films I've watched in my life. My foreign film bank consists mostly of Chinese kung-fu movies of which Jackie Chan and Jet Li probably occupy the most space. Korean films are a rarity for me. This suspenseful thriller by Bong Joon-Ho deserves all of the accolades it has received.  What I knew about it going in was that a poor family had moved in on a wealthy family to take advantage of them. That is essentially what happened, but you're not holding anyone's attention with that concept alone. Each character in this film had something to offer and was watchable. As the movie developed and we saw the Kim family sinking its teeth deeper into the Park family, we were treated with wonderful dialogue and a crafty script.  How do you make a movie in which none of the characters are antagonists and none are really protagonists either? Some how ""Parasite"" did that. The Kim family certainly was shady and underhanded, but they could be viewed as a poor family just trying to get ahead. The Park family was wealthy, yet unlike your average rich movie family, they were not cruel or unbearable people. In fact they were very likeable.  Normally, we want our clear-cut good guys and bad guys. We want our good guys to win and our bad guys to lose. In the cases where all of our guys are good, we want them all to win. In the cases where all our guys are bad, we want them all to lose. In ""Parasite"" not everyone is distinctly good or bad and there are really no winners."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"High-quality toy tent which does not get wet with rain, and odd contrast of furniture which does not get wet by rain"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"This movie, starting as a clever comedy turns into a deep drama in a modern context of social inequities. This movie undelines how social classes remain splitted in today's world (almost as spltited as in Gosford Park). It also questions how the poor working class have to struggle against itself to benefit from the little that can runoff from the rich ones. Great actor playing and the right pace in the movie makes it a fantastic experience."
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"It's got attention through a Hollywood Event though it is a good film, quite cleverly done. It's quite violent ending takes you by surprise too. It's not worthy of 5 wins of course but not many people know what Korean films have to offer.  I'm critical that The Farewell did not win anything then again the power of the Bollywood has neither had any proper reginition."
기생충,Parasite,2019,,,This family is so entertaining and real and the story is so so real and engaging and it has such a strong message about status and class!!! I really enjoyed it!!!
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"Fairly well told story of struggles, hardships and fantasies of south korean lower middle class. Draws some pertinent inferences to cruel class differences capitalism creates and flourishes upon. Attention to details and proximity to reality remains comendable for the first couple of hours and then comes the disastrous climax. The irrational, abrupt, unjustified and plot defying actions of the characters in the dramatic last scene will surely spoil the mood. The climax will also reveal grave weaknesses of the plot which cant help leading to an inevitable low key ending."
기생충,Parasite,2019,1,,"Worst movie by far I have ever watched. Plot is absolute crap, predictable and boring. How did this even got nominated...? How was this even released!??? I want to believe that all the people that voted 10 was only because it has won an Oscar and they blindly follow whatever gets a prize. Don't waste a single second of your life watching that."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"From the very first frame of Bong Joon-ho's ""Parasite,"" viewers are thrust into a world that feels both familiar and unsettling. This South Korean film cleverly intertwines dark humor, drama, and social commentary, creating a cinematic experience that is as uniquely compelling as it is thought-provoking.  The narrative revolves around the Kim family, who, struggling to make ends meet in their semi-basement home, find themselves devising a cunning plan to infiltrate the lives of the wealthy Park family. What starts as a seemingly straightforward tale of class struggle rapidly morphs into a layered exploration of inequality, privilege, and the lengths one will go to for survival.  Bong's direction is nothing short of genius. He crafts a film that keeps you on the edge of your seat, continuously defying expectations. The cinematography is striking, utilizing the contrasting settings of the Kims' cramped, dilapidated quarters and the Parks' opulent dwelling to symbolize the vast chasm between the two families. Each scene is meticulously framed, capturing the essence of the characters' circumstances and their emotional states.  The performances are sublime, with each actor delivering a nuanced portrayal that adds depth to the narrative. Song Kang-ho as Kim Ki-taek epitomizes desperation and resilience, while Cho Yeo-jeong as Yeon-kyo brings a naive charm to a matriarch unaware of the deception unfolding around her. Their interactions are imbued with a palpable tension, making viewers question the morality of each character's choices.  What truly sets ""Parasite"" apart is its ability to oscillate between genres, seamlessly transitioning from drama to thriller to all-out chaos. It keeps audiences guessing, often eliciting gasps and laughter in equal measure. The film's climax is nothing short of a masterstroke, serving as a sharp indictment of social hierarchy while delivering a chilling reminder of the consequences of unchecked ambition and hunger.  In addition to its gripping narrative, ""Parasite"" leaves viewers with lingering questions about society's structure. It serves as a mirror reflecting the disparities that plague our world, urging us to confront uncomfortable realities. It challenges the audience to identify with both the oppressor and the oppressed, blurring moral lines in a way that is both unsettling and enlightening.  ""Parasite"" is not merely a film; it's a cultural phenomenon that invites dialogue and introspection. It begs the question: How far are we willing to go for success, and what are we willing to sacrifice in the process? This film is a testament to the power of storytelling, proving that cinema can be both entertaining and enlightening.  ""Parasite"" is a bold, original, and expertly crafted film that will resonate with viewers long after the credits roll. It is not just a tale of class struggle; it is a haunting exploration of the human condition, making it a modern classic that deserves every accolade it has received. Don't miss your chance to witness this extraordinary cinematic journey."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"Set in South Korea, Parasite is like a rollercoaster ride through the twisted maze of class divides, where the rich are living it up in their fancy mansions while the rest of us plebs are left scraping by like crumbs on the floor.  The story follows the Kim family, a bunch of scrappy hustlers who manage to wriggle their way into the lives of the wealthy Park family faster than you can say ""social climbing"". It's like watching a game of cat and mouse, except the cats are wearing designer suits and the mice are pulling off the heist of the century.  Now, I won't spoil the plot twists for you, but let's just say things take a turn for the... well, let's just say they take a turn. And it's not pretty. But what is pretty is the way Bong Joon-ho manages to blend dark humor with biting social commentary like a master chef whipping up a gourmet meal."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,This movie only describes how good to be a writer and how good to direct such type of movies. Best movie ever created 2019 I think and by far from the closest chaser.
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,So finally I found a movie to write about and guess what I'm short of a word just Go and watch it it's truly a masterpiece
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I find a lot of korean movies slow and unsatisfying but this one wasn't any of these things, neither did it have that annoying american touch, but this movie will suprise you in ways you would never expect!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,You'll watch knowing you're in the hands of a master filmmaker
기생충,Parasite,2019,,,"Like everywhere else, there are the successful and the not-so. In this film, the bottom dwellers (the Kim family) live in a basement suite and do odd jobs. One day, they use a scam to infiltrate a rich family (the Park family).  In typical Asian manner, the employers don't check job references or do a criminal background check. Depending on personal introductions and a superficial assessment at the job interview. Such is the dependence on the sanctity of Confucian social relationships.  Naturally, the amoral Yi family take full advantage of the naive gentile Mrs. Park. Behaving in an atypical Asian way to eliminate the other servants.  Add the complication of a debtor hiding in a secret basement. Preferring self-imprisonment to life as an outcast above ground.  Eventually, there is tragedy as the past of the deceitful people catch up with them. Bringing death to the Park family.  Excellent direction and acting. Quite convincing.  Like the film Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, this film offers insights into Confucian society. About ideals and the failures to meet the standards."
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"Actually until I watched the movie, I heard lots of good critics. It's wonderful, very impressive etc. But I don't agree, the first half of movie was good and also funny, but I can't say the same thing to other half, it wasnt realistic. And I reckon not as good as people standarts"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"There have been a sparse few films in recent years that have melded genres seamlessly, performed at the absolute top of their game in technical craft, offered a scathing sociopolitical commentary, all while telling an airtight and compelling story. Luckily for us, Parasite (Gisaengchung) checks all of these boxes, in a year where we couldn't have needed it more badly. Bong Joon-ho's latest absolutely blows all else out of the water (at least compared to the other 30+ movies I've seen in theaters this year), and in a highly organic and original way. The issue of class and the struggles of the poor climbing the ladder to become wealthy is one that Bong Joon-ho is well-known for using, for instance in 2013's Snowpiercer, yet Parasite never at any point feels like it borrows from any of its predecessors or overlaps with them in any way. This is the film's greatest strength, in my opinion, that it so flawlessly weaves together all of its components, including an interesting and nuanced take on class-structure, originally and in such a way that it feels perfectly natural for the story being told. The same can be said for how Bong traverses from one genre to another. From minute to minute, Parasite will have you laughing uproariously, and then suddenly, have you dead-silent and on the edge of your seat. The comedy is dark and laugh-out-loud, while the suspense will make you want to lean in, if only to try and pull the characters out of the scene, so as to relieve the tension. It should be no surprise, that everything else also falls into place wonderfully, from the poignant performances, to the razor sharp editing, to the stunning cinematography. In a year with both high-budget and indie takes on class-struggle such as Joker and Us, Parasite still manages to stand out, in a class of its own."
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"This is way way over rated, its a 6 at best. Yes some bits are funny. But others it just drags on. The actings okay. Plots okay. Its just really an okay film overall. Nothing special."
기생충,Parasite,2019,4,,Over hyped nonsense. Too long and I didn't care what happened to characters. Needed to be a short film and im being generous. Although i thought the 3 dogs were better actors.
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"This film is always one step ahead of its audience. You are so in tune with the protagonists that by the time they are neck deep into their futile grift, the question of who's right or who's wrong isn't so much as being poised by the master director Bong Joon-ho; it's being slammed over your head with a rock. And when you recover, and the audience claps, the answer still isn't clear.  Parasite is deserving of all the massive praise it has received. That I saw this in a packed theater with an adoring, fully rapt crowd truly warmed my heart. It's cinema at its best.  As many folks are noting, and I will reiterate: go into this cold! Read as little about it as possible if you can. It will make the experience so much better. This is one I know I will be revisiting often over the years. Enjoy it."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"If you like cinema, dont miss this movie.  At last, ill been waiting so many years for a movie like this: a beautiful, powerful and great history who touch all the film genres, and do it SO well. Parasite is an awesone thriller who break with a lot of spin and turns a masterpiece script.  A director in state of grace talks about almost everything: the most inhuman capitalism, how the middle class just dissapear, an amazing tale about the life and death, about the dreams that grow and dies, about you cant runaway for who you really are, and the great hole between the human being.  Is better just go and see this movie with no idea about what it goes. Its the greatest film you see for decades. Believe me. ""Dont do any plans. Life dont go this way"""
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Excellent writing, acting, direction, drama, suspense and action. A must see this year."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"It took me while to be able to sit and review this movie. It has been difficult, almost impossible to put down into words anything about it. I truly lacked the right words and was even afraid not to be true to its core. Here's a film which leaves no one indifferent. It is certainly metaphorical in every aspect: the water that is both a blessing or a catatrophe depending on which side of the social pyramid one stands; the smell inpregnated in old people's clothes which both disgusts and arouses the rich couple; the large window in their house in comparison to the poor family 's basement window. The question starts with a simple title:""Parasite"". Who are they? The ones in the basement, at the bottom of the pyramid? The ones in the middle trying to strive, even if they cannot get rid of the smell? The ones on top of that pyramid who pretend to accept others yet lack total RESPECT? Or aren't WE all parasites somehow and loose perspective so often? Wasn't a camera leading our eyes all the time? For the first time in my life I had a feeling of real movement while watching a film. Sometimes I was moving left, right, up or down. Sometimes I was watching. Others I was being watched. The window could be either a screen to the outside world, inside the house. I often felt watched in the movie theatre Was I the parasite? If this isn't the Best Film of the year, I don't know what it us.👏👏👏"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,I love movies that criticize society and its different classes. This film combines humor and darkness and shows life from different perspectives. Love it!!
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I was looking forward to this movie all year, since i didn't like Roma (the international film front-runner and winner of 2018) as much as others did. This might just be the best foreign language film I have ever seen, with Portrait of a Lady on Fire (my personal favourite movie of the year) being one of the runner-ups.  This film was a transcendent cinematic experience for me, as Bong Joon Ho, the director of the movie makes it seem like its a walk in the park to go through the different genres in film. Movies are my favorite form of art and Parasite is just that: The Definition of Art. Lets go #Bonghive 🍯"
기생충,Parasite,2019,,,"I feel like I've learned something from watching this, I'm not sure what yet, but I loved it!  I didn't realise it had comedy in it, but feel like I laughed in all the right places.  The acting was superb and the whole concept of the had me fascinated and completely immersed.  I'm going to recommend it to friends but not sure how yet. I guess I'll tell them have an open mind and go with the flow, as it's an original and fascinating experience in film making and class culture. Something like that, I'm going to have an enjoyable rethink about what I just watched.  In fact I've decided I'm definitely going to watch it again at some point very soon.  Bravo 9.5/10"
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"9 star rating from YMS and a Palm d'Or. What have we here? A dark comedy from a great Korean director going back to his roots? Nois. I'll make sure I pay close attention to this one.  As expected, this film is good. However it could have easily been bad, if not for the brilliant cinematography, strong directorial sense, and most of all, thought provoking messages and philosophies that don't hold back at reflecting the brutal reality of class in our society. However, you aren't here to see me laud, you want to know why I don't hold it in as high regards as everyone else.  The film feels messy. Although the comedy is often effective, I don't think it fits well enough in this context. The story is innovative, though it does feel familiar in certain parts. The sudden mood changes aren't my cup of tea as well.  A lot of the plot points are just too over the top. They can be distracting. They can be too weird, especially regarding the climax/ending (you'll know what I mean). There are little bits of details that never got an answer till the end; or maybe I need more time to think about them, who knows. Lastly, the message is a little bit too obvious and shoehorned in.  It is hard to talk about the many aspects of the film without spoilers. At the end of the day I'll still highly recommend this film because, after all it is a good film, and supporting lesser known but highly acclaimed directors is always a good gesture. But I'm still in the process of figuring out why people love it so much. I guess I'm not too appreciative of Korean films considering my 7/10 rating for The Handmaiden, but this is open to change, and if you are willing to engage in well mannered discussion with me, I may learn to like it much more than I do."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Exceptionally written, ingeniously directed, and profoundly acted, PARASITE is a masterpiece of its own. This cleverly layered and twisted film is a social commentary about class division that seemingly tied into a perfectly paced and balanced multi genre that is packed with metaphors, implied messages, and symbols. PARASITE is an accomplishment for cinematic storytelling and world cinema that engross, surprise, and shocks."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"It's a perfect movie in every way, words can't even decribe this satisfying feeling I got right now after I've seen it. It's an emotional rollercoaster that everybody need to experience. I can't even begin to describe it. Just watch it."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Just watched this film yesterday, really love this story. And surprised the academy even knowledged it.😳"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"After hearing so praise much about Bong Joon-ho's latest film when it premiered at the Cannes film festival this year, I went in not trying to know too much about it. And it definitely lived up to the hype.  The Kim family struggles to get by as the father, Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho), is unemployed and are forced to live in run-down basement apartment in an already poor neighbourhood. Conning and manipulation is second nature to the family as it is their only means to ensure they come close to living. And once the opportunity comes in the form of the wealthy Park family needing a new English teacher for their teenage daughter, the Kim's young adult son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) takes the position to help his family get the money they need to escape their impoverished lifestyle. Through a series of planned and highly calculated manipulation and trickery, Ki-woo gets all of his family members employed but at the expense of getting the Park's previous driver and housemaid fired to steal their paid positions. Eventually the Kim's start living off the of the Parks's luxuries as if they entered the gates of heaven and awarded for their scheme.  To explain anything more would ruin the rest of the story. The joy of it will be watching the twists unfold as the ideas and themes of Parasite take on a very unique and unexpected look at the class dynamic. The film portrays neither families as the hero or villain of this story. Similar to his English-language sci-fi thriller Snowpiercer, Bong Joon-ho dives deep into a surreal, abstract world to explore the class dynamic between the wealthy and the poor. The difference in this being neither side is worth rooting for nor against. The Kim's take advantage of the Parks's naivety through their con as the most sure-fire way to gain the benefits that are denied to them because of their class status. And so it means they are ignorant to the moral consequences made by their scam until it is too late. Meanwhile, the Parks are so condition to their wealthy and privileged lifestyle they are oblivious to how unfair they treat the lower class while being paranoid and frightened by what doesn't meet their high expectations. The cruel unexpected circumstances of the film's events prove no matter how well planned things go, the poor will still in the end be feeding off the scraps of the rich that blindly ignore them.  Don't want to say anything much else about Parasite other then it is worth seeing without not much else about it. Go see it."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"When we were students at the art faculty, our teachers used to say, 'Art or an artist can't be unbiased; you pick a side and tell your story.' I never agreed with this notion. This film proves I was right."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Bong's movie is truly a masterpiece for the ages. I was honestly surprised to see such a turn in plot, feelings and actions. My heart was a roller coaster of emotions, laughing and being comfortably sitted and later on the edge of my seat, not laughing now but still rooting for them. The soundtrack was gorgeous, the editing superb, the acting was so genuine and looked effortless. This movie really spiked my interest not only in more of Bong's movies but in korean movies in general!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,Just watch the damn movie its awesome...hollywood has had its ass kicked...story is so original
기생충,Parasite,2019,,,"This movie was alright. The acting was good and story was fine, but the pacing and the overall tone of the movie was kinda dull, imo. I wasent that invested in the plot and characters. There are better movies out there this year, like FordV Ferrari and The lighthouse."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"It's not a bad movie and it has some great moments. But it's way too over hyped, like much award winning movies these days (insert gif of disapproving old Clint Eastwood in Gran Torino). You can tell it's a movie that wants to deliver a message; the problem is it's not quite clear what the message is."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,The plots are refreshing and thrilling and the movie itself has one of the best paces I recently experienced in a movie.  It was best described rollercoast slow ascendts and quik descents. I loved it!
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"The movie was well written, well acted, well paced, well filmed, well scored. Everything was pretty good. For me, it is a far cry from the best film I've seen. It might not even be in the top 10. Don't get me wrong. It was a very good movie worth watching, and worth watching on the big screen. I don't really get the masterpiece and best film ever comments. It was entertaining and thought provoking. Go see it, but ignore the super reviews as well as the bad reviews."
기생충,Parasite,2019,1,,"I was excited to see Parasite, due to rave reviews, and it winning best picture. I was warned by a theater worker that ""the first half-hour is slow, but then it gets really good"". So I made it through the first half-hour, and kept waiting for the ""really good"" part, only to find out that it was the exact same; more tedium by a family that was not really likable. The violence was not necessary either, and seemed to be a way to make it Oscar worthy. A lot of Oscar nominated movies have violence at the end, and that seems to be a way to get more respect, or something. It was sad, and horrible, in my opinion. I cannot wrap my mind around the fact that this movie, compared to 1917, Little Women and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, won best picture! Honestly what is going on with those who vote, that vote for this drivel? It was okay, don't get me wrong, but that's all--merely okay. (For the record, I love movies with subtitles, and have seen several amazing ones, but this was not one of them.)"
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"This whole film reminded me of ""10 clover field lane "" . It starts out and you think you know where it's going .. 5 turns and 5 wrong conclusions later there you are at the end still wondering if you got it right .  It didn't feel forced or silly .. it was powerful .. edge of your seat .. wanting to know what happens next all at the same time causing you to look introspectively within yourself in situations where you are the ""parasite "" or someone is to you .  Great acting .. great plot .. great twists . Worth the time . Honestly if I went in with lower expectations it would have been a 9 I was just expecting so much it was hard to surpass that .. but would highly recommend to anyone ."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"Comedy and tragedy, the combination of the two is what a Korean filmmaker really good at, and Bong Joon Ho is no exception. Started with comedy, you'll find yourself laughing and going with the flow as the movie suddenly change its color in the middle of it like you have never expected before: the reality of living in poverty in modern world, where one and one's family (and spouses) can automatically be dehumanized by society, with the same level of rats and cockroaches. The opposite goes for the movie itself, as it humanized itself when the two most tragic characters in the movie got snapped and decided that it's enough. One of the most important movie in 2019. Movies like this need to be produced more, and, if possible, outnumber the high-budgeted, massively-hyped, full-CGI, full-action movies."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"The way that this film respects its own characters is mind blowing. I really enjoyed watching this movie it's such a brilliant story with brilliant storytelling, it made me laugh cry and be scared in that order.. loved it, definitely gonna watch it again."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"This is not only the best film of 2019 but one of the best in the decades. The film does a wonderful job at crafting the story of the Kim family and their journey with the Parks. The film makes subtle nodes to the class differences between them which doesn't come across as preachy or in your face, which all adds up to a stunning ending. But outside of the class differences, the movie acts a good comedy as well in which you will be smiling at all the various antics of the Kim family does in order to fulfil their plan. Even though this might be a foreign film for non-Korean audiences and you have to read subtitles, you have to look past that because once you do, you wont regret watching this marvel of a film."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Parasite leaves a strong and lasting effect on viewers. It has surprising and funny story that turns out to be more than a life it self. Actually, it is a life, painted in all colors. In a film industry, Parasite is a Vincent van Gogh.  The last movie that evoked so many strong emotions was Precious, in 2009."
기생충,Parasite,2019,,,"The film was ok, I think a LOT of people tried to read into it too much and find way too much symbolism. It was ok for a movie to watch when you can't find anything else."
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"I didn't find the movie so interesting. It felt like Mr. Bong was so confused about how to end the movie. The story ran so fast and the household shown was extra ordinary naive, which is also abnormal as a such big businessman.  I couldn't break the 2 inch boundary of subtitle too. But this movie could be better."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"This film is art. You need a moment to get the scenario but then you are caught in it. It is breathtaking. It's fun and scary, dark and lovely and just sad. This is perfect in every way. This might need to sink in awhile but it is truely a cinegraphic masterpiece."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"O.M.G... I knew Parasite was going to be good, but I didn't expect it to be THAT good.  Parasite starts off with a simple premise. Yet, with what Bong Joon-ho accomplishes in this film is worthy of praise and reward. Every twist and turn is unexpected and the execution of the film is perfect.  No other word I can use to describe this film: perfect.  Every character in this film is ones that viewers can emphasize with. The themes of class conflict (also seen in Boon-ho's Snowpiercer) prevails in this film as well. It's stunning to see these dynamics play out.  In parts where you expect to know how the story will turn out, another curveball is thrown that catches the viewer off-guard. Yet nothing destroys the suspense of reality. There were moments in the film where I was biting my nails in suspense.  5/5. The timing, pacing, and execution of this film will be studied in future generations of filmmaking. This is by far one of the best films I've seen this year."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"I already have a good experience of korean movies, and this one has surely been one of my favourite, though to be honest, having a vague idea of what its plot is about when i decided to watch it, i was not that certain of what i could expect since films dealing according to critics and reviews with allegories and social messages always face my instinctive mistrust. Well, these elements are there too, but all slipped and fitted in a very intriguing and solid storyline which though starting as a light, almost comedian style plot, ends up in a bloodshed and furthermore in a very bitter truth, the realworld truth which is too hard to break free from. The film will capture your interest and attention within its first five minutes and this attention will be constantly increasing throughout its duration, a feature rather typical in this kind of stories where a rather insignificant and innocent act leads to a complicated and difficult to deal with situation like in many Cohen brothers films. Taking this in consideration one could say that the twist of this story is not that original after all, however this one, resulting in an escalating complication and a very bitter ending, is really irresistible, and certainly one of the best and most indriguing one you should expect from a movie! P.S Yesterday, global celebration of the Day of Greek language under the motto: ""Do you know you speak Greek?"". So, here's the tip of the day: Did you know that among plenty of others in your own whichever language, the title of this movie too, is actually a 100% greek word?"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"'Parasite - an organism that lives in or on an organism of another species (its host) and benefits by deriving nutrients at the other's expense.'  When working-class Woo-sik Choi gets a job tutoring Sao-dam, the daughter of the rich Park family, so begins the slow, progressive attachment of the parasite to its host. This is a domestic comedy/drama with universal undertones of class division that takes a dark turn in a climax that will leave you reeling. There are layers to the story which, without revealing the intricacies of plot, play on class tensions, identity and entrapment.  A genre-bending tour de force from South Korea, deftly told by writer-director Bong Joon-Ho and brilliantly inhabited by an award-winning ensemble cast. In a meritocracy who is the parasite and who is the host? A cinematic ode to scratching below the surface of an all too perfect picture only to release a scurry of hidden roaches."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"In 2006, when I went to an art house movie theater, I saw Bong Joon Ho's campy but awesome sci-fi horror monster movie ""The Host."" I was only 16, but I made sure from then on I would see all the things he directs.  When he began getting so much praise and attention in 2019 for ""Parasite,"" I was a little worried. I wasn't a fan of ""Snowpiercer"" (although it is well crafted), and when he worked with Netflix in 2017 to direct ""Okja,"" I was even more disappointed.  But this afternoon, with my parents, I saw ""Parasite"" at Cinemark before the Oscars. As my previous review of it says, it is now one of my all time favorite films I've ever seen. I figured, however, given the Academy's fancy for war films, I just knew ""1917"" would take home the award for Best Motion Picture of the Year, and in all fairness, that was an amazing film. When Jane Fonda opened the envelope and stared for a moment, I was worried that the one film I wasn't terribly impressed with, ""Ford v. Ferrari,"" was the winner. Again, that was a technical feat for sure, but in my book it was the only one nominated for the best pic category that I felt it didn't deserve the win.  Jane Fonda, with surprised grandness (and obvious shock), announced that one word: ""Parasite."" There are many films that have won Best Picture that I've gushed over (remember my obsession with ""The Shape of Water""?), but this announcement made my heart leap with elation; that same sensation you get when your crush kisses your cheek and whispers ""I like you too.""  Bong Joon Ho...I am so happy for you."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"Parasite: A con-artist family preys on an upper-class couple and their children. That's the bare bones of this film but it is a multi-layered black comedy thriller which heaps the satire on with a trowel but never falters as the brilliant script and direction by Bong Joon-ho keeps things going at a brisk canter. A tale of class war as the condescension shown to the servants is all too obvious, there is a line which must never be crossed by the hired help. The way the Kim family inveigle their way into the wealthy Park's home is a joy to observe. First the son as an English tutor then the daughter as an art therapist followed by the father and mother as chauffeur and housekeeper, the existing servants just cast aside. Something odd then happens which would be a spoiler if revealed but it alters the tone of the film. Things proceed towards a dark climax which ventures into the area of quotidian horror. Another masterpiece by Bong Joon-ho which he (partially) based on his own experiences as a maths tutor to the son of a well off family. 9/10."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Parasite is a true work of art and a rare and extraordinary masterpiece that should be viewed by all, especially film lovers. If you're planning to watch this movie avoid spoilers at all costs. It will have you conflicted on who you are rooting for. Parasite taps into the tensions caused by the widening gap between the rich and poor around the world. It's a darkly, entertaining and suspenseful look at a poor but incredibly cunning family and the rich Park family, their polar opposites. The film makes you play a guessing game on which of the two families are more rotten. Parasite shows the extent to which we go to in order to live a comfortable life. It's best to go into the movie not knowing too much about what you're about to see, and let it's sly power sneak up on you. Who are the real parasites? The poor who attach themselves to the rich or the rich that suck the marrow of the poor."
기생충,Parasite,2019,,,"This is one of those movies from a director who has done some interesting movies before, which gets a gigantically good rating and seems the overall most well-produced, but is on the whole boring or insufferable, even while at times amusing or properly ""tragic"". The story has elements of crude metaphor, of course, and shows characters, who at first seemed to behave with magical skill, later behave pointlessly and foolishly to get to a dramatic enough finale."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"Reviewing this movie is a unique challenge for me. As a Japanese person, I've always had a special connection to Asian cinema, even if I haven't always been a fan of the style. My interest in Korean and Japanese movies is often driven by nostalgia rather than a refined taste for the acting and directing styles. It's not that these movies are bad, it's just that my preferences lean elsewhere.  However, there are exceptions. One Korean movie that truly left a mark on me is Oldboy. If you haven't seen it yet, I urge you to skip the Hollywood remake and dive straight into the original. This movie is a visceral experience that will leave you reeling.  The same feeling applies to Parasite. Again, I need to become more familiar with the director and actors. I went to the theater to watch this mainly because of the many praises, awards, and the surprising Oscar nomination for both the Best International Movie and Best Movie categories. Of course, I had to check it out.  When I first sat down to watch Parasite, I had no idea what to expect. The movie starts off like a slice-of-life soap opera, a slow burner that gradually builds tension. But as the story unfolds, the tension escalates, leading to a gripping climax that will keep you on the edge of your seat.  I can't speak too much, not to spoil the surprises and twists. And, oh boy, there are many twists to this plot. It's best to avoid reading anything about the story so you are surprised.  Overall, the directing is superb. The screenplay is not complicated, and it's very well written. The acting is also competent, mixing moments of comedy and tension very well. But, it feels ""dry,"" if it makes any sense.  This is definitely only a movie for some. And as I have minimal exposition to Korean filmmaking, I don't have many other references than Oldboy (and the rest of the Vengeance Trilogy movies, which I'm not too fond of so much). But Oldboy has such a visceral punch that it's hard to forget, even years after I watched it.  Parasite lacks this punch even though the kind of storytelling is similar in a way: a tragedy. Don't get me wrong; it's a very good movie to go see in the theaters. But IMHO, I don't know why this movie is Oscar material. Alas, yes, there are several other nominees, but I also don't understand why they are Oscar material.  From another perspective, for most of the movie, it reminded me of a Tarantino movie. Again, it still needs the punch. But it's textbook Tarantino through and through. The 2nd half is particularly striking and goes super deep into total madness. That's why you want to go to the theater to watch.  I gave Oldboy a very solid 8 out of 10, and I highly recommend you watch it. Parasite is a bit behind, and I think it deserves a solid 7 out of 10."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"One of the best movies I have ever watched in years. The life of the rich and the poor yet never felt cliché, not even once. Very unpredictable and the anxiety you get from watching the movie is thrilling yet you don't know which character to root for because they have their own stories. So please watch it,, you won't regret it."
기생충,Parasite,2019,5,,"Not sure why its hyped so much. Its a normal movie, not so great and definately not oscar worthy. Jojo rabbit is far better. I watched it after all the hype and i was dissapointed."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"In an age of superhero movies (which I love) comes a story that is so captivating and engaging from early on that I hope it wins an Oscar. Unlike other years where the ""Oscar buzzy"" movies are really drawn out or not that great, this movie is something that everyone can understand and the story flow, twists and turns and commentary on society all are so well done. My wife and I loved this movie. This is definitely a classic."
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"One of the best films! The way this movie takes you in the history is just the right way, everything connects perfectly. Well written and there is no notable mistakes. If you like thrillers and seen other things that American films this is the movie. One of the best movies in 2019"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,This is of the best original movies I have seen in a long time. I'm usually not a huge foreign movie fan unless it's a good horror movie but this movie really was that good. Just when you think you have an idea where the movie is heading it completely surprises you.
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"All the actors were convincing, intense performances by all of them. Great directing, art and photography. Some of the most beautiful shots I have seen , specially considering the places they were showing."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"This is one of those rare movies that actually transcend the astronomical hype surrounding it. So many elements of this film are packed with depth and richness. Funny, brutally sad, suspenseful, entertaining, and strange. Cannot say enough good things about the seamless transitions and rhythms of the directing.  Parts of this movie have been branded in my brain forever, and I'm completely fine with that.  I am huge Bong Joon-Ho fan, and this is his best movie to date. Right above Memories of Murder."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,Tigers every human emotion  its hilarious its dark its original its powerful its thought provoking  time well spent
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"The movie was really good! It's worth watching! The struggle of classes and the gap between them is visible in this movie, but all is is dressed with a lot of humor, unexpected events and a storyline and plot that won't let you down or make you feel bored at any moment!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"There are many reasons why Korean movies are a top notch and Bong Joon is definitely one of those. This Lynchian styled narrative is surely to take you for a ride. The movie starts with a light hearted tone but gets seriously dangerous with unexpected turns of events. The movie shows off the dark secrets of both rich and the poor and our judgement towards them. It's a confusing perspective for the viewer on who to feel sorry for, which side to take. Excellent!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,1,,"PARASITE (2019)  I watched Parasite out of curiousity after it won the Oscar. Well, I watched half of it and fast forwarded through part. The trailer repelled me, so I decided not to watch it before this point. The cinematography was wonderful, but once again, my view is in the minority in terms of public reaction to a popular film. I found the movie sadistic and disturbing. Rather than a provoking statement about class, I saw a dark, sick film laced with contempt, gratuitous violence, caricatures of people, and unlikeable characters with no moral compass. How utterly depressing."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I was looking forward to watch some kind of survival thriller,that's what i thought from the title but it was completely different but still so convincing.It is a high quality movie and a must watch to understand the level of korean thrillers.After watching this movie only one word came iut of my mouth ""Brilliant"", and understood why it got 10 mins standing ovation at film festival 💥"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"A movie that has an entertaining story in the surface and deep meanings as you dive in.  The director played it safe by introducing a simple story and gave it a god-tier build up with twisted plot. This is brilliant , you don't have to complicate it in order to get audience attention.  I am sure people will diverge and make speculations about the ending , and will never forget this movie as they live."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"""Snowpiercer"" was very good, ""Parasite"" is even better! Bong Joon-ho delivers a clever analysis of the class society in which we live today in his ingenious thriller, which is horror film, comedy and drama at the same time. A poor family invades the home of a rich family and starts working for them. But who are the real parasites? The society of the rich is characterized by friendliness and serenity - but it's precisely this habitus that you first have to be able to afford. And it shouldn't fool us about the balance of economic power. We don't see good or bad individuals in ""Parasite"", rather Bong Joon-ho has created character masks for his characters in order to expose the class relations. Moreover, ""Parasite"" is a thrilling and aesthetically brilliant movie, in which there isn't a single wrong picture."
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,Simply amazing! One of the best movies I watched in 2019. Keeps you on the edge all the way. Great flow. The end was something.
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Are you kidding me, that this movie wasn't nominated at BAFTA, I guess all the people voting must have been too wealthy to understand this movie."
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,A hard up Korean family slyly manipulate themselves into different jobs working for one wealthy family.  The story takes an unexpected turn when a visitor arrives.  This movie received a lot of good hype and it makes a social commentary. It's very well made but ultimately I did not really like the whole story being told. Not sure I would recommend.
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"A few moments into the movie, you start realizing that you are in the hands of a master storyteller, as without any exposition you are familiarized with all the characters and thier surroundings.  Director Bong Joon Ho has dabbled in murder mysteries, dystopian science fiction, as well as monster movies but this time he takes a very grounded and personal tale which makes you laugh, empathise, grin, and sit at the edge of your seat. By winning the Palme D'or at Cannes and hosting sold out screenings, Parasite had placed Bong Joon Ho in the cadre of the new masters of cinema.  The best way to to enjoy the movie is to go cluelessly into it, but what i can say about the plot is that it is flawless in writing and is edited to perfection. Not a single scene meanders and the story is tightly focused on the characters. Which brings me praise Kang-Ho Sok, who plays the father of the Kim family, making us sigh with his disappointment and smile whenever he takes pride in his family.  The cinematography in Parasite is a highlight as you get to see the grimy trinkets of Kim family's semi-basement house and polished expanse of park family's uptown villa. The background score selection is appropriate and perfectly blends in, while enhancing the drama.  While Parasite might be a suspenseful drama on surface level, it has layers to it in terms of metaphors and messages. It communicates class divide, makes us question the moral compass of the characters and ourselves, and makes you question: who is the real parasite in the movie?  Watch the movie and answer the question for yourselves."
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,It's a good movie but really it's over rated. It is also little boring and slow
기생충,Parasite,2019,1,,I was so curious to download this film ever since i read the reviews which are mostly positive. Turns out Parasite is just another predictable story that didnt put me on the edge of the seat as it was promised. I am seriously shocked Cannes chose this film to be its winner for 2019
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Edit: After the Oscars craze, i felt compelled to talk about the ""good, but overrated"" comments that I see more and more. Parasite is the perfect example of contemporary art. It's very easily digestible by the masses, as it is an objectively entertaining movie that even Marvel-DC-audiences can enjoy. However this movie is so layered that you can dig for days and still find hidden meanings and metaphors. They're subtle enough though, that a casual viewer can ignore them without loosing any part of the entertainment aspect. Those who seek an important and complex message can find it, and those who seek a 2-hour entertainment can also find it. Therefore we have the ""good, but overrated"" phenomenon.  I've just recently been introduced to the S.Korean film industry. After a long break from contemporary Hollywood movies, my faith and excitement for cinema has been restored thanks to S.Korean films. I firstly want to talk generally about the differences between big Hollywood blockbusters and what I've experienced with Korean cinema so far. Just for reference, the Korean movies I've seen so far are basically crime/drama/mystery movies with my top 3 being: 1. Parasite, 2. the Chaser, 3. Memories of murder. But there are many that I've yet to watch. What all of those movies have in common is the fact that they are not afraid to be a)real enough to make you relate and feel like you are part of that world, b)funny with respect to the story and the characters, and c) weirdly they felt like they weren't trying too much. I don't know if it's just me being sick of all the Hollywood's ""trying to be super cool"" act, but I find it refreshing to see a movie not talking itself too seriously, but at the same time handling very serious topics without losing the balance of all the above mentioned characteristics. And I find that very hard to do, it really is a thin line. I am so excited to have discovered S.Korean cinema, and i wish more people would not be afraid of the non-Hollywood film industry, as I was.  So, regarding Parasite. If you haven't seen the movie yet, and considering watching it, GO WATCH IT! Don't read anything else. Don't research and ideally don't even watch the trailer. This movie stuck with me for days after watching it. I wish I could forget what I watched and watch it again with a clean slate. What an experience it was! My spoiler-free thoughts: This movie is a master-class in film making and cinematography. All the symbolism and the brilliant shots were so subtle, nothing was thrown in your face. I would almost describe it humble in all its glory. This movie, even if you watch it on mute, has still a story to tell you. Absolutely genius! All praise to director Bong! I don't remember the last time I watched a film and didn't check my phone at all during it. I would say, most films, even the best ones, have some filler shots, meaning they have some kind of low energy points. Parasite had me hooked throughout every single minute of it. In other words, you will not get bored. It's so surprisingly entertaining through all its aspects and genres. Dark comedy, mystery, thriller, drama. They blend so good, and seamlessly that it's almost hard to pay attention to them, because the plot just unravels so naturally that it just seems normal to change the whole mood of the movie. Have you any idea how hard it is to do that, how complicated it is? But somehow Bong managed to make it look easy and natural. When I was a kid, I remember watching the Olympics with my dad. I mostly enjoyed watching the divers. I remember saying to my dad how easy it looked, and how I could probably do it, too (shame on my sweet innocent self, I know). And my dad responded with something that stuck with me: ""Whenever you think that something that somebody is doing looks easy, that is because they are freakishly good at it, and it's actually almost impossible to do by anyone else, and that they have failed and cried and almost gave up probably a million times"". So, respect to the professionals. This movie reminded me of that. Something extremely difficult that seems easy, and effortless."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"At the beginning of this movie we watch the Kim family struggle to survive in our modern and advanced society. Yes, I am being sarcastic. That's all I have left when talking about a society where the hardship of extreme poverty is often contrasted with the excesses of extreme wealth. You might argue that without such problems in our society we wouldn't have so much material to work with and create such wonderful stories as the one depicted in Parasites. Good point, but I will get back to this at the end of my review.  The Kim family's struggle to survive is wonderfully illustrated with a perfect balance between funny and sad. We often feel like laughing but then, strangely enough, we also feel like we shouldn't. Something that will quickly become obvious is the connection between the members of the Kim family. They are acting as a tight unit. One might think that's normal since people usually unite against a common enemy, in this case, poverty. But it is also true that this is a family, not just a group of poor people. They care about each other. Anyway, coming back to the plot, they will interact with the rich Park family and that's all I think I should tell you. How they will do it, what will happen as a consequence is a complex plot which moves like a rise to the top of a mountain, followed by a rapid descent once we passed the peak. You will know immediately when that happens. This moment, obvious to me, was nevertheless striking and masterfully done.  As my step-daughter brought to my attention, no one is the main character, all the main characters, all 10 of them, are important, and extremely well acted. Music is used parsimoniously and judiciously as a counterpoint to accelerated sequences which help keep the plot flowing smoothly, and therefore, avoids dead times. The camera work, although sometimes creative, is most often straight to the point. It shows us the situation and wastes no time on useless but beautiful imagery. In other words, every shot counts.  This movie, while telling us an interesting story, is also a social statement. And, as I indicated at the beginning of this review, I see this as a great illustration of the consequences of living in a sick society. Sure, it is nothing new, but it brings to mind many questions. The most important to me: do we, as a species who is supposed to be intelligent, continue in the current direction, and continue to make interesting stories, or do we stop, clean up our act, and create only fantasy stories in worlds which are not our own? Note how the Kim family is actually pretty smart and resourceful. And yet, they are poor. Yeah s. it happens, and more often than not, just because of the way our society works, or rather, doesn't."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Parasite is the best movie of the year. This Korean movie won the renowned Palme d'Or of the 2019 Cannes Film Festival. It has been selected as the South Korean entry for Best International Feature Film at the ninety-second Academy Awards.  This movie combines multiple genres such as comedy, drama, horror, thriller and tragedy. The main theme is the clash between rich and poor in the Republic of Korea. This conflict has been the main topic in other great films such as The Housemaid and The Taste of Money. Parasite however is less cumbersome, melodramatic and moralizing and convinces with wit, depth and creativity instead.  International audiences might feel slightly confused by this unusual genre mixture at first contact but this is exactly what makes this movie so unique. The story starts in a dramatic way and portrays a poor family who lives in a small semi-basement apartment and struggles to make ends meet. The movie gets more comedic when the son of said family gets the unexpected opportunity to replace a friend as English tutor for the beautiful daughter of a wealthy family. The film turns into a thriller when the four family members gradually infiltrate and even replace the personnel of the wealthy family with ethically questionable procedures. The movie turns into a horror film when the family realizes that the family mansion hides a creepy secret as things gradually spin out of control. The film ends as an almost surreal tragedy that will leave the audience speechless. Parasite is a movie the leaves a lasting impression, offers much food for thought and should animate philosophical discussions. The movie is so detailed, precise and profound that it deserves to be purchased to be watched time and again.  I'm grateful that I had the opportunity to watch this movie in French in a Canadian cinema and so were the numerous other members of the audience in the packed movie theatre. People are craving for a change and are tired of tame, predictable and repetitive Hollywood superhero prequels, remakes and sequels. There should be more creative, dynamic and entertaining international movies like Parasite in movie theatres all around the world. If you desire to make a statement in favour of cinema as an artistic expression rather than shallow entertainment, do yourself a favour and enjoy this incredible movie on the big screen. This movie has the potential to become a cult classic and deserves all the praise it gets."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"This movie without a doubt is the best movie I've seen in years. 2019 has been a slow year for movies, and the 2010s in general - jam packed with superhero movies that are all the same and hundreds of sequels. But this movie is quite the gem.  It blends comedy, suspense, family, and a little romance in a beautiful way into a brutal commentary of class and society. I'd love to say more but it's better going into it knowing nothing about it so I'll leave it at that.  Go see this movie."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"The best movie of 2019 has everything: great acting, fabulous screenplay, with funny, tense and plot-twist moments, excelent directing, social critics and acid jokes. A monumental (but easy-to-consume) piece of art that satisfies all audience's tastes. Highly recommended."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Everyone said ""Go see Parasite"". Everyone said ""The one rule about Parasite is that you don't talk about Parasite"". So I went to see Parasite. So this is a review about Parasite without talking about Parasite.  Kim Ki-Woo (Woo-sik Choi) is a student living with his family in poverty in a sub-basement room, sponging off internet signals and scrounging a living, of sorts, by assembling pizza boxes. Opportunity presents itself when his best friend, the slightly older Min (Seo-joon Park), goes abroad to study. For Min is an English tutor to the up-market Park family's school-age daughter Da-hye (Ji-so Jung). Not wanting his fellow 'frat-boys' to move in on future romance - he's lined up Ki-Woo as his replacement.  Ki-woo knows he's lucked in when he visits the swanky Park residence and manages to pull the wool over the eyes of Da-hye's not too bright mother Yeon-kyo (Yeo-jeong Jo). But the influence of the family's ""lucky rock"" doesn't stop there. Ki-woo sees an opportunity to get jobs for his sister Kim (So-dam Park), his father Ki-taek (Kang-ho Song) and his mother Chung-sook (Hye-jin Jang). And gradually the poor Kim family start to encroach on the rich Park family's lives.  You might think that's the story. It's not. Just when you think you know where the film is going - a gentle comic tale with farcical elements - the movie takes a sudden left turn into The Twilight Zone.  To say more, if you've not seen the film, would be cruelty beyond measure. It's a truly astonishing script, by writer/director Bong Joon Ho, and my nomination for the Oscar for best original screenplay.  It's the details that get to you. This will be a superb film to watch multiple times. There are fabulous details scattered throughout. You know how the more expensive the car the more ""solid"" the clunk is as you shut the door? Listen to the sound effect when the Park front door shuts! Look what happens to the ""one of a kind"" lucky rock!  As for one of my favourite films from last year - ""The Farewell"" - you very quickly get to accept and embrace the subtitles. YOU MUST NOT LET THIS PUT YOU OFF. This is a masterpiece of cinema, well-deserving of its multiple Oscar nominations and its Cannes Palme d'Or award. At 132 minutes, it's not a short film, but seldom have two hours flown by faster. It's totally gripping. At times hysterically funny; at times shocking. A class struggle movie of a calibre that Ken Loach would never have imagined!  Gripes? I had just one. An action near the end of the movie seems bizarrely out of character and was a ""WTF"" moment that I didn't think the film needed. However, it did set up a wonderful story-telling finale that I will think about for many months.  It provoked that seldom found reaction in the cinema when the end-titles ran. A hubbub of chatter and appreciation.  It comes with a highly recommended from me.  (For the graphical version of this review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook.)"
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,I think this film is overrated. Not sure about all the coincidences happened to the family members are making sense.
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"Parasite is, if not the best, definitely one of the top 5 movies of 2019. The film is almost perfect in every aspect possible.  Both the cinematographer Kyung-pyo Hong and the director Bong Joon-ho make an outstanding job with a production design that is off the charts. These three aspects together result in one of the most eye-grabbing movies of the decade. Every shot is, at the same time, beautiful and meaningful, to the point that you could understand the whole movie even if it had no dialogues.  The screenplay is also one of the strengths of the film. Bong Joon-ho and Han Jin-won came up with a great idea that is as original as it gets and managed to make it funny, interesting, sarcastic, sad and verisimilar. The movie shows the difference between classes like ""Roma"" (2018), but has the rhythm and its core similar to ""Get Out!"" (2017).  Every character is important and has its moment of protagonism. Due to the complexity and the nuances put in the screenplay, none of the characters is a villain or a hero. The only villains in this story are the unfairness of the capitalistic society and the lack of empathy of wealthy people towards the less resourceful ones.  The acting by all the main cast is sublime, but the highlights are Kang-ho Song and Yeo-jeong Jo. Kang-ho plays Kim Ki-taek, father of the Kim family. He captures the essence of this experienced man that has gone through a lot in his life and has his pride taken from him in the course of the movie, making his character's arc of development the most interesting of the film. Yeo-jeong plays Yeon-gyo, mother of the Park family. She is the complete opposite of Ki-taek; she's naive and has, and seemingly has always had, an easy life. She's clearly not aware of the things that happen outside her bubble, and that makes her vulnerable to smart people like the Kim family.  Last, but definitely not least, the music. It dictates the current state of the film and manipulates the spectator so you get absolutely fixated on the screen. It has hints of suspense, comedy and even horror.  Parasite (2019) is one of the finest movies made in the past decade and, most certainly, deserves a watch. It's eye-grabbing in every sense of the word and really fun to watch, but is also very dense and insightful, providing a vision of how things work that's not usually shown in the mainstream content."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"First off the Movie is absolutely ok, but i can't believe it won an oscar! I think it's a good example of todays influence by the media considering this huge hype and overinterpretation. At least the Movie is polarizing but it's far from a masterpiece - it's ok!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,5,,With all the hype around this film and winning the most prestigious award in film with the Oscar for best Picture I was expecting a lot more out of this movie. The story is great with a broke family hustling themselves into working for a rich family in Korea one job at a time was pretty good but the acting was very cartoonish to me. There's a lot of dialogue in this movie and sure it is a well-written script but these actors seem to just be reading the lines a lot of the time and not using their body language to really express the characters as much as I'm accustomed to through American film. I'm very disappointed in this movie and completely shocked that it won best picture. Surely there has to have been a better film made in 2019 than this? I give it 5/10
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"The plot is awesome. Bang jon hoo know how to portait. The background team worked hard to deliver this simple but awesome thriller that changed every cinematic experience I have ever seen. Actors are perfect. Everyone must see, can be seen with family."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Parasite is a thrilling, funny, surprising and satirical society. This is perfect film."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"It starts as a high quality comedy movie but things getting change. General look at Parasite, it's true to say that it's kind of horror movie couse' of the main idea. People like Kim family, lives in the real world society and doing ""parasiting"" to other people. This is one of the best movies in 2019 and director's best work after Snowpiercer."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I went into this movie without knowing anything about it. I had no expectations whatsoever but holy hell does it deliver. It is one of the best films I have ever seen. It's constantly evolving, never boring and so unpredictable. Bong Joon Ho is truly a genius and this is pure art. Everything about this film is perfect, there is not one thing I could name that i would change about it. It deserves all the praise it is getting. What a film."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"This is one of the best movies of the new century. All characters are real and to some extent relatable. While the movie is Korean and leverages Korean culture in many parts, the multicultural, universal takes what made this movie so great.  Most importantly, while the movie does make a lot of comments with regards to class differences, it constantly refrains from taking side or lecturing the audience."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Now THAT's how you make a movie! Kudos to the writer/director, cast and crew for making such a neo-classic work of art! If this movie doesn't win some Oscars, it'll be a crime against humanity!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"Good show, fun ride, quite fresh, definitely not overdone. But at a 8.6 rating, the community is saying it's better than The Green Mile, Whiplash, Interstellar, Gladiator and Terminator 2. I personally do not think it's on that level yet. Maybe its score has to do with how all the indian shows are highly rated on here."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I have seen every film he has made other than his first film. I liked them all but felt all of them were overrated other than Memories of Murder. I felt that second film of his was his best until Parasite . I loved every frame of this film. And such a creative plot. This is easily my favorite non American film in years. It is the kind of film that you see with a friend or your partner and want to discuss for hours. It is not a film I really want to discuss too much.The less you know the better. The purpose of this review is to tell people that have felt the same way about Bong Joon-Ho as I have in the past, that this time all the accolades are deserved. This is a true masterpiece that will be studied for years to come in film classes all over the world."
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"Finally got around to watching this movie, even though being a long time Korean movie fan.  Unsure how this won an Oscar and has such a high rating. Thought the same with Spirited Away, appears that these movies won Oscars for being different to the Hollywood norm, I think so anyway.  It was a fun watch, but not the best of movies like others would suggest. If you have seen many Korean movies before, you will understand that they don't follow the typical Hollywood formula. Watching this is nothing new and there are far better examples of amazing Korean movies.  Overall, this is worth a watch for sure, but it isn't the best of any genre IMHO."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"If you're looking for a comedy, brutal, dark and drama movie,this is the movie for you. The way they switched from one genre to another is so smooth you'll enjoy every bit of minute watching it. The whole story line is great. 😁"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,One of the best films of the decade... With an impressive cast and a talented and an critically acclaimed directed this movie delivers what it promises.
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"In the midst of Writer and Director Bong Joon Ho's ""Parasite"" wealthy Korean High-Tech CEO Dong-ik Park, played by handsome bold Sun-kyun Lee, describes to his wife Yeon-kyo, played by beautifully capricious Yeo-jeong Jo: His new driver Kim, played by brilliantly overwhelmed Kang-ho Song. Dong-ik says of Kim, ""He never crosses the line."" Consequently, he hasn't had to fire Kim.  Paradoxically, Bong's ""Parasite"" purposely 'crosses the line', often amazing us or has us thinking, WTF? That's the inspired genius of Bong and Jin Won Han's screenplay, and Bong's visionary art. There's the curious dynamic. Aside from genuinely charming Woo-sik Choi, who plays Kim's son Ki-woo (also known as Kevin), the Kim and the Park families are essentially unsympathetic. ""It's all about them"". In the bizarre star-crossed love story, Kevin is in love in with the Parks' daughter Da-hye, played by cute innocent Ji-so Jung.  Bong and Jin construct their narrative: The poverty plagued Kim's insinuate into the lives of the very rich Park's. Innocuously, Ki-woo's best friend Min, played by bright charismatic Seo-joon Park, asks him to tutor Da-hye Park (Ji-so) while he's away at college. Really, Min asks Ki-woo to look after Da-hye, because Min is in love with her. Yeah, we get how that will go.  Min cautions that her Mom Yeon-kyo (Yeo-jeong) is rather unique. Initially, Yeon-kyo occurs as the unhappy wife and substance abuser. Although, Ki-woo is not the college graduate, his adept sister Ki-jung, played by beautifully acute So-dam Park, brilliantly forges her brother college degree documentation for his job interview with Yeon-kyo. He goes by Kevin.  Once acquiring Da-hye's tutor gig, Ki-woo deduces the way to get his sister Ki-jung (So-dam) as the art teacher for Park's troubled son Da-Song, played by untamed Hyun-jun Jung. Ki-jung poses as cousin Jessica. Similarly, the Kim's infiltrate as familial imposters in the Park household. Mom Chung-sook, played by sensible Hye-jin Jang, replaces legacy Housekeeper Moon-gwang, played by solid Jeong-eun Lee.  Now, the poverty riddled Kim's vicariously roll in wealth and luxury. At the zenith of their dysfunctional excess, the family parties in complete inebriation in the pristine Park living room, while the Parks are on camping vacation. Naïve Ki-woo even fantasies of one day marrying Da-hye, the love of his very young life.  Eventually, Director Bong's narrative spirals into the absurd macabre at warp speed. Honestly, I was the only person laughing out loud in the theater at times. Surprise twists reveal. The absurd hysterical devolves into absurd hysteria. I believe Bong's inventive madness does serve his purpose.  In the quiet scene at the Park home, Ki-woo sadly yearns while looking upon all the beautiful rich people at a Birthday party. It's his life that might have been. Rather, it's his life that isn't.  Director Bong brazenly explores the very fringes of sociopathy with both artistic style and menacing humor in ""Parasite"". His narrative is ultimately about karma. Absolutely there are consequence for what we do. What we do, can and will come back at us.  Yes, ""Parasite"" is darkly hysterical, in your face provocative. It's great to look at with authentic performances. ""Parasite"" might be one of best movies of 2019. I really liked the movie a whole lot.  All that being said: ""Parasite"" is not my very favorite movie of 2019. Perhaps, humanity by its very design is dark and light. At least for me, ""Parasite"" fails in its balance of the dark and the light. Again, just saying."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"This movie is so great . In my opinion , parasite is one of top 10 movies of the last decade ."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Damn you south Korea. This is a top notch movie with high effective result. Storyline, acting, bgm and colour grading were so catchy. After watching this movie only one question is bouncing in my head, Who is the parasite ???"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,This movie left me speechless. A true masterpiece. Really creative and innovative.
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"Although I enjoyed watching the movie, I don't understand why people say this is one of the best movies of the decade. The ending is kinda weird and the middle of the movie is also boring"
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"This movie is moderately good. I can't believe how it won Oscars. It won even feature in that top 20-30 movies I have seen. There is too much hype around it. I have watched much better movies both Western and Indian which portrays raw class, caste, religious and gender divide."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,Saw this movie today after keeping it for shelves for 2 months......a reality in today's world...... acting was top notch. Don't have any words to explain the story. It's simple mind-blowing. Keeps you on hook till the end. One of the best korean movies of the last decade. Hopefully no one will remake it and spoil this classic
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Bong Joon Ho has an amazing track record. Memories of Murder, Mother, and the Host are fantastic, Okja was awesome and Snowpiercer is good. He's never made a bad movie and with now seeing Parasite twice, I can say he's still going strong. Moreover this might be his best film or at least competes with it (Memories of Murder is still a considerable contender.) The madman went as far as I say, to making the second best movie of the year, only behind the Lighthouse for me. But for everyone else it's their number one and deservedly so. It's just one of those masterpieces everyone and anyone can enjoy, critic and casual viewer alike. The end strikes with blunt surprise and it was nice to gauge the theaters reaction after knowing what was going to happen. Bongs drama and comedy have always meshed so well together without bringing the tension out the scene but with this movie there's that and this amazing tone shift near the midpoint that fits like a puzzle piece; changing the atmosphere, themes, and style in a way that makes 100% sense. It's like many movies in one. This will be talked about as being a classic of the decade for these reasons because of how perfectly it was done.  Without spoiling too much, this movie is about class. And not in the obnoxious in-your-face way where the poorer characters can do no wrong and there's an obvious message of ""rich bad, poor sad"" but done in the way by subverting those tropes by making the poor flawed but smart and the rich into gullible people. Themes and messages the movie has are very subtle to being said out loud: that being mostly about exploring the ""line"" between class. Whether that be through extremely great writing or literally through the directing and how it's shot. The whole film is like this where a line in the shot separates the two classes. It's done through lines in the wall, one genius moment of a reflection on a window as it's being looked out of, a fridge, or just as simple as panning down like in the beginning to show they're the lowest of the low in a already low shot. How they view the same things such as rain tells a whole lot too. While the rich enjoy its beauty and smell, the poor despise it because it floods the neighborhood and house in a very tense dramatic scene. Another nice touch is where they're located: the poorer family living at the bottom of the hill get the brute end of the storm while the rich on top are unaffected. But how the poor view and react to other fellow poor people in a twist situation was the point where I knew this movie was genius. Rather than live together, they fight, accomplishing nothing but a good time for the audience.  The performances are memorable and witty and not one dimensional, each with a purpose and each one being immensely entertaining in their own way. They all had a time to shine and they did with flying colors. Bongs directing prowess is at an all time high as every frame and movement feels methodically thought out. His gorgeous use of cinematography, seamless editing, and music fits so well and help flesh out the soothing, chaotic, and claustrophobic atmosphere/tone. The set design was also noticeably pleasing as it explores into the themes more. I would give my interpretation on the rock but that would spoil it. I have nothing more to say other than don't read much else about it and go in blind if you can. 10/10"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Bong Joon Ho's film about an impoverished family of petty criminals in Korea is full of menacing, mischievous energy and spiked with sharply-drawn characters, with varying shades of moral and ethical decay. It's a rare film you will remember for its sheer personality and exciting twists and turns.  It's best to go into this film knowing as little as possible. The family of con artists sees its fortunes take a turn when one day the son by pure chance gains access to the residence of a super wealthy family. The rest should be found out on screen as this film proceeds at a visceral pace and never misses at beat.  Performances are strong all around but the father of the family of criminals is brilliantly portrayed by Song Kang-ho, as he embodies all the boldness and fears of a devoted parent who will do anything to provide for his family, however shady and immoral his choices become. He also exemplifies the steadfast defiance of a working class man who refuses to be held down by those more powerful. The rock of the family, he is one of the most likeable protagonists ever.  For all the vitality and edginess of this film, there is also a residual melancholy feel to the story. Through all the bitter class struggle and criminal audacity at work here, there remains a lingering shred of human dignity. Grandly recommended."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,I watched this right after I was blown away by joker and didn't think anything that year could get better.
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"Had to see what everyone was raving about and that it won best picture. Started ok but became tedious very quickly. No subplots, gave impression of gullible rich. Lacking imagination and poor ending. Yep it was okish"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"It's difficult to review a movie like this without revealing any spoilers. For real, you definitely want to avoid spoilers on this one. So, I'll just leave you with this.  Parasite is an absolute must-watch movie for anyone who loves movies. You owe it to your life to watch the work of a master like Bong Joon-Ho at his very best.  See it with a friend. Discuss it afterwards. Then see it again. You'll be glad you did."
기생충,Parasite,2019,2,,Whoever calls it a masterpiece just don't know meaning of masterpiece at all. I don't understand how this movie got oscar. It's just very normal average movie. Too much hype for this average movie.
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,Just WOW! What a movie I have just witnessed here! Thoroughly gripping right from the beginning to the end. My eyes were glued during the whole 132 minutes. I wouldn't be surprised if this movie wins the Oscars for best picture. No criticisms whatsoever. A Must Watch for everyone out there!!
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Finally watched the most talked film of the year, and now I realise why it is the most talked film of the year. Yes I'm talking about Parasite, Directed by Bong Joon Ho. One of the best thrillers I've seen. Now talking about the story, it was going straight in the first half and was wickedly funny and then suddenly the twist arrives and it'll grip you edge of your seat. After that you can't move from that seat, and at last only sad. This masterpiece is also technically brilliant. Cinematography by Kyung-pyo Hong is damm good for a gripping thriller. And the BGM, it's not like the natural thriller, but the violin and the piano playing is perfect with the situation. And of course the outstanding performance by the ensemble cast. At last the film speaks about the differences between the higher class and the lower class people and also says ""You know What kind of plan never fails?? No plan at all ""."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,Amazing Director Amazing cast Amazing performances One of the most mind blowing movies of the Decade Thank you Mr.Bong.Joon.Ho
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I can say that i did not expect that how one movie could affected me like that. All i can this movie is speechless. This is so original & real. This is real life, i am so sad to see that how can poor people and capitalism world can do this to any human being... and also the ''smell''... the best version to explain that how people can feel low, terrible. and how rich people can consider any human being like their slave in modern world. only the system can do this. this film is real because its showing the real world, capitalism and how the poor people can fearless about any other human being in order to get money from them. its scary but its real. this movie shows that you cant trust anyone."
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"To be frank on my first watch I didn't feel much great about the movie... But then I read, watched some videos and now I enjoy the movie very much... It's an artistic beauty... I guess for usual audience (like me) it's just an okay movie but we need to dig this movie deeper to enjoy it completely"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"There's quite a bit of hype around this film already, but going in I knew nothing about it. I prefer this, I rarely watch trailers for this very reason (the modern trend of giving too much away in trailers pisses me off). The opening is delightful, a young Korean family out of work and living in poverty, but looking out for one another, keeping positive and striving to help themselves. It's touching, heartwarming and even the slight squalor is beautifully shot. Good fortune finds it's way to them as the children begin tutoring jobs for a wealthy family living in the sort of show home that an episode of Grand Designs would die for. It's not until half an hour in, that this new hope gives way a little. Just a little crack, almost undetectable. What unfolds over the next two hours though is a masterpiece in tense deceit. I'm loathed to give too many details but suffice to say, this is a beautifully dark tale that reveals itself slowly and with such grace, it's nothing short of perfect. I don't think I can recall a film with such intense levels of humour and brazen deception built on the simplest of premises, desperation to survive. The plot, cast, cinematography, every damn facet, flawless. The deft twists of the characters as to who is good and who is bad, as the tension rises to unbelievable yet plausible levels is ridiculously gripping. Even the finale which after such mastery is bound to disappoint, does anything but. I know it's only January, but this surely has to be film of the year."
기생충,Parasite,2019,,,"Now this isn't a bad movie, not at all. Just so overhyped, which kinda ruined it with me. I feel like people like this just because it's so politically right, like what happened with black panther. Just because it's something you believe in doesn't mean it's good. I felt like it was way too long. And how did this get an Oscar over 1917, which is obviously superior especially in the visual category. I just don't understand why so many people like this mediocre film."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"Metascore 96, IMDb Top Rated Movies #26, higher than "" The Green Mile"", ""Léon"", ""The Usual Suspects"", ""C'era una volta il West"", ""Django Unchained"", ""The Shining"", ""A Clockwork Orange"", even ""2001: A Space Odyssey""... Oscars for Best Picture (first one ever for a film that's not in English), directing and screenplay and Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival... close to five hundred nominations and awards... I honestly don't get it.  The movie really is good, but in any of the categories I could possibly classify it, it wouldn't be at the top. I came across comments that the film successfully combines almost all genres. I don't know what they were watching, but I was watching a morbid drama about a ""con-artist"" family and social stratification. Comedy, thriller, horror, ... were we watching the same movie. And if someone asked me to recommend him a good South Korean movie, I don't think, in a few months, this one would even come to my mind at all. In a similar fashion, I would probably recommend ""Oldeuboi,"" which, although I saw it a couple of years ago and gave it a seven, I remember as I saw it yesterday. And regardless of the genre, the first association with a South Korean film would definitely be ""A Moment to Remember.""  I'm not saying it's not worth a look. Those who love well-shot sickness and modern South Korean cinema should definitely not miss it, but I certainly won't re-watch it.  And finally, one question - does the movie's title refer to the Kim family or the Park family ?! I think this is an interesting topic to think about. I guess the author meant poor fraudsters, but from my perspective, their employers are essentially bigger parasites.  7,5/10"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,Definitely the best movie of 2019. Everybody who loves cinema must see this film.
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,Absolute cinema perfection.This film is an emotional rollercoaster as a whole. It makes you connect with the characters and makes you hope but after a minute crushes your hopes and then makes you rebuild it..
기생충,Parasite,2019,5,,"Don't get all the fuss about this film, it is very average in every possible way. Started interesting but mid-way through it became boring and not compelling."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"WOW! I had no idea what to expect from this movie but it was fantastic! The acting was top-notch, there were laughs, dramatic moments, scary ones too. I was on the edge of my seat throughout the film. Don't Miss this brilliant movie!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"When you go in unexpected get ready to be hit in the head harder than you can imagine.The movie takes you in for a slow burn which gradually comforts you in its comedic and slice of life plot which then unfolds into an epidemic rollercoaster of twists and turns. I intially thought this would be a gore or hardcore thriller film but it's something ethereal, something you need to let sink in as the film takes jabs at the hardships and reality of both stratas of life. The methodically cinematography and the clever use of sound effects and music makes every scene a work of art. The plot refelects human nature and what limits we are ready to cross in order to make ourselves secure and ignore our inhibitions no matter the cost. 2019 couldn't end any better...."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Compelling characters, gripping plot, Parasite everything a movie should be. Stupefyingly unpredictable, it's remarkably refreshing and leaves you drop jawed at its conclusion."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Parasite is written and directed by Bong Joon Ho (Memories Of murder, The Host, Snowpiercer) and tells the story of a poor family living In Korea who take particular interest in a wealthy family as they slowly integrate themselves into there lives. Thats the basic/general premise for Parasite, and don't look anything else up about this movie beacuse make no mistake, this is a movie best experienced by knowing as little as possible, it also just so happens to be one of, if not the best movie of the entire year aswell as Bong Joon Ho's entire career.  Where to even begin with this one. Well let's start with the director himself. Ive always been a huge fan of Bong Joon Ho's. The Host is one of my favourite monster movies and Snowpiercer is a fun ride aswell, however it's Memories of Murder that really impressed me. A perfectly constructed crime thriller which put Ho on the map. Ho is a extremely ambitious and confident filmmaker who seems to be always trying something new with every movie he makes. One thing that always strikes me and many other fans of Bong's work is the overall tone of his films. Just like his previous work parasite is really difficult to place into just one genre. At times it extremely funny and playful, the next minute it will be an nail biting thriller with a hint of horror. Bongs writing style is something that I have always enjoyed but here in particular It works extremely well.  My favourite aspect of this movie (Besides basically everything) is the characters and the writing. Parasite is a movie that is examing social classes and showing the divide for what it truly is, in the film we see perspectives from both poor and rich families. With that in mind you may have some preconception of how these families are going to be shown based on what you have seen in the past. However you would be wrong. Ho manages to show both families with the same amount of respect as each other. His not trying to make the rich looks evil but at the same time not trying to make the poor look like saints. He is just showing human beings and the effect that these social class divides take on us. One thing that Bong Joon Ho said in the Q&A after the screening that struck me was: ""There are no Villains in this film"" and it's true. This all lends itself to a truly unique experience where you understand every characters motivations and understand the actions that they take, and in turn practically don't necessarily know who you want to come out on top.  Just go support this movie if you get the chance. Especially if you are a fan of film as an art form. Beacuse this truly is a masterful put together movie that from the second it starts to the end had me transfixed."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"This movie was spectacular.  I was hesitant to watch it because of the subtitles, but once the film got rolling the brilliant subtitles allowed the viewer to read them and look up and see the rest of the action for the scene.  This will win Best Foreign Film. It should also take home the Oscar for best film of the year. The cast was brilliant, the story was amazing, and the writer-director at the top of his craft.  (The trailer shows a scene where one of the actors speaks in English. Perhaps that was done for a fickle American audience, of which I admit to be a member. But except for 3 or 4 lines in English, the rest is in Korean. I can just see the Hollywood studios gearing up for an American version, with Margot Robie and Brad Pitt. But whatever they do, they won't be able to top this magical film and utterly astonishing film making.)"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Movie was class. Like very class. If you know what i mean? This was so class, imagine Robin Williams in Dead Poets Society. Class."
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"The film's story was excellent and the characters the director tried to convey were great, but he didn't deserve a Best Picture award. Acting in the movie was good especially for the rich wife. The angle and camera were excellent and the director in the film was excellent. In conclusion the film was accepted"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I made an Imdb account just so I could write this review. I watch a lot of films, typically one movie everyday and sometimes even two. Out of all the movies I watched, Schindler's List was my all time favourite. That film moved me in ways which no other film has managed to. I am a fan of Bong Joon Ho's work but none of his movies lingered in my mind with exception of "" memories of murder"", that film is a masterpiece. I watched Parasite at a local film festival and boy was I blown away by it. I have watched this movie more than 12 times and every time I watch it I discover something new about it. I just can't stop watching this film! No other film has had such a huge impact on me. Everything is just perfect. The story is unpredictable and extremely layered. Every shot has a visual subtext. The musical score is haunting to say the least. I fear that Bong Joon Ho won't be able to top this film and every movie that he makes after this will be compared to Parasite. I highly recommend everyone to watch this masterpiece."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"It is definitely not a bad movie, but i feel like it is hyped up way too much. The acting seems a little over the top a lot of the time. The message is pretty clear, but that does not make the movie stand out. Nice movie to pass some time, but in my opinion nit the masterpice a lot of people make it out to be. Maybe I didn't get the message or maybe it's just not that good"
기생충,Parasite,2019,2,,"So the movie won an oscar, was claimed to be a masterpiece and so on. Like most Oscar movies they are either really good or really bad. In this case the movie was highly overrated.  Ignoring the fact nothing that is done in the movie is logical or would actually work in real life, the movie doesn't seem to know what kind of movie it is. If movies have a twist or something you didn't expect, usually you are like ""Oh wow, that was amazing!"". But this left me confused. Alot of what happens makes the movie feel pointless. Obviously this is a spoiler free review, so I'll just say some movies have good guys and bad guys, not sure if the movie makers understood what that means in this.  The only reason I gave it two stars was it was South Koreas first movie to get an Oscar."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"A common factor between movie director greats such as Kubrick, Hitchcock, Wes Anderson, Tarantino and more are that they tend to make movies so unique that you cannot just categorize it into just one genre. Bong Joon Ho should be considered to join those greats on the list.  If I want to watch a movie with unique storytelling, powerful characters and unexpected twists, this is the director I go to. The only two memories that I have for Bong are Snowpiercer (one of the best sci-fi movies that is more than just a typical sci-fi movie) and Okja (among the best Netflix movies ever), but those are memories I cherish. Move along, you two, because Parasite not only knock those two aforementioned movies off as my best Bong movie, but it may be the best Korean movie I have ever watched.  The movie about two families of vastly different wealth gaps brought insight into the faults of our society, especially how we perceive the rich and poor. The poor Kim family needed to make ends meet found an opportunity when the son got a job opportunity to work as an English tutor at the rich Park family's daughter. That became a domino effect as one by one, each Kim family member schemed to work for the Park family through ingenious ways but not all was rosy as it seems.  I'll stop here as if I continue on, I will spoil the story. It has twists so shocking my jaw was on the floor multiple times without me realizing.  Parasite, just like other Bong movies, crosses over different genres with relative ease. It is a black comedy, a satire and a thriller all in one. To call it a ""Family Tragicomedy"" as what the trailer suggests is a gross understatement for what it is worth. It is not a tragedy. It is not a comedy. It is not even an amazing piece of art. No, it's a revolutionary masterpiece only Bong could make.  As for the other elements, the acting is sublime, the cinematography flawless and the dialogue humorous and realistic. I could not pinpoint a single flaw in the movie.  In conclusion, I was not surprised at all when Parasite beat Once Upon a Time in Hollywood for the Palme d'Or because after seeing it, I had nothing but praises for the movie. Worth seeing the movie more than once if you have the time to do so. Do not miss this movie at all (and bring along a cup of dry ram-don with optional sirloin steak, if you need to).  (Watched the movie at Cathay Cineleisure, 2 July 2019)"
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"'Parasite' is a South Korean family drama/black comedy, with some great acting and a unique premise. It doesn't take long to establish the characters, but does well to give us time to get to know them. It's essentially the tale of two families: the Kim's - Dad Ki-taek (Kang Ho), Mum (Hyae Jin), Son Ki-woo (Woo Shik) & Daughter Ki-jung (So Dam), and the Park's - Dad Dong-ik (Sun Kyun), Mum Yeon-kyo (Yeo Jeong), Son Da-song (Jung) & Daughter Da-hye (Ziso).  The Kim's are poor, living in the 'slums', when Ki-woo gets a job tutoring Da-hye at the Park's nice house on the other side of Seoul. Even though there's symmetry in the parents/son/daughter, this isn't an 'Us' scenario, but rather an exploration of class, social status and unconscious biases. There's no ""good guys"" or ""bad guys"" - just a semi-realistic depiction of one family seeing the greener grass on the other side and taking an unconventional approach to get there.  All of the actors are great, with a nice mix of fun and humour, with seriousness and desperation. The twist at the end of the second act is both unexpected and still poses a lot of questions - there's a few different ways it could've played out. Not quite a one-location film, but the house does serve as an extra character. Good score and cinematography. The ending is a fitting mix of bittersweet, devastating and hopeful."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,As a fan of Korean movies it's impossible for me to avoid various titles which leave me the feeling of adaptations from western and europe movies.  So far not disappointed Koreans knows how to spice things  Parasite (2019) Borgman (2013) 3-Iron (2004)
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"Thrilling and epic film, you wouldn't avoid feel overwhelmed of sensations watching this movie. I'm very surprised"
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"Parasite is also a person who uses others to obtain advantage without doing anything in exchange . parasite is about poor family who are trying to get job in rich families home ,the son (kim ki woo ) is english tutor and his sister (ki jung ) art therapist and their parents mother (chung sook ) housekeeper and father (ki-taek) is driver . they are poor family but want to get rich so they fool park family to get this job. parasite is a success story and also winning everyone's heart ,it is also a top prize cannes film festival and best foreign film in golden globes. director bong joon ho is his seventh film and its too good . this movie told us about the ugly , brutal modern life . when someone lives out in the open and others are forced to live in shadow but everyone sucking one another's blood. this movie of director boong joon ho called it ""satirical black comedy thriller movie""so parasite is stunning movie and all characters are wonderful actors."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,This was a wonderful film and I enjoyed absolutely everything about it. It's thought provoking and the story of a poor family wanting a better life isn't new but this particular concept is just amazing. I will be thinking about these people for a very long time. I can't wait to watch it all again. Loved it. Loved it. Loved it
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"Yep it's paranormal, Ordinary family and upper-class family how they approach the most of their points in life. Superb acting deserve a best foreign language award in Oscars 2020."
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"This is a class distinction based story full of allegory and plot twists. It's a drama, comedy, mystery all at once. Makes you question about right and wrong in a unique way. But it has also a darker side that makes you feel overwhelmed apart from the story itself. It may be the coloring of the movie."
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"Parasite is a film that brings together a plethora of genres that all coalesce effectively. But this is truly a story that has many layers and the shifting tones create an atmosphere that is both eerily terrifying as well as holistically captivating. If you like movies with social commentary, this one is for you. It is so good, With pitch perfect performances from the entire cast and the smartest script of the year.  It is a very strong contrast after 40 minutes of the story, to see the father of the family on the same scene , trying to save everything he has from his flooded house, while on the next scene, he has to pretend that everything is fine.  So when the later half begins we begin to wrestle with thoughts like the morality of the rich and poor families. Are the rich really evil do ignoring the poor? Does the poor have the right to fool and steal from them?  Finally, I think the description of all characters wants to show nobody is right or wrong. It's just the situations that makes us react the way we do."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Parasite is a one of the kind film, analyzing the relationships of power between people, social and economic classes and also between genres. The director was capable of camouflage such critics even within the urban landscape, creating political and social spaces that differ and are affected differently. There are subtle nuances of how climatic circumstances are seen and felt by the different spectrums of social classes. Parasite's narrative and visual language achieves a tremendous sensation on the spectator, a sensation of social verticality."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I tend to evaluate a film by the time it takes us to discuss about it afterwards. Parasite just premiered in Romania and we just returned home, but it's two hours since we keep on discussing it- enough to rate it with 10 stars- which happens very seldom, I must admit. I am no connoisseur of Korean films, so I am not entitled to place it here or there, nevertheless I am totally in control of my personal film hierarchy and Parasite sits high and mighty somewhere on top. Is it a satire, a comedy, a thriller, a social fresco, a mystery? It's all of them and then some. It kept me on the edge of my seat for all of its two hours. It was informative of Korean lifestyle. It was entertaining. It was gruesome. It was comic. It was satirical. It was endearing. It was never boring. Not only the actors are great in it, but the house itself deserves a place of its own in the cast. As a traveler around the world I sometimes found myself in neighbourhoods just like the ones in this film- both the favela style ones and the super rich ones. Every time I was wondering how such poverty and such richness can coexist peacefully. Not anymore, although for my peace of mind I hope not so dramatically. Parasite made me laugh, made me cringe, made me question life, gave me food for thought. What more should I expect from a film? To watch it again, clearly!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"The movie covers a variety of genres and social issues that rapidly developing countries like South Korea are facing, a sudden but unequal distribution of wealth, and inequality between classes. It revolves around a family of Grifters who feel they must take back power and exact revenge on a wealthy class family. The problem with the film is that it tends to drag out and become boring after a while. The viewer loses interest. The story could have been told in a much shorter time. It does tend to show what lengths people will go to if they feel they are the underdog, and what they are capable of doing to extract revenge."
기생충,Parasite,2019,2,,"Why this won best picture I will never know. The translation was horrible. Plot filled with holes, and so so acting."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,You Can't Call Yourself a Movie Maniac If you didn't Watch this Film.
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"This is the first time I can remember that a Korean-language film has been nominated for the Best Picture Oscar, and it is also nominated for Academy Awards in the International Feature (former Foreign Language Film), Original Screenplay, Production Design, Editing, and Director (Bong Joon Ho) categories as well. It is already the first Korean film to win the Palme d'Or at the Cannes film festival. This movie was funnier than I was expecting. Set in Seoul, it shows a poor family, the Kims, ingratiating themselves with a rich one, the Parks. The members of the rich family are actually quite decent, although somewhat condescending and gullible, and the Kims are likable rogues. The Kims, consisting of a father, mother, son, and daughter, live in a semi-basement apartment that looks out on an alley where drunks urinate. The father and mother are unemployed, the son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) has failed the entrance exam for the South Korean university system, and the daughter Ki-jung (Park So-dan) has failed to get into an art school. They fold pizza boxes for cash. When a friend (Park Seo Joon) tells Ki-woo that the Park teenage daughter Da-hye (Jung Ji-so) needs a tutor, Ki-woo applies for and, with the help of documents forged by his sister, gets the job. Then when he learns that the Park toddler son needs an art therapist for a recent traumatic event, Ki-woo recommends his sister, without disclosing that that she is his sister. (The traumatic event that the boy suffered becomes important later.) With the help of Google, she bluffs her way into obtaining the position. Then Ki-jung figures out how to get the Park family chauffeur fired, and the Kim father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) gets the job. Using the cook/housekeeper's (Lee Jung Eun) peach allergy, they manage to get her fired as well, and the Kim mother Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin) takes her place. By halfway through the film, the Parks are employing all four of the Kims without knowing that they are members of the same family. Complications ensue, of course, and there is a plot twist that I did not seek coming. As a social satire, this film is excellent, although the violent ending seemed incongruent with the rest of the film."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,Bong Joon-Ho did it again. A true masterpiece in acting and storytelling. You are hooked until the end of the story. Then you'll spend at least an hour after the credits thinking about it ! Avoid spoilers
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"South Korean film crews may be World Cinema's most painstakingly dedicated; the movies are detailed and creatively daring in ways that would be impermissible under Hollywood supervision, on top of letting the actors give their all and show their most unflattering selves. As is the case with Bong Joon-ho's Parasite, they might also produce some of our time's most impressively original stories and supply timely commentary in the process.  We meet the impoverished Kim family, father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho), mother Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin), son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik), and daughter Ki-jeong (Park So-dam), and we soon learn they aren't the most honest bunch. Ki-woo, through his friend Min-hyuk, gets hired as a homeschool English teacher, using forged Oxford documents, at the home of the upper-class Park family; tech company CEO Dong-ik (Lee Sun-kyun), his stressed-out wife Yeon-gyo (a wonderful Cho Yeo-jeong), teen daughter Da-hye (Jung Ji-so), and little Da-song (Jung Hyun-joon). This is but the beginning of the Kim family's sneaky ascent.  Learning of Da-song's troubles, Ki-woo, going by ""Kevin"", informs Mrs. Park of an art therapist he knows named ""Veronica"", who is actually Ki-jeong, who may help Da-song evolve. Through a series of events I won't spoil, ""Veronica"" later gets the chance to recommend a new chauffeur for the Park family in the form of Ki-taek, going by ""Mr. Kim"", who in turn recommends a new housekeeper, played by Chung-sook.  The way the Kims continually fool the Parks - from meticulous script recitations in their basement flat to ad-libbing based on research they've done for the fields they pretend to work in - is clever, tense, impossible to predict, and morbidly hilarious throughout. It is made even more amusing to behold thanks to how it's edited (for instance: cutting from Ki-taek lying to Yeon-gyo, to him finishing the same sentence during Ki-woo's rehearsals), how purposefully the staging and cinematography are done (the vast Park household juxtaposed against the cramped Kim residence), and how utterly believable these performances are.  The actors who portray the Kims, in particular, give remarkably layered performances. Each actor is required to play the character in their natural environment, plus the roles they themselves assume when posing as the Park family's home employees.  The characters themselves are convincing actors, hence their successful duping of the Parks, which makes each real-world actor's performance all the more considerable. And yes, it seems a bit unlikely that the Parks would fall for the scam and refrain from asking questions when each new employee of theirs happens to know someone suited for a very recently vacated position, but the film is self-aware and deliberate about this, not only because the Parks - in their carefree luxury - aren't the most observant.  This is all comical to experience, yes, but what Bong has to say about class inequity and - during the film's bleaker, later scenes - how it isn't necessarily so simple as letting the poor ""have some luxury"" for the sake of fairness, is what makes Parasite stick. We may understand the downtrodden Kims (we learn from a revelation that their desperation is not unique), and laugh at their conniving schemes, but are they truly Sherwoodian heroes in the end?  Parasite is generally well-loved, but divisive in the circles you'd expect. My guilty-pleasure film critic Armond White is certain that the film scoffs at nuclear families (also calling it a ""cancel-culture comedy"" because, I guess, anti-family sentiments are common amongst those who also like to ""cancel"" offensive celebrities and, indeed, berate classism). So far as I can decipher, White's main evidence is the fact that, in the story, a traditional and successful family suffers comically at the hands of the semi-titular social parasites - whom he likens to entitled modern Communists and AntiFa terrorists.  As mentioned, the Kims aren't strictly heroes or justified. Isn't this a bit like saying Midsommar seeks to paint Swedish tradition as perverse because it has characters (read: villains) who co-opt our customs perversely? But then, psh, who'd reason like that?"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,If you like Asian cinema and are curious about which movie to see before tonight's oscar ceremony then this movie is a must see. Despite being a Korean movie with subs it has a lot of excitement and drama to make it an upset at tonight's telecast.
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"It sickens me that there are people voting this film down strictly because they feel the Academy was attempting to be ""woke"".  Simply put, this is a stunning film that more than deserves every accolade it received and then some.  I haven't felt so passionate about a film in quite some time and I truly feel we are witnessing an all time classic being born  Bong Joon-ho delivered a masterpiece and we are privileged to see it. Kudos to the Academy for finally breaking the ridiculous void of not honoring any foreign language films for the top prize."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"Many plot holes, illogical scenes at times... i was hoping for a better plot twist, to be honest.."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Parasite' is absolutely fantastic. I'm still buzzing how good this movie is. This film is a milestone for Korean cinema. Just watch this with your own eyes. I can bet you will never forget this. I have never seen a film where one can present the deeply rooted social class boundaries not just in Asian countries but all over the world in such an entertaining and engaging way.  ""You know what kind of plan that never fails? No plan. No plan at all. You know why? Because life cannot be planned."""
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"I enjoyed this movie with all the twists and turns and surprises. It's worth watching and there is not a dull moment in it. I think this is GOOD film making, but not the best movie of the year.  I've heard others call this a movie about class structure. Yes, but in true Hollywood fashion, the rich people are generous and trusting if a little naive. The poor people are conniving criminals willing to take what is not theirs, or cheat and lie if given the opportunity.  Watch to be entertained. That's it. Don't read anything into it."
기생충,Parasite,2019,5,,What does this movie want to tell us? That the people living at the bottom have a tough life? That these people are evil and shameless? That they are continue to be like this as if THEY are the heroes? I can't believe this movie won 4 Oscars!
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"This is quite a tour de force, scooping up all the prizes in this award season (so far). It begins as a comedy of circumstance but takes a decided turn into some unexpected genres. The story is surprising and multi-layered. Your allegiances will shift throughout. The acting is superb. I give this film a 9 (superb) out of 10. {Comedy, Thriller, Drama}"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,This is my first experience with a Korean movie and I believe that I started with the best. This movie is amazing very simple but yet full of everything and all kinds of feelings the movie starts as a comedy it ends in a very dramatic way that you could never expect and the transition between the two phases was very smooth. The acting is very high level not a bit less than all A-list stars in Hollywood. Everybody must watch this movie.
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Like a five star dish, every minute of this film is superb, respecting the time it asks of you, the viewer, as it takes you through a roller coaster of highs and lows. It is not overly dramatic nor does deplete you emotionally, which is my typical fear with Korean dramas and thrillers. I must reiterate that you will not leave this movie with a sense of innocence lost, like your first reading of The Lord of the Flies or your first watching of Oldboy. The comedy cuts through the perfectly balanced two hours and change experience that Bong Jong Ho has prepared for you.  Avoid spoilers at all costs and dive in at the marvel of the story it can tell within two hours, as Hollywood struggles with two part films and making coherence out of overly packed blockbusters like Star Wars.  Perhaps a permanent entry into the Top 250 films of all time."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Unquestionably the best movie of the year and the best foreign movie I've ever seen. A complete rollercoaster ride . Laughter, anxiety and sadness, felt all in 2 hours. Cinematography was amazing specially for the flood secenes. Memories of murder was one of the greatest foreign films I've ever seen and Boon Joon-Ho has managed to make another masterpiece."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Synopsis: Kim Ki-woo lives on the edge of poverty with his family. They steal WiFi from their neighbors, work on minimum wage jobs and live in a basement apartment. Kim Ki-woo's life changes when he gets an offer from his friend to work as an English tutor, because the friend was going to study abroad. The friend is infatuated with the girl and wants his friend be around during his absence to avoid others being around his crush. The young man accepts the offer, changes his name to Kevin and starts tutoring Park Da-hye, who quickly falls in love with ""Kevin"". Once among the Parks, Kevin develops a different plan:he want to get his family into the Park family. Will he succeed to get his poor family into the Parks? If yes, will the Kims, the poor family, become as rich and privileged as the Parks? Parasite, by Bong Joon Ho, is the film of the year. It won the Palme d'Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival. Apart from its numerous accolades, Parasite won 4 awards at the 92nd Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best International Feature film. This is the first non-English language film to win Best Picture Award. It won as the Best Foreign Language Film at the 77th Golden Globe Awards. It won the Best Film Not in the English Language and the Best Original Screenplay awards at the 73rd British Academy Film Awards.  A bell sounds right at the beginning of the film is there to verify if all the speakers of the theater function properly or not. The bell is there to be compared to the plurality of voices a society produces. Like the bell, there are many others symbols in this film that deserve to be studies closely.  The food in the film often symbolizes the same notion of ""up and down"". The noodles, the cheaper food, are made for Kim family, while the beef, the expensive one, is for the Parks. The rain in the film plays the same role as the food. It emphasizes the opposite perceptions that individuals from two different social classes have about the same thing and how that same thing influences them differently. Water symbolizes the reality and the stone symbolizes false hopes. Water always goes down and not up and can damage those who live ""down"", the poor. This was the case when the strong rain came and damage the Kims' house.  Parasite foreshadowing: the scene, where the fumigation happens, the daughter attempts to close the window, but the father tells not to, because it is a ""free extermination"". Everyone starts coughing, except from the father. During another occasion, the daughter says that she fit in well with the Parks, but ironically she is the first to die. When it comes to the father, he is the only one to continue his life in the basement, just like he was the only one, who was not afraid of the smoke. When it comes to the Indian theme, it is a foreshadowing for the fate of the Parks family. Bong Joon-ho doesn't portray the rich as villains neither the poor as victims. The borderline between the bad and the good is opaque: we do not know for which character we should cultivate the most empathy. Deep down, they may all have the same insecurities and worldview with very slight differences...apart from the smell..., because ""they all smell the same"" according to the Parks. Is it because of the subway, or the soap they use, or the basement smell? It is just a metaphor: the smell symbolizes the poor. By the way, during birthday festivities, the father of the Parks family is killed by the father of the Kims family following his disgust towards the smell of their first housekeeper's husband. One of the highly used symbols is the concept of ""up and down"" or ""high and low"" for class representation. Parks' house is located at the highest point of the town. The upper-class family of Parks rarely looks down on the floor. They always look forward or up, which means that their house's employees hide easily under their tables, in the ground-floor or elsewhere if/when they feel that hiding is necessary. The notion of ""parasite"" is recurrent and questions what exactly it means. Who exactly is ""parasite"": the poor or the rich. Are there any parasites? What if everybody are parasites? One of the most important points of this film is the fact that people fight against each other. Even those, who are down, fight mercilessly for keeping their place in the Parks's house even if it means living in the basement. They lack a lot of solidarity.  Parks' son has an obsession with native Americans. For his birthday, the native american theme is highly used. It represents a surprise: just like the Kims discover that there is a family living rights in the basement of the Parks's house, the Europeans had discovered that there were native Americans living in the newly discovered continent. In both cases the result was the war and/or the fight. Moreover, during the festivities, Kim Ki-woo checks if the other family's father is in the basement taking the stone, which was given to him by his friend as a symbol of success, symbolizing the hope for a better future, with him. The stone is only used to smash someone's head and never brings success. The closing scene shows Kim Ki-woo. In his letter to his father, Kim Ki-woo says that he will work until he could afford to buy the mansion and adds:""All you'll need to do is to walk up the stairs"". These expressions summarizes the myth of social mobility and supports social determinism."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Bong joon ho gives you everything in this movie. Laughs, Suspense, Disgust, Empathy, Shock and Hope. The message is so woven into the film and subtle. Hardly a flaw in the film. The film does not talk down to it's audience and presents characters who are not your stereotypical rich and poor. The movie makes you think, a deep long think. The runtime of 132 mins is hardly noticeable in this fast faced storytelling with a crisp screenplay. Bong Joon Ho is hands down one of the best directors of our times. Deserves all the accolades it has been garnering."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Out of 814 movies that I rated on this site, I only gave 9 of them the full 10/10 and this movie is one of them, so you go figure."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"I watched ""Parasite"" a Korean film last night. I have been hearing how great this movie is and how IMDB rating is 8.5 IGN 9.5 Rotten Tomatoes giving it 100%. Well, am I missing something? I do think it's a good film but almost a perfect 10 I don't feel that. The actions of the main family seems so realist. The story, the way it's written, and just the performance of the actors is good. You can imagine that something like this can maybe happen to people that is just gullible. But I felt like everything was very predictable. But some questions were unanswered Like, Why was the original house keeper (Moon-gwang) face messed up? Why the little boy (Park Da-song) have special sense in smell with all of them and Why was he so wild in the beginning and calm and good later on? Why did the father (Kim Ki-taek) have an odor that smells so bad that it couldn't be disguised or washed off? I do like the Director (Joon-ho Bong) and other films he had made but I just feel like this movie is more a 6.5 / 7 for me."
기생충,Parasite,2019,1,,"I am sorry, I didn't like it...It could have been great, the topics were valid, but it was just not good. I don't think it was a masterpiece, at the end it was all over the place and you missed the point. The story was not good either. I have to disagree with the rest of the world."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,Parasite is good movie of the year. What a story plot and execution was so nice.
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"Palme d'Or winner Parasite is a masterpiece by Bong Joon Ho. That movie is so skilled. Screenplay is amazing, I think it is best original screenplay of 2019 next to Knives Out. It takes you inside of it at the beginning and then you can never leave. Cast made an incredible job. Actually I can't find any bad things to say about Parasite. It is great."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,This is a great Korean little gem. The storyline is simply amazing and I suggest not read anything before you watch it. I did it and I have enjoyed every single minute of the movie. Best plan is not having one.
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"This time I watched it in theatre with very annoying crowd. They laughed all the time but the reaction to second half of the movies was priceless (everyone was like wtf is happening). Oscars not nominating Kang-ho Song for best supporting actor is a disgrace. Also, it deserved at least cinematography nomination but whatever."
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"The Oscar fever has started and it is my favourite time of the year where I get to watch the films which is engaging, clap-worthy, entertaining and relatable. Parasite was already in buzz for sometime which caught my attention and to my surprise turned out to better than expected after seeing it.  Parasite tells the story of differences in the mindset between the Upper class and Lower class families which is very much existing in our society. As the name of the film itself, the movie gives a detailed account of how an unemployed family is influenced by the lifestyle of a wealthy rich family and eventually enters into their house only to get the shock of their life.  Directed by Bong Joon Ho, who made Snowpiercer and Okja, Parasite boast off characters which you can easily relate to. A poverty driven family comprising of a struggling father, Kim, and mother, tech savvy son and a careless sister - who goes the wrong path to enter the house of a rich family but ultimately face the consequences. The film slowly and eventually picks up as each member from the poor family starts getting the job in the house of rich, by falsely accusing the old staffs. The main drama unfolds when the rich guys go for a vacation and the Kim's family take over the house and celebrate their win. However, they meet with an unfortunate incident when one of the old staff comes back which changes their plan completely. This is where the film kicks-off when the rich guys cut short their trip and plan to come back which leads to series of uninvited events, leading to more excitement and thrills you never expected.  If you go the wrong way, you have to face the consequence and that is what the director Bong Joon Ho showed in his film when Kim's loses one of his family member and ultimately face the redemption. Hats of to Bong Joon Ho for creating a beautiful drama with relatable characters, humorous situations and a powerful storyline with a strong message. There are couple of scenes which is executed brilliantly - when two staff families meet at the basement, the flood scene depicting the behavior of Kim's family - Kim picking up in stuff, son grabbing his favourite stone and daughter lighting her cigeratte even though the house is in mess. The beauty of cinema lies in the story-telling and this is where Parasite scores.  Technically, Parasite has a wonderful background score with lovely cinematography. Editing is superb, though I felt few scenes could have been trimmed. Art direction is brilliant while dialogues are outstanding. Performances wise - I felt all the actors played their part while but if I had to pick up, my favourite would be Kang-ho Song, who plays the role of father of the unemployed family.  Parasite is nail-biting and intense thriller that is going to give you goose bumps. Brilliant 4/5"
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"An impoverished family finds ways to worm themselves into a wealthy household, until an unexpected turn of events throws their plans into disorder.  _________  Parasite is the best Korean film I've seen for quite awhile, though it's not without its flaws. Even allowing for poor translation, a good deal of the dialogue is weak and hard to follow, several plot threads are introduced that don't go anywhere or end up being satisfactorily explained, and too many elements (the morse code, for instance) stretch credulity and feel crowbarred in because they are necessary for the story the makers want to tell, rather than making any sense *within* that story.  But for all that, Parasite reminds me of everything that is so great and different about Korean cinema: a twisted, amoral, mischevious inventiveness, interspersing thoroughly leftfield turns with out-of-nowhere snatches of shocking and perfectly choreographed violence that make you involuntarily laugh out loud in both horror and admiration (in this instance, at a kick down some stairs). I honestly never saw the twist in this one coming at all, and it's a doozy, taking the film in an entirely different direction to what I'd been expecting.  Though not as great as its accompanying hype is saying, Parasite is still one of the most original and enjoyable films this year and definitely worth a look."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"For shure it's a good movie. The production is great ( visual, audio, cut). But the story started great and end up a little flat. Also the critic about capitalism could be sharper."

기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"When people think of a parasite, they obviously associate it with a lesser living creature living off of its larger, more prosperous host. For example, fleas live on dogs and consume their blood.  According to society, which is constructed in a way that the most educated are burdened with defining the meaning of words, a parasite is a person who consumes resources off of another without returning anything. At least so it says, right?  Well, what if an economic recession hits and people lose their jobs and no longer have a way of making the money they need to in order to repay whoever it is they are working for? What if they experience an illness, injury, or health problem (in addition to that bad economic situation) which deems them unable to even work productively (at least for a while)? What if the ""host"" that the so-called ""parasite"" human is borrowing resources from is actually a ""bad person"" themselves who ""abuses"" them both emotionally, verbally, and physically in order to boost their ""egos"" to make themselves feel superior to the person they are ""helping""?....Is there actually a parasitic human, or are all people just human?  Take for instance someone who is born into poverty, physically or mental abuse, or both. Are they parasites just because of this? Things they had no control over? Just because they are poor? What if this person decides to not make excuses and gets a job, but a recession hits that causes them to lose their job? Were they not a parasite before but now after they lose their job, which they cannot help, they are now?  Perhaps most complexly, what if they people ""at the top"" are actually the ""Parasites""? (if there was one). Isn't it true that government workers and ""politicians"" live off of ""taxpayer money"" (aka taxpayer labor)? Isn't it true that a mega-rich corporate leader consumes the labor of their subordinates in order to make exponentially more money off of them?  Doesn't this luxurious CEO or executive ""suck the blood"" and ""life"" out of their workers by forcing them to work harder, work overtime, sometimes work 60 hours a week or more (with the threat they will be demoted or lose their jobs if they do not)? And isn't it true that due to increase production or productivity, the executive makes even more money on the backs of their employees? Furthermore, cannot the corporation hold onto the laborers' paychecks for at least 2 weeks in order to reinvest it in stocks before paying it out to those who earned it two weeks prior as they wait for their paychecks?  Many years ago, a very startling and eye opening book came out which actually compared corporations to psychopaths. All of the traits in an empirical psychopath are parallel to exactly how corporations are run, and also how corporate executives operate: they callously mistreat their employees, can care less about their health or well being as long as they are greedily and selfishly getting wealthier and growing. As a corporation becomes bigger, the dichotomy between caring for a small group of employees and eventually becoming indifferent to any humanity and well being of the individuals (which also includes the customers) becomes starker in contrast. All that matters is personal selfish gain in an overabundance unnecessary amount of riches, as their employees struggle to pay their bills each pay period and have to wait two weeks often times for their checks. If they lay people off or if the corporation downsizes or relocates, then the employees are back to barely getting by with no check.  So the question again must be asked: who ""really"" is the Parasite? Either there are none, or everyone is."
기생충,Parasite,2019,2,,"It's overrated, it doesn't deserve to be in 250 at all, nor does it deserve to be higher rated than 6. There is no point, the first few minutes are funny, then predictable. You will be waiting for something to happen to justify that above 8 rating and show why it's on 250, but nothing happens. It is entertaining a bit"
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"Watched on a flight after the Oscars. Curious. It starts slow, there are subtitles, but you are quickly adapted to the the films rhythym. I know nothing of this culture but it is a story of humans The loyalty and love we share in our family. Choices are made, levers tripped, situations develop... Both families are endearing. There are some light and humorous scenes. There are also a few 'oh come on' risks akin to a sitcom, but that's how we get from there to 'holy crap what is happening here' so must take that leap with the director. The cinematography is beautiful, the pace is good but you need to pay attention. the dialogue is all valuable- When we get to the last third, it all comes together quickly. Enjoy the ride. You haven't seen a film like this before"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Director Bong Joon-ho, the wildly innovative foreign director behind ""Snowpiercer"" and ""Okja"" has outdone himself with ""Parasite""- An original and profound look at class warfare that among many things is meticulously crafted, seamlessly blends drama and dark humor with several of the best performances I've seen all year.  If you can get past that this isn't spoken in English, fellow film fans will be in for a real treat come awards season (or whenever it comes to streaming, because missing this would be a crime).  This may just be favorite movie of the year, depending on after I see ""The Irishman"". Review for that coming soon!    Grade- A+"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"If there's an argument that's been a part of society since the dawn of time is that of class. From the days of cavemen, the Roman Empire, the Enlightment, and even modern times, philosophers, scholars and storytellers have explored the ideology of the wealthy and poor. It's something that people have wanted to fix to create more equality and people that discuss whether things should be equal at all. It's hard to give my opinion because we have so many viewpoints that's its challenging to paint who exactly is in the wrong. There are good wealthy people and bad poor people and vice versa. This is also something that many movies has dived into.  In fact, one of my favorite movies of the 2000's is the science-fiction thriller, Snowpiercer. It was a creative way to look at corrupted societies and how it unfavorably placed the poor without a way out. It's a movie with a lot of layers and Korean director Boon Joon-Ho knew it was important to make it just as entertaining as it was to explore and read into. It looks like he's made another movie about class, except Parasite is a smaller story about two families, but is still as impactful.  We start with a family of four living in the slums, in a basement under a store; father Kim Ki-Taek (played by Song Kang-ho), mother Chung-sook (played by Jang Hye-jin), son Kim Ki-woo (played by Choi Woo-shik) and daughter Kim Ki-Jeong (played by Park So-dam). They struggle for work enough that they take jobs constructing pizza boxes. When a friend of the son comes to visit, he offers Kim Ki-woo an English tutoring job to a wealthy family's daughter. He accepts and sees a world he only dreamt of; a fancy house built by a famous architect, wide space, a backyard and nice cars.  After some convincing from the family, a scheme is made so that the daughter is hired as an art therapist for the youngest son, the father as a new driver/errand runner, and the mother as the new housekeeper. The family is overjoyed that their con has fooled the other family. This leads into them celebrating when the other family leaves for a camping trip by eating and drinking in the living room. Things go wrong when the previous housekeeper returns to get something.  Though there is a second half to the movie, I can't talk about it without spoiling it. Parasite is one of those movies that spans a lot of genres, and yet keeps it focused enough to make it one of the best movies of 2019. It may sound like a typical dark comedy, but because the character development focuses on all four members of the family, it allowed the story to go in a variety of directions that I didn't expect. At the front, this is still a story on class difference. A lot of these movies will revolve around the theme of ""helping the poor"". Thankfully, Parasite is a smarter movie and tries something different.  Parasite doesn't try to make the wealthy family out to be villains. But they don't try to paint the main family in a complete positive light either. These are all grey characters that are simply living life and the lengths their going to climb up. This could mean conning themselves into good jobs or getting a party together for a child. If anything, it tries to lean into how stabbing others in the back to get what they want is bad, but even that can depend on a number of factors. This movie is the prime example of ""would you steal a loaf of bread to feed a starving family"".  Not only is the movie written and directed beautifully, but it's acted amazingly. Though the movie is in Korean, you can tell the actors are still giving it their all as they each understand the complexities of their situation and why each one would make the decisions they make. This also remains one of the better ensemble pieces I've seen this year, hence why I'm not naming them one by one. I noticed this as well in Snowpiercer with how Bong Joon-ho knows how to cast as a whole and work with what he has.  I'll give this ten fancy houses out of ten. It may be in a different language, but this is already one of my favorite movies of the year. This is the kind of movie that can be hard to describe, but my best bet is to simply tell others to see it. I feel like that even talking about it a little could ruin it. Check it out and see just how complicated class difference really is."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I'm going to put it simply: There's not a single thing this film does wrong.  The comedy is on point. The drama is on point. The moments of tension are on point. The commentary on social class is on point. Acting, writing, filmmaking - on point.  Parasite totally deserved the Palme D'Or and I want this to win all the Oscars, all the Golden Globes, and any other awards it gets nominated for because everything in this s**t was incredibly on point.  Parasite is nothing short of a MASTERPIECE."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Parasite is such a fantastic movie that even its comparison with other amazing works can be dangerous. Korean director Bong Joon-ho has such control over the narrative and the camera that we often feel in a Hitchcock or Tarantino movie or even Italian neorealism. And it all flows smoothly.  The film begins as a custom comedy. Kim Ki-woo's family (Choi Woo-sik) lives so far below the poverty line in Korean society, that resides in a basement. They're always trying to capture wifi signals from surface neighbors, or leaving the windows open to benefit from the plagues fumigation made by the city hall on the streets.  The boy's life experiences a turnaround when a friend who is taking a trip abroad indicates him as a tutor to a girl he is teaching English. The friend is in love with the girl and trusts Kim, who knows why, to keep her safe.  Changing his name to Kevin, the boy begins his classes at the magnificent home of the fancy family, and, as expected, the girl Park Da-hye (Jung Ziso) soon falls in love with him. But your dream is much more ambitious: getting a job for your whole family in the house.  First, he convinces the girl's mother Yeon-kyo (Jo Yeo-jeong in great acting) to hire an art psychologist named Jessica, actually her sister Ki-jung (Park So-dam) for the hyperactive younger son. Using tricks, the Kim family's father and mother are soon admitted to the house. And on a Parks trip, they celebrate at their ""new"" residence.  After that apparent happy ending, everything changes in the movie. Former housekeeper Moon-gwang (Jeong-eun Lee) returns home and brings with her a great secret hidden until then. The outbreak of this surprise causes scenes worthy of a thriller, which only ends with the unexpected return of the Parks. What follows are comical scenes and amenities, until the terrible birthday of little boy Da-son (Hyun-jun Jung).  From there, chaos, destruction, and despair. And an ending. Or would it be two?"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Maybe it's just me, but I have known a decline in film quality since 2017. 2016 was a very good year for film--the last great year altogether. Have I simply seen too many films? In 2016 and earlier, There were a whole bunch of films that I could say ""now that is one of the very best films I have ever seen."" Since 2017, the most that I could say about I film I love would have been ""I love this film. But I don't adore it...One of the best of the year, not ever."" Finally near the end of the decade comes a film I can comfortably say is one of the finest motion pictures I have ever laid eyes on.  The movie is Korean so there are subtitles and it does run over two hours. But throughout that duration, time stands still. We are fully immersed in this tale of Shakespearean portions and Hitchcockian brains.  'Parasite' follows two families: the dirt poor Kims and the filthy rich Parks. Being on opposite ends of the social spectrum, many people interpret this as a social satirical film. I can see where they are coming from, but I didn't care about that. Many different themes such as identity are also looked at, but that is all just icing on the cake. Placing them on opposite ends of the spectrum just makes the story and characters another relationships all the more great.  it is sad seeing the Kims in such bad living conditions, so we root for them right away to get out of the slums. Ki-woo is the son who aspires to get out of poverty by attending university. He is approached by one of his university friends who is going overseas to study to take over tutoring Park Da-hye in english. Ki-woo does not know English well, but figures he can fake it and make some money. he may be just a tutor, but it pays well. He finds out that the Parks are looking for a therapist for their son, so Ki-woo gets his sister to assume a new identity and be the boy's therapist. With more money coming and only two more people in the Kim family in need of a good job, it all seems like a sinch to get them in. But getting rid of people in their way and keeping their true identities under wraps from the Parks will be harder than they could fathom.  'Parasite' could be simplified as ""family vs family"" but there are a couple of more characters other than the regular family members that are all so interesting. Most movies cannot handle developing these many characters. They are smart, sympathetic, even likeable.  The reason I call this film ""Hitchcockian"" is because of its power to thrill us and take the viewer to places they could never imagine. Even when a movie is unpredictable, the payoffs are plausible and the viewer is able to tie things together easily. But with this, each time a twist comes (which is frequent) the viewer is still left flabbergasted and completely caught off guard. The director really pulls out the rug from underneath.  Watching this movie was such a breath of fresh air and director, Bong Joon-Ho could easily have messed up at any moment. But there is not one second of wasted or subpar material. In fact, it it just the opposite: the movie keeps building and just gets better by the minute. The thrills get stronger and stronger as the twists get smarter and more intricate. With all that happens 'Parasite' becomes an imservie film experience that you will never forget.  4/4"
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,Average movie and I still don't get it how this movie won the academy award for the best motion picture of the year. It felt like it would never end.
기생충,Parasite,2019,2,,"The opposite of a singer who sings with soul is a singer who sings *as if* they have soul. This movie was done *as if* it were a satire, *as if* it were making a statement, *as if* it has a deeper meaning. Instead, it's hollow at its core, mean-spirited, and pointless. It's a film for those like the idea of making a point but not having to suffer any uncomfortable truths.  The only good effect of this film is that it exposes the vacuity of those who praise it and their self-delusion. It's a barometer of the public's appetite for garbage. See this film only in the context of a sociology experiment and be shocked at how far we've fallen in our gullibility and how desperate we are not to face ourselves."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Just the rest of the world, and the academy, catching up with what my husband and I have known for years: Korean writers are absolute masters at plot twists and characterization! If you don't agree, watch a few more Korean movies to get adjusted to the cultural differences, and you'll see."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Bong Joo Ho has been making ingenious social commentary for some time. That is not new. But this film reaches new heights, not through more extravagant plot but through a more naturalistic approach. As a result, the comedy, the stakes, and the insights here are at a different level. You care about the protagonists, and you feel the weight of their struggle. All the same ingredients are there (the social satire, the violence, the bizarre twists, the brilliant direction), but there's a new weight to this film. I don't think ""masterpiece"" is too strong, and I'm looking forward to watching it again some time soon."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Movie starts off with a very intimate portrayal of the poverty and the vigor of the first family. Mastery is very evident.  The rich family is portrayed next with just as much intimacy and depth.  The story starts unfolding, the deviousness is a bit disturbing when it begins. Intimate portrayal is about showing everything, not just the stuff that gets the audience to like the protagonists. Bong Joon Ho is ruthless in his script and making.  The excesses of the rich is contrasted sharply with the abysses of the poor.  There is so much to this movie that the various departments of the movie like cinematography, music etc don't make it to the plane of consideration on the review table. Shocking movie. Must watch. Amazing content, amazing execution!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"This film had me hooked from the beginning. A fast-paced, and well thought out storyline. No details were left unanswered in my eyes. Brilliant and humble acting from all the cast with believable characteristics and flaws. The subtitles throughout are worth it for what is unveiled during the film."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"This film is extremely engaging and gripping. The way the film switches it's genre was marvelous. Direction, Story and Acting have been mastered. These films require their due recognition. Truly a masterpiece"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"It is always exciting to see what the Frenchies decided was film of the year as it never fails to be a better pic than whatever the Hollywood menagerie showers with a critical accolades come Springtime. Little did I expect Cannes Film Festival to award the prestigious Palme D'or this year to a director who has been one of my least favorite filmmakers...until now. Bong Joon-ho's English film debut, 2013's SNOWPIERCER, struck me as overrated and dumb while 2017's OKJA was cartoonish and ham-fisted. It didn't help that he'd relegated two of my favorite actors, Tilda Swinton and Jake Gyllenhaal, to cringe-inducing career-low sideshow performers. Besides that, I just couldn't vibe with his grotesque and bumbling concoction of family-friendly cuteness, ultra violence, and quirky humor. It reeked of trying too hard and failed to land with me at every turn. With that said, let me be the first and most surprised person to say with no reservations PARASITE is easily one of the best movies I've seen this year. However, there's the other genetically engineered super pig in the room: PARASITE has an awful lot in common with last year's Palme D'or winner SHOPLIFTERS. Putting aside that the former is a Korean production and the latter was Japanese, both films follow the lives of a poor family as they struggle on the fringes of society, running cons and scams to get by in a callous world. They are held together by their honest love for one another, and their example is set juxtaposed to the neglectfulness of a consumerist society that allows so many to fall through the cracks in the first place. But the main way that Joon-ho one-up's his award-winning predecessor is with an incisive sense of humor suffused in each character, a humor that is immediately, physically translatable despite the language barrier. It works here so well precisely because it's reigned in and understated throughout the film, making the more manic parts hit harder - such as when Park So-Dam apathetically lights a cigarette on a lidded toilet spewing flooded sewage out the sides. The class conscious themes that have pervaded Joon-ho's science fiction offerings up to this point are given a much greater sense of immediacy and relatability as we watch this struggling family elbow their way into the good graces of a rich, privileged, and naive family. Beside the obvious ""haves vs. have-nots"" one would expect from this scenario, there's clearly an exploration of the structures that relegate people into servitude and poverty for generations, not just by the wealthy elite but by the pervasive mechanisms of misfortune that are maintained by the working class as we claw at each other's throats for short-term gain. Believe the hype, PARASITE is well deserving of the praise it has received thus far. It's tense, hilarious, and poignant, and I'm forced to genuinely re-evaluate this director's output knowing that he knocked it out of the park this time."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"This is a very good movie, but not a masterpiece. I really like the story and the actors were pretty good. I would never expect this film to win an Oscar. I guess the politics has entered the Oscars for good. I understand that many will not agree with me, but this is my personal opinion."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,Easily the best film of 2019. Potential winner of best movie at the Oscars!
기생충,Parasite,2019,5,,Story line is good but not something new. Screen play little slow at times. Acting is not that great.
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"Rooting for an impoverished but resourceful underdog struggling to make ends meet, sets up a standard feel good movie scenario. Seemingly innocuous, ""Parasite"" captures the lively trials of the Kim family as they scheme and trick their way into cushy employment, starting an invasion of sorts. The web of lies in an escalating con targeting the insensitive and gullible Park family opens a series of mouth watering doors, but alas, there's always some that should remain shut.  Whether it's borders, classes, or smells, everyone has a line, that once crossed, destroys most semblance of rationale. ""Parasite"" brilliantly dissects how these boundaries (however personal and subjective) are developed within our very complicated and unique species.  Filmed almost exclusively within the two families' domiciles, one a filthy, cramped basement apartment, the other a glorious, spacious and meticulously spotless mansion on the hill, ""Parasite"" offers an obvious and very deep class chasm as plot kindling.  Delicious absurdist touches like peach fuzz allergies, hammer throw expertise, American Indian infatuations, and wifi signal hunting, are peppered throughout offering much welcomed distraction. Spinning an endearing class dichotomy comedy wildly out of control adds white knuckle power to the jarring second act. Sides are drawn early on, making it is easy to cheer for the bottom feeders in this warfare, but not everything on screen is black and white. The consequence of action and reaction during the increasingly muddied grey areas powers this film. What is good? What is evil? How is that line drawn?  Sneaky, powerful, perfectly paced, funny, shocking, and quite wonderful. Can a film be both dark and bright? Yes, yes it can."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"PARASITE impressed me enough that I wanted to see it again. Having done so, I've increased my initial 9 rating to a full 10.  What I thought were plot holes turned out to have simple explanations that I had missed in my initial viewing. And with the element of surprise gone, I could more fully concentrate on the characters and their motives. I especially liked that no one here is 100% blameless or 100% evil. That kind of moral ambiguity is common in everyday life. I only wish it were more common in movies.  This time, I also paid much closer attention to the film's abundant symbolism. Admittedly, though, I still couldn't figure out the significance of the Scholar's Rock. But that says more about me than it does about this magnificently brilliant film.  If not the for THE IRISHMAN, I would root for PARASITE as this year's Best Picture winner. Still, it's a shoo-in for Best Foreign Language Film."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Bong Joon-ho is a South Korean filmmaker with a very diverse filmography and one who brings a distinct reputation with him when releasing a film, the Bong Hive being the name of his devoted fanbase. His latest film, Parasite, gets a long awaited release in the UK and going into this one blind is one of the best decisions you could ever make.  All unemployed, Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) and his family take peculiar interest in the wealthy and glamorous Parks, as they ingratiate themselves into their lives and get entangled in an unexpected incident.  Parasite is an absolute triumph from Bong Joon-ho, his film building and building to a crescendo that I didn't see coming at all. It's a brilliantly written film, the humour running through the social commentary of class separation often genius throughout and the dark humour that takes things to the next level utterly breathtaking. There's a real intricacy to the screenplay, co-written by Bong and Han Jin-won, taking time to introduce us to the characters in such a way it makes what unfolds even more hard-hitting.  It isn't just the screenplay that deserves special mention for its intricacy, the production design on Parasite providing a stunning backdrop for the narrative to unfold. The time and effort that goes into making something as wonderful as the Park's family home always amazes me and it pays off majorly with its maze-like features almost serving as a character itself. Hong Kyung-pyo's sweeping cinematography through the narrow corridors and lower-class neighbourhood where the Kims actually live is beautifully neat and Yang Jin-mo's score accompanies the film with a wonderfully symphonic prowess.  Coming to the performances, Parasite is full of great performances from a cast who have been nothing but infectious this awards season. It's very much an ensemble piece, each of them getting their moment to showcase their talents but the stand-outs for me were Song Kang-ho, Park So-dam and Cho Yeo-jeong.  Parasite is Bong Joon-ho's magnum opus and has set an incredibly high bar for the rest of 2020 in film to live up to. I haven't been as fully engrossed in a film as I was watching this masterpiece unfold and I can only imagine it's going to get better with each viewing."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"What is Parasite - A Satire? Sarcasm, humor, emotion, human condition, suspense, thriller, social issues, drama, thought provoking dialogues, strong and smooth acting - all ingredients cooked with utmost perfection and balance and served with elegance and style.  It is an unconventional storytelling, it may look very simple and everyone might watch and love this film but it has layers of strong and complex structure and an extraordinary artistic flavor. The beauty of cinema lies in its frame, because that's the window through which we watch and experience the story. And that's where comes the cinematography and the production design, it has a rich and subtle tone with detail level precision , every frame, every shot is unforgettable. Another unconventional part of this movie is it's background score, we hear operatic music during a slow motion chaos. May be the background score is inspired from Hitchcock movies.  This film and the characters do not leave you after you finish watching, it stays with you, even if you want you can't escape from them, then slowly you learn to live with them in your head, because you are also one of them. It is a hypnotic movie which is disturbing but you will still want to watch it again and again, probably because you want to laugh, cry and get scared - all at the same time.  Parasite touches so many corners of human emotions without trying too hard to over amplify any scene or sequence. Kudos to Director Bong Joon-ho for his visionary approach to tell a story which is not unknown to anyone, forcing us to believe that we are very much part of this cruel world."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Yesterday, at around the beginning of the third act, I 'came to' and realized that this film had hooked my complete attention; then, at the roll of the credits, I had so many thoughts that were provoked by nearly every shot of this movie-laughing and awe-struck by what I'd just experienced. It had been a long time since a movie had given this effect, and it's original films like this that come out of nowhere every once-in-awhile. And today, I know for sure I have to write down my thoughts about this new surprise hidden gem, Parasite, because it truly deserves to be called a masterpiece. This is my first, and most definitely not my last, foreign film to make this list of the greatest. I'm so thrilled that I was motivated to go see this as it has pushed my boundaries of what I thought makes a movie great. Bong Joon Ho has delivered a flawless comical satire that focuses on real issues of the divisions of social classes that are present in every society-so it is not just relatable to Koreans. The genres that can be attached to the movie are numerous since it has bits of comedy, drama, suspense and even thriller aspects that all perfectly interweave together to hold your focus until the very end. It is both moving and thought-provoking, but is also a movie I'd recommend to anyone at any age or stage in their life. It is an all-around masterful original piece of cinema which makes for a very fun time at the movies. Adding to the greatness of the film is the performances from the entire cast. A great ensemble of talented actors-including Ho's long time collaborator Kang-ho Song-make watching every character on screen a moment not to miss. When there is so much chemistry within an on-screen family, you know that the acting is superb to a point at which you forget you are watching a fictional story. You just sympathize with each character because you understand how their actions are driven. Intertextuality is big in this film and makes a second viewing necessary and welcomed. I could watch this movie over and over and find many more hidden aspects that further prove how much thought and time went into crafting it. Bong Joon Ho has my pick for directing and this film for best foreign, possibly best overall. Inspiring to both film enthusiasts and to the everyday human being-this one is very monumental to foreign cinema since it leaves you having a different perspective on the industry. It warns us not to overlook nor disregard a movie simply because we don't like reading subtitles. -TE (11.10.19)"
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,Inspite of movie it was more of a experience and a great one.. So much genres in a single movie and all of them are completely justified with the characters and dialogues...
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"Comparing the nominees, this movie is surely not an Oscar wining movie. Ahhhh but Hollywood has something else in their mind. Anyways, a good watch though, unique story about the class difference."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"It's been a while since I watched a movie that made such impact on me. First of all, I really liked the story of different social classes, despair, greed, deception, pride and prejudices. It is masterfully directed by Bong, carefully navigating through a scenario full of twists and unexpected turns. Dialogues are funny and there is good characterization making characters complexed and intriguing. Parasite can't be categorized in a specific movie genre, rather it's a mix of dark comedy, drama and thriller which is it's strong feature because there are not so many movies who can balance so well between those genres. This is movie that I will gladly watch many times. A real gem of Korean cinematography."
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"What ever brought this movie its Palm and its Oscar, I couldn't find it on the screen, and no I am not offended, neither by its story nor its violence. Try to catch Harold Pinters/Joseph Losey's The Servant (1963) starring Dirk Bogarde and you'll Se a similar theme screened in perfection, with better actors and a much better camera work. Sorry,"
기생충,Parasite,2019,1,,"I really do not know how is it rated over 8. Too many plot holes, too much drama and lack of build-up make this film very hard to watch. Is it rated that high because the majority of voters are Korean? A waste of time."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"I've loved every film of Bong Joon Ho's that I've scene dating back to the Host. One of the premier auteurs of our generation. This film did what so few films do in our current era, it genuinely surprised. The film is as authentically original and inspired as people are saying it is.  Loved it."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"A true masterpiece, 10/10! I don't think I will get to watch a better movie soon!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,Not many movies combine entertainment and social commentary in equal measure but this one sure does. There are many layers to the plot; there's the events that you're watching but there's also a deeper layer that you're almost compelled to think about as you watch. Everyone will have a slightly different takeaway of what the filmmakers are trying to say but I think everyone will get something valuable from it. I would recommend 100 percent!
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"Really good movie, well directed and played by actors, story is also Excellent, it's showing the reality of our society, and mental behavior of different people of different stage."
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"The plot starts as a comedy by taking advantage of a gullible rich lady and slowly creeps into the harsh truth of haves and have not. The climax leaves a strange impact on - ""Is it even possible to attain the status of a good earning life style for such a family in honest ways?"". One of the masterpiece from Korean films. A worthy watch that keeps you entertained!!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"This movie did resonate with its audience, it did get critical acclaim, it did win a bunch of awards, but then, guess what, I reckon I'm the edgy, white person who starts saying it's idiotic and/or overrated. I think that the primary Oscar should have gone to The Irishman, or Once upon a time... In Hollywood, or 1917 (Nineteen seventeen), or Mr. Jones, or Dark waters, or The lighthouse, or Sorry we missed you, or Richard Jewell Glass, or even Downton Abbey - the motion picture. The ACademy likes to give out Oscars to movies that push the ""correct"" political opinion. This has nothing to do with the so-called 7th art anymore."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,We should keep it in a time capsule for the future generations. This describes a whole era.
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"Good: all the actors, most of the acting and directing, hearing the beauty of the spoken Korean language, the sets (in particular, the first floor and yard of the award winning Namgoong Hyeonja designed house), the cinematography and the first half of the film. Bad: the second half of the film. Ugly: the overflowing toilet.  The first half of the movie was magical. The storyline and setup were unique, credible and crisp. Then, it all fell apart. The punchline was a low blow at best. Too many pratfalls, way too surreal, overly silly and sadly pretentious. As a member of the (target?) audience I felt cheated. It should have been so much more and could have been with very little tweaking and tightening. Bottom Line: Parasite does not deserve the Best Picture Award or the Best Director Award from the Academy, period."
기생충,Parasite,2019,3,,"The fact that there are such a ridiculous number of 10/10 reviews proves most of them are not genuine. Who cares about the ""clever"" metaphors when a movie just fizzles out into an absurd and unbelievable nonsense conclusion."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Great, Masterpiece. This movie pictures how human, rich or poor, can do anyhing at any cost to earn what they wanted. But exclusively, this movie shows that even poor people can fool or at this point, ""PARASITE"" onto you, rich or poor. At first-half of the film, I could laugh. But at second-half ('til end), I get the moral lesson of the film."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Like watching a Sergio Leone, this director is just a god in film making."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"A great movie. Not a dull moment. What a great script , acting and directing. Probably one of the most original and entertaining film I've seen in many years. A tragedy wrapt up in a comedy genre."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,Glad that I watched this movie before the Oscar nominees were announced. I feel a number of people Judge it harshly bcos it won a film over other equally excellent movies  In my opinion it's definitely one of the best movies of 2019-2020.  Excellent performances and a harsh view of people at the bottom  The movie switches very quickly from comedy to drama to violence near end.  Sad open ended finale.  Highly recommend
기생충,Parasite,2019,4,,I am still trying to figure out why would such meaningless movie get such a high ratings. There are thousands of films better than this but end up getting petty reviews.
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"An intricate depiction of the society classes forming in every modern society around the world. Rightfully asking the question: ""Who is living of whom?"" It is filled to the brim with metaphors examining the cultural clashes between two very different families from vastly different social standings, headlined by a very strong script and fleshed out characters. Furthermore, it has amazing cinematography with some creative editing choices, great sets and the shot selections are flawless."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I've been hearing great things about this and after it won 4 Oscars including Best Picture I just had to see for myself even though I wasn't 100% sure what it was about. After only 15 minutes of watching I fell in love with this movie. And it got every award it deserved. Parasite has so many genres in this movie but I would have to say this is darkly written in the most creative way possible. It's funny, dramatic, and intense. I can't even think of anything that I didn't like about this movie because I seriously enjoyed every minute of it. 10/10"
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"Great story! Beautiful film Great acting. Make sure to plan just don't go with the flow. father waits...but not sure how long.   Watch it on 4K, Oled."
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"If you want to see why this move took the Oscars, you should check it and give it a try. Maybe you would like or not. Just watch it!  Yes, the metacritic score it's really high for this movie. But yeah, it's a ""must see"" movie. The soundtrack used in this movie is fantastic!  The acting was great, from my point of view.  If want to see a drama movie with a little few scenes of comedy, a ""dark comedy"" you should try it. Trust me, you won't lose anything."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,The Korean drama and thriller written & directed by Bong Jong Ho is truly a masterpiece. It is entruguing thriller. And every bit of the screenplay keeps you in the movie till the end... Outstanding work of modern art
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"I saw this Movie just one day after it won 4 Oscars: Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Achievement in Directing, Best Original Screenplay and Best International Feature Film. For me it deserves the Oscar for Best International Movie and best Original Screenplay but the best movie of the Year?? CMON... This is the most overated movie of the Decade, it is a good movie sure, with a good Critic to society... Showing the struggle of the classes, the Decay of the Rich who lives their plastic lives, and the Poor that must fight back and rise against opression and Tirany. The problem with the movie, is that it drags in the first 30 minutes, the screentime should be cut to 1h30, 2 hours and 10 minutes is too long... The Dark Humour presented here is really good, and the Climax of the movie, starting with the Flood is also Great. But some of the dialogues in the movie are lacking. The directors work here is really good no doubt, but this movie is after all a Independant Movie with a short budget, with few sets, and some good Twists and Turns in the story... The actors, like almost every Korean movie i've seen, seem authentic and act like real people so they do a very good job. This Movie is a Good One, almost an 8 but the ending could have been better. It is far from a masterpiece, so my review score is a 7 out of 10. P.S: Loved the Critic to Kim Jong Un Regime, the Menace of the Power of a Button is as Powerfull as a Atomic Bomb LOL"
기생충,Parasite,2019,2,,"The film started off well and an interesting concept started developing However , it suddenly turned into mayhem and utter stupidity . It was nonsensical .  Yes, I got the message about the rich and poor divide etc etc but that's nothing new and just reality . I was disappointed in this movie as I'd read great reviews. It was an utter waste of time !"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"After winning the Palme d'Or in Cannes, the French Oscars let's say, Sydney Film Festival was quick to reel in that line and get Parasite to screen at multiple sold out venues around the city. At the end of the festival, the film got awarded the biggest price (Best Film) and distributor Madman Entertainment decided to ride that wave of interest in the film, releasing this Korean dark comedic masterpiece just a week later in Australian cinemas.  Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sick) is a young man with not much to look forward to. He basically lives in a basement apartment with his scruffy dad Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho), snappy mother Chung-sook (Hyae Jin Chang) and his clever sister Ki-jung (Park So-dam). Their tiny confined home feels too small to live in with four adults. They use free wi-fi from their neighbours and try to make some easy money by folding boxes for a pizza delivery company, until Ki-woo's friend offers him to take over a student to tutor.  Faking a university diploma and a shameless backstory, Ki-woo introduces himself to a rich family in a dream house with the most well maintained lawn you've ever seen. Here he becomes the tutor to Da-hye (Ziso Jung), daughter of wealthy CEO Mr. Park (Lee Sun-kyun) and his emotionally unstable wife Yeon-kyo (Jo Yeo-jeong). Everything seems to go just as planned, until the almost perfectly executed plan starts to unravel more and more out of control.  Scriptwriters Bong Joon-ho (who also directed) and Han Jin-won have so many twists up their sleeves to make this the most entertaining and well-written film you'll see this year. Every line gets delivered so smoothly, as if it seems like these characters are real people who are living through this story, with Jung Jae-il's classical score, masterfully playing in the background. The cinematography by Hong Kyung-pyo differentiates itself from a more realistic gritty style in the basement apartment, to a more dreamlike perfectly slick style when focusing on our wealthy characters. This point of view makes us look at these two very contrasting groups of people in a different way, to make it even clearer that they don't belong in the same world. Class systems have never looked more down to earth yet perfect before.  Though Bong wants you to feel for both parties, the lines will blur at certain points and make your sympathy for anyone bounce back and forth with feverish consequences. Everyone has a sense of selfishness to them when it comes to goals, but being nice doesn't take that much effort. The film focuses on poverty, desperation and what we are willing to do to take what should be ours. Tension between upperclass elegance and underground threat has never been more in your face. Bong (Okja) always loves to blur the lines of genre and he makes sure he hits every step on the staircase, to succeed in his efforts.  Parasite is a mite that doesn't discriminate and will get under every moviegoer's skin, no matter what background you come from. The power of this story, is found in the way comedy and drama rub each other in just the right way to spark a bit of thriller, that flips over into pure horror when despair and hate meet each other. This is one infestation you can't get rid off."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,After 6th watch I think I got all little details and all messages. I really love the climate change/rain message. He changes genres so smoothly and never bored me once on my 3rd watch in last week and a half. I just gotta say Bravo Bong!!!
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Greetings from Lithuania.  Gisaengchung (2019) (""Parasite"") is to simply put - the best South Korean movie i have ever seen. And i saw more then few of them and really loved them - i think that this country makes best movies in Asia - in my personal opinion.  ""Gisaengchung"" is nothing short of a small masterpiece. It is a stupendously entertaining movie that ""hooked"" me from the first 45 seconds till the last frame for its entire 2 h 9 min running time - i was blown away of how amazingly crafted, acted, written and directed this movie was in every scene. The story was fresh and unique and universal. You can throw a rock at me if Hollywood won't remake this movie with some very well known actors in near future - it is a pure diamond in a movie market.  Overall, ""Gisaengchung"" is by far one of the few best movies I've seen this year, right here along with ""Joker"" which i saw last week. It is unusually entertaining and involving story that shows of just how there are big differences in our society, between poor and rich. It's a universal theme. And this movie is a universal treasure."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Glad I managed to watch Parasite just before the Oscars. A most deserving winner, especially in Original Screenplay and Best Picture categories.  Only 10/10 I have given to a film, out of nearly 100 reviews.  I am not sure what genre Parasite is. I laughed, stood in the edge of my seat and got emotional all throughout a very compelling 2 hours and 20mins run time.  Parasite is a brilliant story about a poor family living in Seoul who tries to entrench themselves as workers in the house of the super wealthy Parks.  The contrasts between two lifestyles are beautifully portrayed and yet, unlike most movies, the rich ones are not made out to be jackasses or bad apples. They are merely a family. Certainly different, flawed, but not one you will actively root against.  The script is one of the most engaging I have ever seen. Builds at a perfect pace with the story and yet is positively full of suspense.  The acting is incredibly convincing, especially the poor family's patriarch Kim Ki-taek, who goes through a very wide range of emotions.  I have trouble pinpointing what else makes it so great, but the film flew by for me. I loved every bit of it.  Bong Joon-Ho created a masterpiece a very worthy recipient of the first Best Picture academy award for a non-English language film. It will certain open many others for others to follow him.  A must watch.  PS: the only movie that Parasite remotely reminded me off is Hirokazu Koreeda's Shoplifters (2018)"
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"Masterpiece, no cgi, no Michael Bay, extraordinary story, social critical. It'll make you think about your position as a viewer of the movie in a cinema, after you've watched it. 10/10 + Oscar"
기생충,Parasite,2019,,,"Something new, but confusing, at times boring, not funny, off tone, off performance, makes this a 3"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Full Star ratings would seem off had this movie not been such a well written roller coaster of events, this movie has moments that are as thrilling and terrifying as S. Kings Misery. This movie is realistic and immersive, simply a must watch film, with lots of hard work and time put into it, unforgettable."
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"10/10 for acting, cinematography, and plot development  1/10 for the second half  This had the potential to resolve itself epically but instead quickly descended into a messy free fall of nonsense.  There are so many intensely gripping Korean films I was sure this would be one of them. And for the first half I was engrossed. But the second half was a huge let down.  The acting and production quality are fantastic but the resolution sucks. No spoilers.  Watch the original Old Boy again, or The Chaser instead. This film has nothing but disappointment at the end.  Boring."
기생충,Parasite,2019,3,,"Parasite, directed by Bong Joon-ho, is a critically acclaimed South Korean film that has received numerous awards and accolades. However, in my opinion, the film falls short of its hype. While the premise of a lower-class family infiltrating a wealthy household is intriguing, the execution is heavy-handed and lacks subtlety.  The characters are one-dimensional and lack depth, with the lower-class family being portrayed as cunning and deceitful, and the wealthy family as naive and ignorant. The film's attempts at social commentary feel forced and preachy, with the message of class struggle being hammered home repeatedly.  Furthermore, the film's pacing is slow and uneven, with long stretches of exposition and character development that feel drawn out and unnecessary. The final act, while shocking, is also predictable and lacks emotional impact due to the lack of investment in the characters.  Overall, Parasite is a film that is overhyped and overrated. While it may appeal to those who enjoy heavy-handed social commentary, those looking for a more nuanced and subtle exploration of class struggle will be disappointed. Despite its critical acclaim, I found Parasite to be a disappointing and forgettable film."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Awesome movie, could appreciate every minute of it only because I learned how to read when I was a little child. Fair Oscar winner."
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"The responses this film draws are often a study of internalized propaganda; specifically, the smoke screen of meritocracy that attempts to cover the systemic injustices of the world. The common thread is to object to the impoverished characters as being portrayed as too capable; the ""If you're so smart, why aren't you rich?"" saying being an epitome of this mindset. It's a saying that you could hear in a schoolyard, because it betrays a childish level of understanding, or lack thereof: not considering unearned wealth transfer; not considering the disparity of opportunities; and not considering that the wealth gap is particularly large in South Korea.  It's unclear how many people who are willingly ignorant about injustice can be reached at all, but art like this film must help, at the very least by sustaining a discussion of the topic of injustice and inequality."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"My Review- Parasite My Rating 9/10  I'm so glad I got to finally see Parasite today on the day it won 2 well deserved BAFTA British Academy Awards Best Movie not in The English Language and Best Original Screenplay for its writer/ director Bong Joon Ho.  Parasite has already received numerous accolades, with six nominations at the 92nd Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best International Feature Film, making it the first South Korean film to receive Academy Award recognition. At the 77th Golden Globe Awards, the film won the award for Best Foreign Language Film. It received four nominations at the 73rd British Academy Film Awards. It also became the first non-English film to win the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture.  The film's title ""Parasite"" was selected by Bong as it served a double meaning, which he had to convince the film's marketing group to use. Bong said ""Because the story is about the poor family infiltrating and creeping into the rich house, it seems very obvious that Parasite refers to the poor family, and I think that's why the marketing team was a little hesitant. But if you look at it the other way, you can say that rich family, they're also parasites in terms of labor. They can't even wash dishes, they can't drive themselves, so they leech off the poor family's labor. So both are parasites.""  I read Director and script writer Bong Joon is a great admirer of Alfred Hitchcock and I'm sure Hitch would praise this movie even the music score is reminiscent of Hitchcock films . The film makes several nods to Alfred Hitchcock throughout. Stairs are used as a motif, voyeurism is used as characters watch scenes through windows 14 times, and (most obviously) there is a brief glimpse of an out of place Alfred Hitchcock collection in the Park's home. I thought it also reminded me of Quentin Tarantino in its dark comedy and there are some very funny moments especially in the first half of this unique and original film.  Unfortunately I've only seen Parasite on DVD but I hope to see it again on a Cinema Screen soon. It's a movie I want to watch again as it's as good as all the hype it's getting and what a journey! it takes the audience on. Described as a Black Comedy Thriller as of 2/2/20 this film had grossed a Worldwide $163.3 million and was estimated to have cost $11 million to produce.  Of course I don't know any of the actors but they're all terrific in their roles and as an ensemble cast one of the best this year . I still think it's odd to include this film in 2 Best Film Categories at next weeks Academy Awards it had no chance of winning Best Picture but I'm certain it will win Best International Feature Film and it probably deserves to. I'm still so fond of Pedro Almodóvar's Pain & Glory..  Ps an add on comment after seeing Parasite on a Cinema screen the best way to appreciate a film like this.  After seeing Parasite on a Cinema Screen at last I appreciate the movie even more. There's so much to absorb and think about in the layers of Pasasite. The story depicts Class divides, Climate Catastrophes, Nuclear War fear and Violence due to mental illness and resentment. I was wrong in my first review to think Parasite had no chance of Winning Best Film of the year and I still think it's unfair that films in a Foreign Language have 2 bites of the Best Film cherry but this movie is a great film .  This is not a new review my original will do but just an observation after seeing ""Emma"" this week which portrayed Upper Class 19th Century snobbery and class division then the excellent HBO series ""Succession ""portraying an incredibly wealthy Media magnates family living a life of incredible privilege financed by greed and cunning plotting the next coup. The common thread that Parasite, Emma and Succession have is total separation from the feelings and aspirations of anyone outside their Class it's survival at all costs and disregard anyone who smells differently speaks differently, dresses differently or anyone doesn't process a degree or wealth. The poor family's ingenious scheme to obtain a better life regardless of the outcome shows more intelligence and hope to improve their situation than the insular, neurotic self obsessed rich Park family.  2 comments from Parasite said by Ki-taek and wife Chung-sook stay in my mind .  Ki-taek: They are rich but still nice. Chung-sook, Ki-taek's wife: They are nice because they are rich.  Chung-sook, Ki-taek's wife: If I had all this I would be kinder.  Ki-taek: Rich people are naive. No resentments. No creases on them. Chung-sook, Ki-taek's wife: It all gets ironed out. Money is an iron. Those creases all get smoothed out by money.  Both families end up with creases and resentments in Parasite so I guess both families fit the definition of Parasites-  parasite  Learn to pronounce noun 1. an organism that lives in or on an organism of another species (its host) and benefits by deriving nutrients at the other's expense."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"Over the course of well-regarded and unique films such as The Host, the under-appreciated Snowpiercer and the crazy Netflix distributed Okja, Korean filmmaker Bong Joon Ho has established himself as one of the most noteworthy foreign directors of the last few decades.  Following on with his ability to mix and match genres with an ever-present dark vein of humor seeping through his narratives veins, Ho has hit it big with the surprise 2019 hit Parasite, that now sits pretty in the IMDB Top 50 films of all-time and stands head and shoulders above other foreign films from 2019 in regards to box-office takings off a small scale budget of a couple of million dollars.  Incomparable to any other film you could think of, Parasite is a very original beast, that believe it or not combines drama, comedy, thriller and even moments of horror to ensure that its many twists and turns and social commentary co-inhabit to create an entirely unpredictable experience that is best watched with as little pre-understanding as possible.  Centered around the below the poverty line Kim family and their new employment in the household of the wealthy Park family, Parasite allows Ho to weave together a loaded plot-line that may seemingly be headed one way, only to surprise us all as it veers further and further away from the expected.  Wonderfully played out by its core cast, with highlights from Kang-ho Song as father Ki-taek and Hye-jin Jang as mother Chung-sook, Parasite is the type of unnerving film that keeps you mentally on edge throughout as you're glued to the screen, unable to turn away from a disaster in the making that must surely be headed towards a finale as wild as we would expect from a director like Ho.  As you watch the expertly directed, edited and scored film, one that has you laughing one minute and gasping for air the next, you begin to appreciate that you're watching a director operating at the top of their game, in what's still likely a career only around its halfway mark, it's exciting to think of where Ho and his inventive mind can go in the future as he continues to give us films that seem to be cut entirely from their own cloths.  In an age where many films are nothing but pale imitations, remakes or sequels, its exciting to see efforts such as Parasite that give us something new, fresh and exhilarating, no doubt a reason why the word of mouth from cinema-goers helped make Parasite a world-wide smash hit and a genuine Best Picture contender at the upcoming Oscars.  Final Say -  While not flawless, Parasite isn't far off it, a darkly observed social commentary piece that is both heartbreaking and brilliantly humorous, Bong Joon Ho has further established himself as one of the in-form directors working today with what could well be his most important film yet.  4 1/2 peaches out of 5"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Not perfect, but it's brilliant in many ways. The director should be awarded."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"There are 100s of movies worth better, never reached the oscars. You can watch it maybe once or twice but definitely won't keep it in your collections. Well executed and it is been overrated for it ."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"'Parasite', this year's winner of the Cannes Film Festival's highest award, the Palme d'Or, is so many things - tiptoeing different genres, exploring themes of family, work, inequality, and the class divide - rolled into one thoroughly wild, exciting, hilarious, dark, tragic, and unpredictable film.  Honestly, I can only sum it up in the wise words spoken by one of the characters: THIS. IS. SO. METAPHORICAL."
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"Parasite reminds me of those novels you sometimes read in English class or a literature club (ala Ulysses) and you had to appreciate all the intricacies, themes, and symbolism or risk looking uncultured. But those novels missed something really important, that gets lost in all the circlejerking about the symbolism and little details - whether or not its actually interesting to read. Whether it provides a good story, good dialogue, good characters.  Similarly, Parasite is a movie rich in themes and symbolism. What I particularly liked is the mature exploration of class dynamics. Its the obvious central theme of the film and its done very well. I dont think anything in Hollywood could ever manage to explore this theme with such nuance and maturity.  This movie is also a really good work of art. The direction is top quality, and it effortlessly goes from comedy, to family drama, to horror, to thriller, and then finally ends in a Tarantino-esque finale.  But the actual plot of the film? The dialogues, the drama, its all mediocre at best. What really happens in this film. What makes a viewer curious, interested, surprised? How do the characters develop, how does the plot develop, where and when is there interesting dialogue that pulls you in?  In my opinion, the overarching script of this movie is not particularly strong when you evaluate it in terms of core storytelling. And worse, it doesn't use its runtime well in order to tell whatever it wants to tell. And while a film critic might be impressed by its symbolism and the way it shifts in tone and genres, I think it actually detracts from the viewer experience if the primary aim of the viewer is to see an enjoyable movie.  I'm far from someone who merely enjoys popcorn fiction. There's a reason I hate Marvel movies. But I also think that a movie has to strike a balance, I don't think Parasite did that. I think it has benefited from collective overhyping that is partially a result of the heaps of praise by critics and partially because it is a decent movie released in a time of popcorn movie trash."
기생충,Parasite,2019,5,,"After watching this ""masterpiece"", I felt as if there was missing something, or a major twist was left out. I was told by plenty of people, that you would be amazed about the twists, and there would be a lot of surprises. Which sadly didn't happen, and I really felt that it was missing that huge ""WHAT!?"" feel, which never came. Everything was so predictable, and there wasn't as much comedy as expected. I wouldn't see it again, but I'm good now that I have seen it tho."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"This film is a masterpiece, a cinematic slap. Parasite is cinematic perfection. It's not just my favourite film of the year, it's in my top 5 of my best movies of the last decade. Just when you think you know what type of movie it is, it suddenly becomes a completely different movie when you least expect it. Crazy, funny, incredibly smart. I loved it. I've tried to keep my review to a minimum because the less said about this movie the better, everyone needs to see this movie !"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Had a free screening at our campus. What I like is that it could have been mean spirited at any point, but it seems to have compassion for every party involved, no matter their transgression you understand and sympathize with them. This is way different than current day films, such as Knives Out or the other nominees where the social critique involves mockery and derision of the 'villains'. I wonder if it's the difference between hollywood white privilege vs korean cinema coming from an entirely different position of the socio economic hierarchy."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,Believe the hype. This is one of the best if not the best film in years. Watch it and you'll see why
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I never write reviews but this film was a masterpiece! Definitely one of my favorite movies now. Go watch it, you won't regret it!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"This film is such a perfect masterpiece in every facet that one cannot be but astounded and has become interested in everything Korean. I am in love with Korean language, with its sweet words-enunciation, the cadence, the soft and musical ending of every sentence. However,the less one read about the movie beforevwatchng it, the better. Go and see it, you won't regret"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,For sure the best movie I've seen of 2019. Nothing holds a candle to it.
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,Its a little overrated. 7.5/10. Not bad not so good.
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"This movie is not a horror movie not a suspense movie but I was just on the edge of my seat the whole way through. The tense string of relationships that hold all of the characters together... More thrilling than a thriller, more suspenseful than a suspense movie, More guessing than a murder mystery. It takes the typical human reaction to the next level. Just watch it without any prejudice. It will send your emotions on a journey that does not allow you to cheer for one character or the other. Entertaining as well as stab you in the stomach deeply with a moral sword to see how you feel. A masterpiece with your morals as well as your feelings for justice."
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"It's a ""lyrical comedy"" film (which means it's not funny, but you are not supposed to cry over the misfortunes either) with a dramatic story. To put it simply it's a ""slice of scam"" movie.  It's a bit weird in looking ""more"" than its subject matter, but it's not pretentious. All the film-students-never-film-workers and the so-called ""movie"" ""critics"" tried their hardest to make you think this is some indie art-house mumblecore drama about gay-cowboys eating pudding, and oscars are always a ""black spot"" for the movies, but in the end this is an alright watch. And it will leave you with nothing, just like all the average films."
기생충,Parasite,2019,5,,"Movie was recommended by friend, who lauded it how many rewards it had gotten, so we watched this with high expectations. Despite the movie calling itself comedy there were only a few places in between that were relatively funny. And therein lies the problem, the movie was undecided which genre it wants to be, drama, comedy, horror, action? The story depends on plot twists to keep it going, some are predictable some are unexpected, and some are outright stupid. I'm talking about the finale, it just looks out of nowhere and forced so the viewers don't end up with a lackluster ending. It's a bizarre flick, but in no way great. I'd give it a slightly higher rating but there's a need for counter-balance to all the reviews overrating this movie."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"You know a movie is good when there's been two months since you saw it and you're still thinking about it. I've enjoyed Bong Joon Ho's previews work but I wanted to enter the cinema with with a clear mind and no expectations. And I was shocked. The movie, every aspect of it, is perfect, from music to script everything was just beautiful. Easy best movie of the year and one of the best of this decade."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"The Academy has made a great decision on to laureate Parasite as Oscars' 2020 Best Original Screenplay, Best Film, Best Directing and Best Picture Awards. Besides having written a new chapter on Cinema's History as the first non-English-language movie to have gained this epic achievement, the Korean film is a timeless masterpiece, whose stylistics, cinematography, editing work, original screenplay and final outcome will be studied for decades and ever!  Best Picture to Parasite! More than well-deserved!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"Less subtle but much more embodied depiction of social class at where each class lives. A Twist in the second half of film. Dark, funny, thrilling, and thought provoking. This film has all combinations."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"A true masterpiece. I feel like I went through an experiment where the time went still and I experienced a piece of art such as this, I absloutely, wholeheartedly loved every single second of this film."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"Been some years now that I've been watching Korean Movies. Been trying my best to let friends know about how amazing some of them can be but with no luck, the language barrier and the different culture is enough to put off most from even trying. I'm glad I've sticked to it though. Old Boy was my introduction to korean movies, but Memories of Murder is what kept going back for more. Through MM I got to discover Kang Ho Song, who I personally think is an amazing actor, wont be exaggerating if I had him in my top 5, of which Al Pacino is #1. As for Parasite, dont need me to tell you that this is a gem of a movie that can't be missed, even if this is your first time venturing into korean cinema."
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,Its not often I go to see subtitled films but given the reviews I thought and I had to see this one and I am so glad I did.  It's fantastically different and a great story that really draws you in but never stops surprising you with a laugh or shock around every corner.  A great film and well worth anyone's time to go and see it.
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"""Parasite"" is a powerful and perfect film that will leave you in awe with its twisted, funny and tension-filled scenes. Writer/director Bong Joon-ho's approach to social classes creeps up on you like suspense in a Hitchcock film. . In this dramatic thriller with elements of dark comedy, an unemployed family schemes their way into working for a much wealthier family by posing as highly-qualified individuals. . Where to begin on how great of a film ""Parasite"" is? Never has there been a film of this genre to exceed so much and so perfectly. All the performances are incredible, the direction is Joon-ho's finest and most masterful and the story is beyond relevant to all of us. You never know where ""Parasite"" will lead you but when it gets there, it shocks you or it makes you laugh or even both. This film ranks among the best of the decade and definitely one of the best of the year. An absolute must-see."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"It's like the world, for the first time, found a box of Korean movies. Having never seen a Korean film they eagerly grabbed one off the top and watched it, and said, 'oh my God, this is the best thing ever'. My advice is to keep digging in that box. There's a lot more that are a lot better in there."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,I had no idea what to expect going into Parasite. Pleasantly surprised. It's about a low income family who deceives a wealthy family into hiring them - and soon the low income family weeds into the wealthy family's lives and begins to take complete control over them. But all is not what it seems - as the wealthy family's house harbors a dark secret. The script is excellent. You really care about all of the characters and you see this complex situation from every angle. One of the best movies this decade.
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,People can be parasites is what is it about this film and have lots of messages!
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,Simply Amazing. The movie has a little bit of everything. One of the best films I've seen.
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,I'll keep this brief. This film is best enjoyed sans spoilers. Stellar cast-not one weak performance in this film. Superbly done.
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"It's just Fantastically Fabulous Masterpiece shown in the most creative way as possible..The content is so unique, never seen before..so creative, suspenseful ...Hats off to the makers, they're at the best of movie work!! People need to watch this!!!!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"If a film makes you think continuously even after the show ends, it must be a great one! And this one did just that. Packed with terrific direction, commendable performances from the whole cast, the sheer excellence in story writing and screenplay alongside some beautifully crafted cinematography this film is surely a treat in every category. It made me think, it made me curious about the nuances and the small details and hints it got all over it. I just couldn't express the feelings I got watching this. In one word it's truly a masterpiece!  It Won 4 academy awards this year, and that's not a mean feat! Making history at the oscars by winning the best film award as a foreign film for the first time ever. It alone portrays how much this film has been applauded by the critics, the industry people and us ; the audience. This is one of those rare movies where majority of us have the same opinion about. It's entertaining, thrilling, with some dark twists and some disturbing scenes as well that will surely make an impact in your mind. I assure you ; this movie will be in your head for a very long period of time!  It brilliantly exposes the capitalism system in society that has been presented as the 'Parasite' in here. The class difference, the economical boundaries set by the same people. It does symbolise with every aspect of the core issues that every major society in the world currently faces. One thing That I absolutely loved about it was the simplistic way it took to handle those sensitive subjects. And it can be applicable to any country though it's been made having Korean culture and society in mind ; this story, would be relatable to everyone. No matter the country Someone lives in.  But you need to give your sincere focus and intellectuality while watching as it demands that. Every scene there has been crafted metaphorically. And those clever set ups can only be observed thoroughly if you are paying enough attention. Every character and their actions represent something. And you need to find that connection. And don't worry you will ; as the direction has been top notch throughout the entirety of the film. The character developments and The hidden metaphors are a treat to watch and experience.  My own personal tip would be to avoid every promo, trailer and articles before watching it. Going with a blank slate will help you to digest every bit of it naturally. Enough of the review now, I just wanna say, go and watch this film immediately. It's amazing and a surreal experience that could not be forgotten easily. Top of the table recommendation."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"I rate the film for its intention, for its rawness, and for the impression it leaves after I walk out of the cinema. Nevertheless, I don't feel convinced by the acting, nor the somewhat implausible story line. I can watch this film as a well-packaged piece of entertainment. But I don't think I'd be missing much, if I hadn't watched it."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"A relatively simple, low-key racket spirals way out of control as an impoverished lower class Korean family smoothly weasels their way into the lives of a wealthy, naive, white collar household.  Unpredictably composed, Parasite effortlessly shifts between several genres, evenly mixing comedy with tragedy and several stops in between. Of the versatile tools in that particular box, the film's at its best on the frequent occasions that it ratchets up the tension. I constantly caught myself holding in a deep breath, completely immersed in the moment and conflicted about the best possible outcome. Not all of those nail-biters lead to fireworks, and the film is careful not to overplay its hand, so that, when the time is right, those inevitable explosions land like a flurry of unexpected body blows.  The first hour is captivating, as the leeches' shady plot comes together and their long con gains momentum, but the home stretch, with its string of sharp curves and grim consequences, is unrestrained chaos in the best of ways. One helluva ride."
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"I was dying to watch this movie with a point like this but' it just doesn't deserve this score. If Inception is 8,6 this movie had a 7,5 with a good perspective. The movie got really meaningless every minute. It ended so ridiculous, ""Oh, I have a plan. Let's make us rich."" Wow, why didn't you do that before? It can be enjoyed very hard but never gets this score."
기생충,Parasite,2019,3,,"The Emperors new clothes, that sums up the reaction to this movie. This movie is the modern day ""Slumdog Millionaire"". One of the strangest Oscar decisions ever. It's not a bad movie by any stretch, but a masterpiece? LOLOLOLOL, no - not at all. The acting is average, there is little character development that is compelling, the script is boring, zero humor. At no point does this movie grip you and beg you to keep watching to learn where it goes. Years from now like ""Slumdog"" we will look back, especially at the cinematography and laugh at how great we thought this was."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"The problem is that the Koreans and Japanese and other people from that side of the world make so many disturbing movies that I just don't watch them. Now the name of this movie is ""Parasite"" and that doesn't fill me with confidence. But I've been assured that this is not a disturbing movie so I'll go give it a chance. But the one thing I have to say, only in America can a foreign language film win best picture in the greatest award ceremony of the year."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,That's it. That's all I'm writing about this film. Now go watch it if you haven't already.
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"Bong Joon Ho directed one of my favorite movies of 2017, Okja, and has done it again in 2019 with Parasite. A working class family worms their way into the lives of a wealthy family with unexpected results. Ho has written a sardonic satire which loses nothing in translation from Korean to English. Koreans, like we American counterparts, have a 99% and a 1% who look down on the rest of us with disdain. The script is right on point and the entire cast is excellent. Easily one of the ten best films of 2020."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Korean films are love. Yes, they are! 'Oldboy', ""The Man From Nowhere"", ""I Saw The Devil"", ""The Chase"" etc. etc. You name it. Korean directors are masters when it comes to deliver messages about social taboo or to execute a thriller on screen in possibly the most perfect way. 'Parasite' adds and in fact stretches the legacy of Korean films in even broader perspective. Genres can be deceptive at times for some cinematic creations. And for films like 'Parasite', it spans over a wide sphere for sure. Kudos to the director Bong Joon-ho for giving this masterpiece which is multi-layered and shows the economic inequality in the pro-capitalist society of South Korea in a way which consists so much mixed emotions, sense of humour, lots of adrenaline rush, few nail-biting moments as well; all revolve around primarily two economically contrasting families. It pin-points out the drawbacks of extreme capitalism and plutocracy in its usual neo-noir black comic style, which will eventually grows on the minds of the audience. No wonder why this cinematic gem has got almost 10 mins of standing ovation at the Cannes and has won 4 Oscars at the 92nd Academy Awards including ""The Best Picture"" award as a Non-English film for the first time ever in the history of the Academy Awards. It's rightfully the MOVIE OF THE YEAR OF 2019!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"It's hard to nail down what type of movie Parasite is, but this drama/thriller/comedy is definitely worth seeing. Bong Joon-ho tells this story in a way that keeps you engaged and keeps you guessing, with protagonists you can't fully like and antagonists you don't really hate. Even though I may not agree with every decision this film makes, I enjoyed the journey and I'll be thinking about it for a very long time."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,A very strange movie. Not sure if I loved or hated it more. The acting was good but I did not get the purpose or morale of the story line. Well maybe there was none and I am just thinking too much.
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"In some ways its kinda scary and its because you never know who you think you know. Also, this movie in some ways reminds me of Sweenie Todd and The Family in one. Anyway, better than both and is a must watch!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"A down-on-their-luck, low-class family con their way into the employ of a rich household, but events turn sinister after they find a secret in the basement.  Maybe I've just seen too many really messed up movies from the far East, but at the half-way point of Parasite, which sees the discovery of a hidden bunker and an unexpected inhabitant lurking within, I hoped that matters would get seriously twisted in the way that only Asian cinema can; but while things certainly get dark, the film is not nearly as edgy, or as bizarre, or as wild as the premise suggests.  The initial plot twists and turns are deftly handled by director Bong Joon-ho, there are some superbly executed scenes of tension, the performances are great, the cinematography is lovely, and the film's social commentary on how different classes view and treat each other allows for plenty of delicious satire, but the second half of the film still feels frustratingly restrained in terms of sheer audacity. Restrained, and incredibly drawn out, Bong Joon-ho letting too many scenes drag their heels, with the ending taking an eternity to arrive.  In short, definitely worth a watch, but a serious contender for best picture? Surely not."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Bong Joon-ho's (Snowpiercer/The Host) latest is coming to local screens w/the Palm D'Or stamp of excellence & it is well deserved. This twisty long con of a film finds a down on their luck family (downtrodden due to their own circumstances or the current economic paradigm in South Korea?) who thanks to a friend of the college aged son gets an opportunity to get a job as tutor for a rich family (the daughter's grades aren't up to snuff, at least according to the overprotective mother) but once he gets his foot in the door he finds he can bring the rest of his disparate clan (his mom, dad & sister) into the mix. His sister comes in as an artistic coach to the well-off youngest son & elaborate schemes are perpetrated to oust the driver & the maid (who worked at the property w/the architect of the manse) so that his parents can fill in those slots. So far so good (depending on whose side you happen to be on since the elite clan is depicted is out of touch & inheritors of the new Korea) but then a genius twist happens which throws the entire plot upside down, forcing our anti-heroes to make a decision which will effect their world. Wonderfully delineated as a lighthearted (at least for the most part) 'me against them' (there's a wonderful sequence where the working family rushes home in the rain & their journey home is literally a descent into hell) which rides the fine line between cruel & mirthful. One of the year's best, catch it!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,10/10 - undoubtedly original and captivating...this is why we go to the cinema
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Director Bong Joon Ho has been on my radar for years now, as I believe him to be one of the best storytellers out there right now. Admittedly, I haven't seen the majority of his films but his two most recent works in Snowpiecer and Okja were among the best films of their consecutive years. I thought both of those films were great, so I was very eagerly awaiting his newest film, Parasite. After viewing, not only does this film deserve to be talked about as one of the best films to be released in 2019, but I personally think this may just be the very best movie you'll see all year. Now, some people may not like the turn it takes, but here's why I think Parasite demands to be seen.  To go into detail about this premise would be to ruin it for those who haven't seen it, so I'll stick to the basics here. The Kim family lives in a basement living space. All unemployed, they find any way they can to make things work. Ki-woo, the eldest sibling in the family, is given the opportunity to tutor the daughter of the rich Park family. Getting smarter and smarter as the first act really kicks into gear, the Kim family becomes a group of very clever con-artists. Meaning well and doing everything they can to keep things legitimate, this makes for some terrific tension.  The biggest praise I can give this film is that it's constantly in motion, never wasting a moment to surprise you. The set-up for this movie has many clever aspects to it, the second act throws you a real curveball and the finale doesn't disappoint either. Some viewers may think this movie goes off the rails toward the end, but I found it to be an overall brilliant piece of storytelling. Each time you think the movie has said everything it wants to, it becomes that much more interesting. In other hands, this story could've have come off as a very generic film, but there's truly something special about how well-made Parasite is.  Wonderfully shot by cinematographer Kyung-pyo Hong, each frame of this movie has more than one thing to say. It's very rare these days that shot compositions are done in such a way that they seem to tell a story as well, but even in the moments when the focus is on the characters alone, there are things happening in the background or even signs in the framing that things are coming soon. This movie is brilliantly made in every way.  It's very rare when I review a film and struggle to at least come up with one negative here, so I won't bother trying, because I loved this movie too much to let anything take away from it. I will just say that certain aspects may not work for everyone. Parasite is a perfect example of why I love movies so much. A great, engaging story that surprises you from start to finish, along with one of the best crews to work on a film yet this year. I can't praise this film enough. This Korean language film has broken through and I wouldn't be surprised in the slightest if it takes home the award for best foreign film and even a nomination for best picture. This is as close to a masterpiece you can get today."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"This is the best movie of 2019, over. RESPECT, over."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"My second time seeing a subtitled film in the theater after Raw 2016 and Parasite was so worth it! It's about a family that lives in a little house that want better things. Such a gloriously well filmed story in every aspect including the cinematography, writing, production design, and captivating characters! Well deserving of the awards/nominations; unfortunate people didn't like the movie."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"Directed by Bong Joon-ho. Starring Song Kang-ho, Choi Woo-shik, Chang Hyae-jin, Park So-dam, Cho Yeo-jeong, Lee Sun-kyun, Lee Jung-eun, Jeong Ji-so, Park Myung-hoon, Jung Hyeon-jun, Park Seo-joon, Park Geun-rok. (R)  Teen-aged Choi, from a lower-class, unemployed family, deceives his way into a position as tutor for the daughter within the prosperous Park family; soon, the rest of his family begins ingratiating (and insinuating) themselves into the Park's lives. To tell more would spoil the pleasures of this deliciously demented parable on class, greed, prejudice and more. As expected from a Bong Joon-ho film, the tone boldly changes at will (mostly between hysterical satire and nerve-wracking thriller), but the transitions are more fluid than ever before for the talented filmmaker--or perhaps it's just because the story and technique is so gripping. Meticulously designed and flawlessly performed by its cast (the first foreign-language group to ever score the ensemble cast award from the Screen Actors Guild), its audacious tangle of ideas and statements packaged with artful, precise elegance. Some of the metaphors come off as shopworn in their exactness, but the film is so otherwise ingeniously constructed that it takes effort to recall in the aftermath exactly how the incidents all piled up. Amusing scriptwriting workshop exercise idea: present the first twenty minutes and last twenty minutes of the movie and see how someone tries to navigate a connection between the endpoints.  91/100"
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"Parasite is without a doubt a well-thought good movie. It's clearly that it took lots of brains and talent to produce such a tape. It even has a message and on realities of society and a study on social classes in Korea. It addresses the issue of attitudes and the way we look at life, be it positive or negative, it has a huge impact. In addition, in general i love Asian Cinema, especially Chinese and Korean films. BUT saddly, this not for me.  I did not like it. Did not enjoy it. Once I hit the 90 minute mark i was just about to give up. Still i stayed till the end because of the amazingly great reviews.  Korean movies are just fantastic, and this might not be the exception. I have seen many online and in cinemas. they are AWESOME.  Parasite to me was annoying, depressing, negative.... a total tale of betrayal... Parasite tries to teach that you must never open the doors of your house nor your trust to others... or at least be super careful..?? could be.  You can watch the movie and make up your mind. You might be among the 99.99% of people who loves it. I am in the 0.01 % who do not :)  (my humble opinion)"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,This is cinema in its purest form. Parasite is pure art and that movie which we should recommend to people who don't watch movies and show them how good cinema is. Parasite is an exhilarating experience and a movie which scored full marks in every department. Bong Joon Ho is one of the best directors in the world right now with this masterpiece. The message the movie gives about different classes of people really strikes us and it was done by some very powerful performances. The whole cast deserves our applause. Parasite is that movie that we won't forget about for a long time even if we watch it only one time. Hats off.
기생충,Parasite,2019,1,,"I went into this movie with very high hopes. So many accolades and Oscars have been thrown at this movie, and while that's not the main requirement for a great movie, it gives off the impression that there has to be SOME redeeming qualities about it. I was excited to see a foreign-language film win Best Picture and was fully prepared to at least enjoy the movie as a social commentary, as many people lauded it as a powerful work of art and ""masterpiece"" (a word that is used WAY too often these days).  So basically, I hated it. I got about an hour and a half into the film before my mom and I decided we had enough and couldn't succumb ourselves to watching the rest of this cartoonish sequence of events, despite the fact that I rented it. I could state a plethora of reasons for despising the film but to summarize my thoughts, I felt that the characters were underdeveloped and acted more like caricatures than real people we encounter, the film's aesthetic was not pleasing for the viewer to watch (and I understand that the movie's uneasiness was the point but I was not a fan of the directing style and the strange shots) and I kept thinking some bizarre creature was gonna come out and fully push this film into fantasy/horror genre. I just really did not like anything about it. I usually always finish movies once I'm dedicated to watching something but this was just impossible. I get some of the messages the director was trying to make but it comes off as a complete joke to me that this film won so many awards, including BEST PICTURE. None of the characters were likable. Absolutely none. I'm not sure if I was supposed to hate the rich family for just being rich and slightly conceited and root for the poor family because of their circumstances, but they didn't seem to have any empathy or compassion for even other working-class people like them in the pursuit to get what they wanted which came off as very cold and sad. I love films that make you question who the protagonists and antagonists are and I know not all movies are meant to be uplifting, but these characters were lazily written and we don't get any insight into their inner monologue and feelings. The acting was very mediocre for the most part too and sometimes downright cringe-worthy.  I truly don't know what I missed but this was just not my cup of tea (or my mom's) and it felt unnecessarily gruesome and strange rather than masterful and sharp. Instead of awaiting the next moment with excitement and suspense, I found myself cringing at the actors' performances as they weren't believable and was confused at how poorly-written the dialogue was. Not everything that's out there and different hits the mark. This did NOT hit the mark for me."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,I can't get enough of it. I watched it second time and it is even better than first time and first time was like amazing amazing.
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,Probably the best movie of this year. I was on the edge of my seat through the whole movie. Acting is so natural and trailer didn't reveal anything to me and I'm grateful for that. This is another Korean masterpiece and it reminds me a little of Oldboy. It is shame that I had to watch it online because they aren't showing it in my cinema.
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"If Memories of Murder did not solidify Mr. Bong's place as one of this century's greatest artists, then this film certainly did. I cannot remember the last time I saw a film this great in theaters. By a full 1.5 stars, this film has replaced Once Upon a Time in Hollywood as my favorite film of 2019. Of course, that is subject to change, but I can't see this being beat any time soon.  Parasite is a film about which I think I should say as little as possible. Knowing nothing about the plot going in was a great benefit. The film has so much to say about class, about wealth, about family, about society. It is all so focused and direct. The movie never meanders or wanders off to other topics. It is excellently paced and has fantastic editing. The script is so well-written, both in terms of dialogue, progression of the plot, set-up and payoff, reincorporation, and commentary. The film looks fantastic, as most of this director's other pictures do. The music is pretty great, very well timed and sometimes used for comedic effect. The acting is great, too. Song Kang-Ho is great as usual, but the younger actors and the women do great as well. I especially loved Jo Yeo-Jeong's performance. I think watching this in theaters is definitely worth it if you can manage.  I loved this movie. I think it is a pretty accessible foreign film. My showing was pretty full, and the next two showings were sold out entirely. I'm really happy that people are watching this, and I hope to God that the movie gets the Academy recognition it deserves.  9.5/10, could be a 10 on the second watch."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,Didn't have to time to watch before the Oscars. Just have and all awards duly deserved (even if there had been better competition). A movie to leave you speechless. It really is that good.
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"It is demonstrably an excellent film within the first 15 minutes and it gets better. It has a very good script, one which is honed with good characterization and motive, together with fine structural exposition. No other script in the 2020 Oscars has the qualities that this one has in terms of writing skill.  In terms of execution, the directing and other technical components, all coalesce brilliantly. It is probably the editing too where so many remarkable films excel that lifts the film again. The sequences in the house between the families are memorable here as the tension is raised with so much at stake.  The story has many layers which are relevant to this time: chiefly inequality, but also other themes too which are touched on in deft ways and through the characters so as to move the story along toward its rather terrible conclusion. The ending is somewhat classical; a purge clarifies the entire drama, and it is effective in its own terms, but it also the only part of script that is not entirely ideal. Other choices might have been made which do not make the one we see an error.  Signalling 'wokeness' is pointless with this film. It is a very good film and will be referenced by film makers and students for years to come. That durability is honor indeed."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"But its an amazing movie to follow from start to end. it has humour, sorrow, genial twists and lures, marvellous acting from the entire cast. the filmography is a marvel itself, and should be seen even though you might not like south korean film.the transitions between scenes are what i call supersmooth, and very well spiced musical score, that makes you relax as well as take your breath away of shock jolts that appears from nowhere.  its a comedy satire, with a whole lot of wishing well realism, a quick look at south korean sosciety, the extreme contrasts , and the serendipidness of life that makes a grumpy old man impressed. its a top notch flick and its highly recommended."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"For me it's not worth the hype and not Oscar worthy at all.  The story is good but the execution is far from great.  The characters are not developed enough for you to sympathize with any of them. For example you have no context and never get to know the personality of the son in the poor family which is just one of the main characters.  The acting is exaggerated and shallow and leaves you wondering if it's supposed to be a comedy but then it doesn't get to be funny. On the other hand many reviews say it's a thriller, but it never made me care what happens if they are caught.  Some parts are also very implausible, for example in the final scenes, where people randomly live / die independently of the severity of the injuries.  Then there's the social inequality theme. Low income people are portrayed as the scammers, so I wasn't able to sympathize with them.  Couldn't rate it higher than 7."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,Utterly bonkers at times but always brilliant something completely fresh for the first time in a long while. Loved every second couldn't take my eyes off the screen words can not justify just how great this film was other than films this good and this original really don't come around very often. Truly riveting and a true joy to watch.
기생충,Parasite,2019,,,"Long before Parasite ended (I had to grit my teeth to hang on till the finish) I had diagnosed Bong Joon-ho with ADHD. The film is like a random collage of different ways to approach the story: slapstick, hard-hitting social commentary, mystery, comedy of manners, tear-jerker or thriller.  There's a lot of good acting, but the psychological climate keeps changing before you can start to feel any connection with a character's situation. It reminded me of Thai movies 50 years ago, where every production had to cover all the bases: romance, crime, thrilling chases, and lots of hilarious (well, meant meant to be hilarious) comic relief. This wasn't as much fun. At the end, I had no interest in what lay wait for the characters after the finale, but I was very happy. I only rented the film."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"This movie grabbed my interest immediately and never let go. well-made all around. a memorable experience. (1 viewing, 2/15/2020)"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Stunning. This is a movie of superlatives. Every aspect of this movie is well done from the original story to the acting and directing. It is a drama, comedy, unbiased social commentary, thriller - a lot in one.  The completely accessible and involving story is well written and constructed - every scene has a purpose. Given the extremes that this story goes to - it's still plausible - the thriller elements don't get out of hand or descend into stupidity. There is a social commentary on class and wealth that is so effectively laid out from start to finish. It has changed the way I think about relationships across the wealth divide.  Don't read anything about the story before you watch it. Just go and see it.  This Korean cast and director have made an unforgettable film that will be talked about for years to come. And it deserves every accolade out there."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Of course Parasite could be anything ... which is why you should avoid Spoilers at all costs. Many have made a point about this and they are right. If you like movies with social commentary, this one is for you. It is so good, you want to talk about everything. Performances, story and all of it.  If you don't mind the subtitles go for it. I am expecting there to be an American remake anytime soon. So watch it before it becomes a thing. Especially now with the Golden Globes win and Oscar recognition (both deservedly!). South Korean cinema especially concerning drama and thrillers is really something I can advise anyone to watch. The quality is high and there are many things to discover. Not to mention they deliver surprises for anyone watching ... which is a good point for this movie too!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Parasite is one of the most original creative films I have seen in many years. Its tense, funny, heart warming, shocking, all in one film. The acting, and writing is absolute top notch. I can not recommend this movie enough."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Its really difficult for a new film to come out & satisfy me & outperform well known masterpiece thrillers from the sixth sense to modern mystery inception But this movie did exactly that i loved this movie more than fight club, inception, se7en,gonegirl,shutter island Give it try for first 5 min, then. U will witness the greatest achievement in filmmaking of this decade This movie has set new standard which i think difficult to crack for normal director"
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"Ok ok, I've got to give it to the filmmakers that this unusual film is beautiful shot & acted. But for me, it was also a disheartening mess, taking dreadful closterphobic turns as it descended into the depths."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"Director Bong Joon-Ho really did it with his latest picture ""Parasite"" as it is one entertaining dark suspense drama that is revealing as the plot twist with a surprise which brings change for all of the characters. Despite reading subtitles the film is thrilling and entertaining as it involves the poor Ki-taek family who have a young boy and girl who become tutors to the kids of the wealthy Park family only a scheme really lies underneath it all only an incident happens and a discovery changes the game for all, still the Ki-taek family is stubborn and proud as they will do anything to survive. Overall good take and spin on class that's supported by shrewdness, suspense, intrigue, drama, and pumping black heart like comedy. ""Parasite"" by far by the way it entertains and grabs you was one of 2019's best films."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,No doubt this was a great film with a strong plot but not that awesome to win an Oscar award - otherwise this film is definitely worth that watch showing some humor and suspense.
기생충,Parasite,2019,1,,Skip this movie. Cannot understand how anyone can think this is good.
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,You will experience twist after twist while watching this movie. It contains very mild but catchy dark humour. Some scenes will create cold waves inside your lumbar spine. You will be thinking the ways to get rid of the troubles along with the characters of the movie.
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,I watched this movie (before Oscars) and I know this movie will get awards for sure! And I just came to know that this movie got BEST PICTURE on Academy Awards! WELL DESERVED!  Parasite created a history in Academy Awards! A MUST WATCH!
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"(Flash Review)  WOW! I did not see all that coming. The film sets the stage with this severely lower class family who live in a crappy garden apartment who hatch a plan to fake their way into a wealthy family's life to feed off them like parasites. They are doing real services but under a false guise while earning the family's trust. With ample tension and drama there, the film then shifts up a gear with a surprise revelation about the previous housekeeper. Topping that, the film shifts into high gear with a wild grand finale. The story was original, well-written and semi-believable with twists that don't cheat the viewer. Complimented by great cinematography and editing made the film gripping and captivating. This film can be analyzed from several angles and is aptly named so watch, enjoy, ponder."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I can't believe people have rated it 6/10. Just how? Not trying to point out fingers but it feels like most people are frustrated that a foreign movie won the Oscar and they wanted their favorite to win. Anyways everyone deserves to have their opinion. I watched movie yesterday and gosh it was more than Perfect. Most of the time I regret watching a movie coz it's too predictable for me. This one blew my mind. I was literally worried about something might happen or other thing not to happen and the story completely flips to unimaginable plot. Also the details in the movie that the director has gone through. Marvelous. For me, I'll put this movie alongside Shawshank Redemption."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"The acting,the story, the surprises and tension of the film is amazing. Shows the poor side of South Korea as well and the difference between rich and poor is ironically presented in many scenes. Watched 2 hours in one breath. Applause for this movies to creators."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"Quite how this managed to win best picture at the Oscars is beyond me. How it won best director is truly daft, especially up against the magnificent Sam Mendes. It's a really good first half of character set up, though they themselves are never really developed, witty and fast paced, followed by a let down of a second half that doesn't deliver on its midway point revelations."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"The art of the uncomfortable.. When words and images are not enough to articulate the feel.. 'Parasite' is one such powerful, subtle, sublime, sinister (brother.basement.scholar rock) social satire on the class conflict, social inequality, underbelly of capitalism, superficial niceties and the hidden apathy & empathy that this world holds or may be it was always like this.. One hell of a climax and the thought, the question that follows 'why the ending was like this'? One has to reflect to understand the comedy of ever sinful poverty, appropriation of cultures, shotput, medal, the disgusting flooding, the housekeeper, respect, forgery artist and the simpleton brother laughing.. A little more realization and there you find the ghost, the lights switching on and off, obliviously acting master, the smell of poverty and anchor of the story 'The Morse code' with its knowledge to interchangeable parasite(s) and the host(s).. Between so much more was said in the unsaid and that is the beauty of this cleverly written, acted, directed Korean tragic, haunting, conflicting, comedy classic.. A must watch👍👍👍"
기생충,Parasite,2019,,,"A meticulously crafted & confidently narrated black comedy thriller that offers a biting take on the socio-economic state of modern South Korea, while also taking a jab at late capitalism, the 2019 Palme d'Or winner is Bong Joon-ho's most mature & accomplished film to date that finds the distinguished filmmaker at the apex of his craft, and further cements his position as one of the brightest storytellers of our generation."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"A film with a not very specific style. Average acting power, not so good screenplay, good direction, and overall an interesting and good movie, but not to the extent that the Oscar will give it the best picture. There were really better options to win in the movies of 2019. There are sequences in the movie that the viewer has no connection with and are just for the continuation of the movie, things happen that are not logical at all and the dialogues are extremely basic. I emphasize that the movie is a good movie for Korean cinema, but not to the extent of winning an Oscar. In the previous years, there have been much better movies in Korean cinema that did not receive any Oscar, such as Oldboy or Lady Vengeance. In general, I don't have anything else to say, I don't know, maybe I have a low cinema sense."
기생충,Parasite,2019,1,,"In spite of the excellent reviews, this movie was painful to watch and absolutely repulsive. It got worse the longer I watched. So, what's my problem? I'm a pretty intelligent, educated 75 year old, and I am willing to watch edgy stuff. I can list a dozen edgy foreign movies with subtitles that were excellent, set in Iran, Turkey, Lebanon, and South Korea, etc. There are many moviegoers like me who need a little affirmation of the human spirit in films. This film has none. And, the reviewers who have rated it so highly can only be suspect for there sense of humanity and value. Beware the Metascore!!!!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I have seen many films this decade, especially in 2019. However, though many have slipped to the back of my mind, Parasite is the movie title on the edge of my tongue when asked 'what movie do you recommend?' and will be until the next movie blows me away like Parasite did (this may be a while). I watched this movie a while ago but decided to voice my opinion after last lights Oscar success. Very rarely do I explain so little about a movie and just explain to the person 'just watch the movie' yet until you watch it, you won't undertsand why. True Masterpiece."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Bong Joon-ho strikes again with this modern art masterpiece, this movie literally blew my mind with its great combination of comedy and tragedy. One of the finest, perfect, enjoyable movies of this decade, Thanks to Bong Joon-ho and thanks to the seventh art who allows us to witness such beauty like this."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,I don't know how to start this I'm speechless!!  I don't want to spoil anything but WATCH IT!!
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"If you are hesitant to watch it because of the subtitles, don't be. This is a phenomenal movie which literally deserves it's own genre. It's intense, gritty yet subtle like- rollercoaster inside of a maze- type journey will leave you speechless at the end of this masterpiece."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I haven't watched many international films, mostly because I haven't been met with the opportunity of the will to actually go through with the commitment with finding the perfect film and taking my time to sustain it enough. But after hearing all the great reception of this movie I couldn't help but be intrigued enough to search for this movie. I was so happy when I saw it was playing in my local theatre, I rushed to go watch it with as little knowledge of the plot as possible, with the exception of the very vague trailer. And I'm glad the trailer I was shown was interesting enough to get my ass off to watch it but also vague enough to keep me at the edge of my seat the entire time I was watching it. This movie is simply amazing. You see this movie and you immediately feel and think ""masterpiece"". It is funny, dramatic, thrilling, scary, thought provoking, intriguing, depressing, it is everything one can expect from a movie. This premise kept taking many twists and turns I was never confused. The beginning was slow but I was never bored. The jokes land delightfully especially since it had to be translated from Korean. I couldn't believe a movie like this could actually exist until the last 20 minutes I was snapped back to reality and realized ""OH RIGHT THIS IS HAPPENING NOW"" I have nothing against movies in other languages and from other cultures but I honestly didn't think I was gonna be left this impressed. I feel terrible that I had been missing out on such phenomenal works of art. I will mostly definitely try to seek out more of this director's work. If this doesn't win Best Picture I will cry."
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"I liked Bong Joon-ho's The Host, didn't care for Snowpiercer, and while I thought Parasite was decent, I definitely don't consider it the best movie of 2019, nor did it live up to the hype I heard beforehand. I however don't think there's some conspiracy by the Academy Awards or other American institutions to put international movies above American ones for some sort of ""social justice"", and I'm perfectly OK with them choosing an international movie if they just think it was the best movie of the year. There's been a few years in my time where I thought a non-American movie was better than the American-made ones that year.  I was initially excited to see the movie, especially after hearing some hints of what it was about, and that it was a dark and stunning psychological take on people of different classes. I think class disparity is a huge problem in our country, so it felt very relevant. I also love dark psychological movies, but unfortunately after seeing this, I realized it wasn't that dark and wasn't that psychological. While it explores class disparity, neglect, and cruelty, there's so many problems with both the protagonists (if you can call them that) and antagonists (if that's really what they were).  The movie's biggest flaws are mostly in presentation, but some of the situations and actions of the characters are preposterous and feel very contrived. It's a riveting watch, is fairly well acted and directed, memorable, and has interesting situations, but too many times I had to suspend disbelief to an almost comical degree. The movie does have dark humor, which I appreciated, but I think some of it is unintended. This reminded me of Snowpiercer, as that had so many preposterous situations that I couldn't help but laugh. I think this is almost a signature of Bong Joon-ho, which worked well in The Host, but not so much in these other two movies. I haven't seen Mother, so I'm not sure if it's truly a common or intentional thread in his movies. I've enjoyed a lot of Korean movies, but I think Joon-ho may be overrated at this point.  I also think some of the violence is unnecessary and for shock value, and gets a bit overly-explicit, and some character's reaction to it is a bit odd and from my perspective a bit unbelievable and sometimes comes off as contrived. It seems in these more odd situations, Joon-ho is trying to make some sort of statement or point, which OK I think I understood, but I also don't like things like that being forced because they don't flow naturally with the storytelling and feel more wedged in. I don't know how political the movie is intended to be, but whether I agree with the points or not, I'd at least like a movie to have these ideas flow well and not be ratcheted in.  I would recommend this movie to people who enjoy Korean cinema, topics about class disparity, terror/horror drama, and maybe even just something different to the typical American movie norm. It is well-produced and generally well-directed, the characters and situations are memorable, you'll be shocked, but ultimately if you're anything like me, you'll be disappointed but glad you saw it too."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,Parasite is a must see film for the ages. It was fantastic a film that needs to be seen on the big screen. The acting was some of the best I have seen in years.  Parents this film is rated R for language sexual content and violence
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,I didn't feel their was enough buildup to justify the abrupt criminal act at the end of the movie. Felt contrived and forced.
기생충,Parasite,2019,2,,One of the most overrated movies i've ever seen. The hype was for nothing and everything was predictable.
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"I can sit here and talk about how the acting was, and what the parasite represents, how this movie can change the industry, and how the lightning and music was.. all the typical reviewer bull**** But I actually just wanna give this 10 stars and urge YOU to go watch it. Please do yourself the favor.. It's fantastic!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"I have never watched a Korean movie before, I really liked the movie and I recommend people to watch it. Great actors, great story & a masterpiece that you have to watch. The end of the movie is ok for me but I could be better"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,The movie is truly a masterpiece...! I don't understand how this movie with such local sentiments can deliver something that is so universal...!The best cinematic experience I had this year. Everything is perfect.
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Writer and director Bong Joon-ho has created a deranged masterpiece with Parasite. The first half of the movie was slow and repugnant to watch. Then, as the second half begins (when the former housekeeper shows up at night while the owners are away), it took a sharp turn into left field and became incredibly funny - though still very dark - and maintained the pace, humour and creativity right through to the end.  This is not a formulaic movie for Sheeple. If you like black comedy, originality, creativity, foreign/Korean films and bold storytelling, then this is the movie for you.  Laugh-out-loud, tears-in-eyes, wildly inventive stuff. Insane script, brilliant execution. Film art at its finest."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,The movie is a little bit dramatic but it portrays the inequality in every society. Full of twists too
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"As well crafted as this film is, with gorgeous cinematography, a decent soundtrack and brilliant acting, I just found it too much of a slow burner with no payoffs to justify it. I have been a fan of slow burners in the past, namely Interstellar and Bladerunner 2049 being two of my favourite films, yet they had arguably much better stories and spectacles throughout to make up for it. I heard Mark Kermode say this film delivers much of its plot visually yet I found the majority of the plot to be delivered with only dialogue or monologue. The supposed climax never really peaked enough, the horror wasn't all that tense or shocking and the comedy didn't land otherwise to carry it through. Furthermore, the references and foreshadowing throughout the film to later events could have been more creative. Finally, the 3rd act and ending felt like it could have been more meaningful and conveyed the Director's discourse with more conviction. Again, I don't want to deny the craftsmanship and deeper thinking into this film. There's some real consideration that's been put into this and a good attempt at making a pertinent and contemporary social commentary. Yet for me, it just didn't work. Nevertheless, I invite you to try this one out for yourself."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"A poor South Korean family lives in a ramshackle semi-basement apartment and gets by on hustles and cons. One day the son manages to get a job tutoring the child of a wealthy family. He sees an opportunity to get his parents and sister jobs in the household too. Soon all of them of are in and life is looking much rosier. Then fate throws them a curveball.  Superb. Written and directed by Bong Joon Ho who gave us the superb crime-drama Memories of Murder plus the entertaining Snowpiercer, Parasite is a great mix of comedy and drama, pathos and social commentary.  It starts off in very entertaining fashion as we meet the family that are experts in cons and manipulation. It is quite funny and initially they just seem like slackers. However, after a while it is quite awe-inspiring to see the work that goes into their deceptions.  As the movie progresses it becomes darker and darker. The plot takes on a few surprising twists and turns and the two families involved become symbols of a class divide. The social commentary is thought-provoking without being preachy or seeming biased. Powerful ending.  Solid performances round out an excellent plot and great direction."
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"The themes of this story are not just localized to Korea, however. They are the story of global capitalism, and the specter of American materialism (and imperialism; note the ""Indians"") looms heavily over the film. Meritocracy makes cannibals of us all. It's nice to dream, and sometimes the dreamers who plan and struggle well enough can indeed climb out of the basement and into the sunshine, and how nice an ending it is when they do. But the film also makes it clear that sometimes all that planning and dreaming may be, maybe, just whims and fancy. More often, it seems, our pipe dreams are content to leave us with nothing more than the whiff of spewed sewage.  The film was incredibly entertaining too. I can't think of a boring scene in this movie and yet on the surface for large parts of the film you would say not a lot is happening, at least in terms of action. Fascinating characters and brilliant dialogue are what create this."
기생충,Parasite,2019,5,,All I wish to say is do not go by the rating or the hype. It is an average movie but with a slightly better storyline. There are way too many movies which are much much better.
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,Best Movie 2020 . Sure Shot Oscar In every Compition . Worth watching .
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,After watching the film I continued to run the film through my mind. The way the writers put subtle flashes to in your face current social climate issues was probably one of my favorite things about the film. Like other reviews I agree that it's almost two films in one. You will leave with internal questions and possibilities of different ending that could happen.
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Story All unemployed, Ki-taek and his family take peculiar interest in the wealthy and glamorous Parks, as they ingratiate themselves into their lives and get entangled in an unexpected incident. REVIEW As the title suggests PARASITE..it symbolizes the entire plot of the film..the film starts off at a comedy film.. And slowly it turns into a intense thriller.. And finally into a horror film... The film focuses about the rich and poor.. Their goals and aims which bother us.. Exactly before the interval and the climax.. Characters in the film lay a foundation of extreme cinematic experience which was all spine chilling and mind boggling for sure.. The performance delivered by the KOREAN actors was stupendous and flawless.. The details introduced by the director was truly a masterpiece.. It was a great experience.. RATING 4.0/5.0"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"First impressions: A striking contrast between the visual ambiance (smooth or pastel colors, cute) and the story (super dark).  It kind of recalled me A Clockwork Orange somehow. The dark humor, manipulations, the underlying terror settling in, the sudden violence, the social questioning."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,Such a great unique master piece! the kind of movie that surprises you. its hard to know whats coming next.
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"It's straight up an exploitation thriller, where the equivalent of korean rednecks, finally getting their chance to exploit and abuse the well to do. ( which in this movie is not even portrayed as being amoral or deserving it in some other ways )  filmed well, acted well, good thrills, but as expected in this genre, a shocking ending and a messy denouement.  But nothing special  for professional and amateur critics to comment that this is a rumination on class struggle, oppression of the poor and the comeuppance for the rich, just shows that they either never watched the film and allowed whatever political prejudice they have to write the film criticism for them, or that they are easily swayed by these professional critics."
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"I loved this: it only came out in the UK this weekend and I needed to see it before the oscar winners were announced. The use of colour, space and sound is superb. The actors are perfect and it's just wonderfully funny and thrilling at the same time. I found it a little slow to get into but it was worth the effort: the poor of society are so often treated as like cockroaches; a different species, parasitic, work shy, undeserving. And, as one of the characters points out, if we were wealthy how much easier would it be for us to be kind and generous people? The wealthy here are not evil, simply oblivious."
기생충,Parasite,2019,3,,"The movie is bad quality, and seeing people trying to feel good about their social sensibility upon a garbage like this is to see how lost people are nowadays."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,Amazing job all around from all that were involved in making this masterpiece. It starts slow but trust me stay along for the ride because at the end you will just say WOW !!!
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"The movie is like a travel on its own, good details and an amazing story. It covers all the genres in one."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"NEVER seen a movie like this. Wow what a masterpiece! Twist after twist, it had it ALL!!!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"The less you know about this movie heading in, the better. Parasite is a wonderfully original film from South Korea that manages to mix several genres together perfectly. This tale about class is filled with poignant metaphors and social commentary. Bong Joon Ho's vision and mesmerizing control over his craft make for an unforgettable experience.  This isn't a simple rich vs poor story where there are clear protagonists or antagonists, and therein lies the beauty of Parasite. It's just murky enough to provide some true thought-provoking imagery and storytelling. Don't let the one inch barrier of subtitles prevent you from seeing this modern masterpiece."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Just like the movie The Shape of Water ..... this movie is for all intensive purposes banned in Canada .....  From the Cineplex site: The movie Parasite (Korean w/e.s.t.) is not playing in TORONTO - ON on 11/16/2019  It is playing in Oakville in 1 theater. I will play the local art theater that seats 30 in my town later this month.  Interestingly, Google Play has this movie and even has reviews BUT it is not rent-able or buy-able in Canada.  Parasite is about the caste systems that operate worldwide, including Canada .... and is a taboo topic"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Parasite tells the story of a poor family in South Korea. Kim Ki-taek(Kang-ho Song), his wife Kim Chung-sook(Hye-jin Jang), son Kim Ki-woo(Woo-sik Choi) & daughter Kim Ki-jung(So-dam Park), start working for the super rich Park family. Soon, things start getting complicated.  Parasite is a jaw-dropping film. Director Bong Joon Ho has given us another unforgettable movie, after The Host(2006), Snowpiercer(2013) & Okja(2017). Parasite has so many levels & nuances to it. This film, makes you experience a whirlwind of emotions. You'll laugh, you'll be on the edge of your seat, you'll be shocked, you'll be teary-eyed & you will be left ruminating about the movie, long after the credits roll. The performances are mind-blowing. Kang-ho Song is spectacular as Kim Ki-taek. Sun-kyun Lee is brilliant as Park Dong-ik. Yeo-jeong Jo is amazing as Park Yeon-kyo. Woo-sik Choi is outstanding as Kim Ki-woo. So-dam Park is fantastic as Kim Ki-jung. Jeong-eun Lee is excellent as Moon-gwang. Hye-jin Jang is awesome as Kim Chung-sook. Ji-so Jung is great as Park Da-hye. Myeong-hoon Park is superb as Geun-se. The supporting cast is memorable. Parasite is a must watch. It deserves all the awards it has received so far & deserves its six Oscar nominations. Definitely one of the best films of the year, whether it's English, Korean or any other language!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,For me this movie give uncomfortable feeling... Even though it has nice first half... I don't why this movie got Oscar 😒
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"What we can? Why we can? When we can? There are questions in film,the black comedy is a great genre to present a real life in a political empoilment country. All of characters are very powerfull psychology and moral to complete a they psychology. Powerfull and colorfull story on the screen!  Great job,guys!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"I don't mind symbolism. I think it adds extra depth to a story, granted you're looking for it. But if a story cannot exist strongly without symbolism...it's not really a story worth telling. This was one of them. The locations ran old after a very short amount of time and the ending was SO long and drawn out. And to come to what conclusion? Pretty flimsy."
기생충,Parasite,2019,1,,"....and I thought ""The Shape of Water"" was a horrible Best Picture winner. ""Joker."" ""1917."" ""Once Upon a Time In Hollywood."" They all lose to....this? I just might be done watching the Academy Awards."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Review: 'Parasite' is a black comedy-thriller film directed by Bong Joon-ho. I personally love foreign films, especial horror and thriller films from South Korea. I have loved every movie I have seen thus far of director Bong Joon Ho's and this is no different. The film follows the members of a poor household scheming to become employees of a much wealthier family by posing as unrelated, highly qualified individuals. The actors in this movie bring their A-game and showcase all different levels on the screen. There are all able to showcase their comedic side as well as darker capabilities when needed. This is the rare occasion when there are no standouts because there are on the same level. Just brilliant performances all around. The story is so original and tightly executed. It may get a little confusing because things tend to happen quickly, and information can get lost. It is beautiful shot, this its camera angles and wide shots inside the house. It showcases different class types in society perfectly and how some rich look down on the poor and it gets under your skin. Overall, the movie is great for those who don't mind subtitles. However, if you do mind subtitles or have not tried foreign film, I promise you that you're missing out on a whole other world of cinema. I was going to give this movie 4.5 stars because I didn't just want to jump on the bandwagon with people loving this movie, but it deserves more than that. It is an absolutely flawless film. 5/5"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Jumping on the post-Oscar win bandwagon, I went to see this film today. Having heard the near unanimous praise from peers and other reviews, I had high expectations for this film. It was also the first Korean film I watched. The movie starts, and I'm literally glued to my seat-it was very entertaining. The camera movement, the way the characters speaks, the overall pacing, the black comedy tone-everything was just so freshly packaged, I wanted a refill the moment the movie was over. A predominant theme of this movie is the class structure-from a non-Korean's point of view it was quite clear and somewhat tragic to see. If I had one problem with this film, I think some of the class struggle content was probably too overt (especially in the dialogue) and could have been handled more subtly. Despite that, it is definitely a film that deserved all the accolades it received. It is first movie that I watched in theaters where I instantly wanted to rewatch it. Now that folks, is entertainment."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"The storyline, cinematography, is very very delight"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,Best movie in 2019 really it fantastic I really enjoyed and loved a actors and I feeled I was lived with them that is the first Korea move I ever watch
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,I thought that this was definetly one generic movie (everything nice-something happens- that situation is solved) but it was not. I was amazed by the expression that the director has put on this film. Very nice original story and graphism. I would recommend everyone to watch this. This movie truly deserved the oscar.
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,I am grateful to have learned to read early and not have problems with subtitles. Americans should try a little to be less lazy.
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"After all the hype I came away from this film terribly disappointed. I gave it 6/10 because the beginning captured me, then sadly the whole plot got lost in the brutality. I have seen better films about Rich and Poor come out of South Korea. Sadly this is not one of them.  The story lacked good direction, and logic. It felt like the writers were struggling with the whole flow of the plot. Not something I could recommend as a must see."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Bong Joon Ho's absolutely brilliant and powerful masterpiece is a sheer work of cinematic art. It tells the twisted, funny, and ultimately tragic tale of class discrimination and greed. About an dirt-poor Korean family that lives in cramped half basement level apartment where drunks regularly piss and throw-up outside their window. The out of work father Kim Ki-Taek, played terrifically by Song Kang Ho, helps his wife Chung Sook, well played by Jang Hye Jin, and his two children, son Ki-Woo and daughter Ki-Jeong, superbly played by Chi Woo Shik and Park So Dam, fold food boxes for a pitiful low-wage, but that all is about to change and a sinister plan is about to come into play, when Ki-Woo with the assistance of of his sister who creates a fraudulent diploma which helps him secure a job as an English tutor for the teenage daughter of the super wealthy Mr. Park and his naive wife, Yeon-kyo, marvelously played by Lee Sun Kyun and Cho Yeo Jeong. Miss Kim is so impressed by Ki-Woo's teaching skills that she mentions to him that her younger son needs a tutor to improve his art skills, so Ki-Woo recommends an art tutor which unbeknownst to her is his sister Ki-Jeong. What follows is the escalation of the Kim family's nefarious scam as they slowly make the Park family replace their household servants, beginning with their chauffeur, who is replaced by K-Woo's father, then they replace their live-in housekeeper, with Ki-Woo's mother. The Kims have now thoroughly invaded and occupied the Park's home without them suspecting anything, but this insidious situation will soon turn dangerous and deadly in a truly shocking climax. This amazing film is a slow burn in the beginning as the story unfolds but once the Kims are in the Park's home the film becomes an engrossing and breathtaking dark drama with some wicked humor. Masterful Oscar nominated direction by Bong Joon Ho who was first Korean filmmaker to win the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Gorgeous cinematography by Kyung-pyo Hong, and a captivating Oscar nominated Original Screenplay by Bong Joon Ho and Jin Won Han, impressive Oscar nominated Production Design by Ha-jun Lee and Won-Woo cho. A new classic that is nominated for 6 Academy Awards including Best Picture. In Korean with English subtitles."
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,Did i just watched a different movie ? I don't Know after reading all reviews i was quite excited and had hopes on this film. The overall concept of this film is good but definitely overrated i watched many films better than this which the critics and audience failed to appreciate. But this one is not up to the hype that the critics .
기생충,Parasite,2019,1,,"Absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever had to sit through. Despicable characters, a drawn out storyline, and annoying dialogue made the enjoyable act of movie watching a chore."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,A must watch .. mesmerising with mixed overwhelming feelings throughout the two hours.. it doesn't leave you after it ends; you cannot help but continue think of what if!
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"""A waterproof toy tent, and a semi-basement house that got flooded"""
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Precise acting, meticulous editing, meaningful story, dramatically funny story telling, inspiring ending, unnoticeable yet tangible music, ...multi oscar material."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"This movie is about so much more than class differences. It's survival,what you would do for your family. Preconceived ideas of peoples worth and actions. I was so nervous as the film came to a close. It was very intriguing! Wonderful!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"This movie is really reflect the truth of society, not even in Korean but many country around the world.  The story is about the class differences in the society of Korean. The poor people want to have a better life to lived with rich people or be equal to rich people.  It was an interesting movie. Reccommended.  The end of the movie is not something I expected to see.  Eventhought I don't like the end of the story that much but have to admitted that this is a good movie, it was something new worthing for the reward.  The gab between rich and wealthy people and poor people was really real thing."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I just this for the second time in cinemas and I loved it just as much as the first time. I cannot describe how thankful I am that this gem has been given a wide release in Australia before most countries, which is a rare occurrence, especially with foreign films.  The first time I saw this, I was absolutely enthralled by it because of the unique story being presented. I found it to be witty yet subversive, and I had no idea where it was headed. Bong-Joon Ho is a director who's work that I've seen at this point is something I greatly appreciate. He always manages to pull genuinely funny comedy out of his scenes that somehow feels natural rather than jarring. It doesn't diminish from the story's overall seriousness, nor does it ditract from the dramatic performances of the cast, especially Song Kang-Ho, who I have not seen give a performance that was not great yet. Where the story did head completely caught me off guard, but in a good way. It is one of the best uses of plot escalation I have seen in a long time, to the point where the film completely changes genres halfway through and it's astounding because it works so well. The stylistic features change with the tone shift as well, as the score becomes more tense and dramatic, and the camera movement becomes more sweeping and eratic. It's all so perfectly complementary to what's escalating on screen. The cinematography is so good that any shot could be used as the poster, and it would make good one at that.  The second time I saw this I payed extra attention to any hints or details that are presented which set up the escalation to come, and it was a truly rewarding experience. I think there's still things I won't pick up until my third or fourth viewing.  I absolutely adore this film, and I think everyone should check it out. I would even recommend it to those who confess to not liking foreign films because they have to go through the gruelling task of actually having to read what they're watching. This is my favourite of 2019 so far, and I would be very surprised if that changed from now."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"This will most likely be in the top 5 list of Korean films for all time. Its an absolute masterpiece of genre subtlety that had me engrossed from the very beginning. It had already been out quite some time before I got to watching it because, I just wasn't drawn to it in any way. It came across as boring to me whilst reading the studio advertisement blurb. Luckily on one of those rainy day moments, not knowing what I fancied watching, I finally opted to watch it; and so pleased I did.  Its a simple story of the existing life of poverty in South Korea (many people are destitute but the government hides it) and, a simple piece of luck that spiraled out of control into a full blown scam. The main 4 antagonists of the story are a deadbeat father, a miserable grumpy mother, a selfish foul mouthed daughter with the in your face attitude that kids have today and finally, a son who is the only decent person in the family and wants to better himself and his lifestyle.  The way the individual actors portray their character roles is of extremely Oscar worthy performances. Everything is carried out in such a calm, peaceful and laid back manner; except for a bit of mayhem, at a garden party, at the closing stages of the film.  Bad Language: YES...and not really necessary for the film... Sex: NO...but some totally unneeded intimate lewd groping scenes... Not a Family film but a superb one for the 16 and over viewers!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"The subtitles might be a bit much for non-koreans but the movie more than makes up for it. I complained when it won eight million academy awards because of all the other great movies but now see why it is so praised. A serious contender for ""Movies better than Old Boy""."
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,This is a great movie and exciting scenario except from the ending. The Oscars awards lost its reputation in my eyes. The movie definitely doesn't deserve an Oscar and if it's the opposite then I'm the cruelest critic ever!!!
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,Done very well even the topic is not new. The casting fits like a glove and their acting is great. However the ending is disappointing and rushed - they could have done much better than that!
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"Plot is perfect. there is just no flaw that is even slightly noticed. acting of all cast members are good. music accompanies scenes very well. the movie covers all genres without making any too much. funny, touching, suspending, sexual, family moments are all there, even horror ones. what left in your mind is a subtle yet powerful message about class discrimination in Korea. It truly deserves the Oscar without needing to employ politics or racial issues."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"I already saw the comment on capitalism and the other layers of human nature and relationships other times in other films. I'm not saying it's a bad movie, maybe that's on me and my expectations."
기생충,Parasite,2019,1,,"It makes no sense of the situations. Some scenes were good but the movie is too long for the story. Also, the plot is very predecible in a lot of things. I don't recommend this movie."
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"It took some years for me to finally see this movie and I'm still not sure how to place it.  The most important thing about this movie is its message.  It's about the Kim family living their harsh life in South Korea as they are without a job and without any perspective. On the opposite there is the Park Family living a privileged life in their luxurious home.  By coincidence both lives get tangled up and there are apparently two worlds colliding. The story is very witty and the movie is sometimes funny, sometimes dark but never boring.  For me this movie is quite entertaining but not that mind-blowing as some might think."
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"It's easy to see why Parasite got so many Oscars. It's in that classic Oscar winning style of being quite artsy and something totally un-blockbuster like. These are always going to be movies that are enjoyable and have a great story to tell rather than just being about a feast of action for the eyes. Parasite has such a strange mix of humour and horror towards the end. Overall the biggest takeaway is the contrast between rich and poor. It takes you through such a stark contrast and the perceptions of both sides. The flood was a great example, for one family a bit of fun, for another you lose everything you own. In the end, we cannot assume that we would not behave in similar ways when we have had everything taken away from us and we are losing our lives. Quirky, but interesting."
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"One of the most over-rated movie of last years. Rated as 30th best movie of all time? It can be in 150 but no more. Not that realistic (not because its comedy style, because it has wrong parts), detailed and effective storyline. It has wrong parts that could not happen, the nonsense parts I mean. I also watched Memories Of Murder, not so different than this movie, but Parasite is so over-rated. Over-rated on websites and Academy Awards. I don't know how can be this movie the first Best Picture winner with foreign language. I know the Best Picture awards are not quite very well chosen. But we have seen amazing tens of movies from Italy, Spain, Turkey, Japan, Germany but none of them won the Best Picture in 100 years and this one won? Not that amazing and the other nominations was not that bad. Academy Awards only well chosen on Actor and Actress awards."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"First things first, this movie has an incredible cast, all acting their roles with precision on the more serious times and humour when needed. Visually this movie was solid, with the camrea set-ups being almost poetic. I love the idea of infulltration and contrast in this movie, the idea of contradiction is very prevelant and very well done. This also has one of the tightest screenplays I've seen in a very long time, every single peice of dialouge contributes towards which every setpeice they are trying to sep up. The humour of this movie was absolutley spot on too, delivering clever and defining moments for almost every charcter."
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"Being poor sucks and there is no poetry in misery: it stunts your emotional and sometimes even physical growth. Sometimes you can fight back and improve, sometimes you are just have to suck it up and surrender, which makes you bitter and angry. This is what this movie is about: the loss of innocence of the poor and the blessed naivety of the rich."
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"This film has one of the most compelling premises and buildups in of any film in recent years.  However, the ending left me rather cool and I felt that a story with such a gripping narrative should have something a little more well thought out.  It's almost as if there is a genre switch near the end of the film. Where it goes from psychological drama to cartoonish over the top horror. I'm interested to know if there was studio intervention on this point because it almost feels like another filmmaker took over.  Unfortunately, this bend basically broke the reality of the film for me. But the primary build up of the film is so great its still definitely worth a watch."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,Honestly this movie is definitely one that lived up to the hype and deserved every single accolade and award. if you can watch a movie without staring at your phone for the majority of the film in this day and age it's definitely because the movie is capturing .. it had me hooked for 2 hours without being distracted
기생충,Parasite,2019,,,"I'm afraid to say this movie is evidence to the press, PR and political agenda driven bile we are subjected to daily. Basically, it's 100% over hyped. The emperors new clothes is an hour too long. It's a terribly crass, dull story that's simply well shot. The movie and it's PR machine and subsequent Oscars are an insult to the peoples intelligence. If constipation is your favoured hobby, dive in. If not... avoid."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"Just watched the movie and can't say it lives up to the hype around it. It had funny moments, thriller moments and a message. It was interesting overall but the ending could have been better. I wouldn't recommend this film to a friend, for instance. Not because it was bad but because I felt that it was missing something."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Parasite is done exactly how a perfect film should be.  The exposition introduces the characters, their personality and characteristics, their significance, and what they mean in the context of the film in a way that is interesting, well-paced, and fresh. I deeply cared for the well-being and outcome of all these characters, and found myself taking their perspective and cheering on their misadventures. It's a difficult task to get an American audience to connect with an impoverished Korean family, but Bong Joon-ho does it perfectly.  The narrative element is used more to paint a conceptual picture, giving us insight into the ambitions and motives behind the characters. The film takes long winding turns. Viewers who go in expecting an easy watch or a simple lesson are going to get much more than they anticipated.  The film also does well to never put itself in a box. At times it is comedic, often thrilling, very dramatic, and sometimes even horrific. It has highlights in all categories of appeal.  I have nothing bad to say. This is the first film I've watched where I was sure that every moment was done exactly right."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"A beautiful journey of emotions. Delivers a strong subject, so interestingly and with a bunch of great actors, incredibly directed by Mr.Bong  A very important film. Kangsammidha"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Social satire movies usually are serious, but Bong made this movie so thrilling & fun to watch. It will both make & ruin your day."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Nice and deep, great movie! This Korean palm is worthy of the name!!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"At first, you'll see it as a comedy, but then the director take you on a magical mystery ride and you'll never know what waiting for you up ahead. 10/10 a must watch movie"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,Movies are about people. And this movie described struggle of lower class. A beatiful piece.
기생충,Parasite,2019,,,"Parasite, a South Korean cinematic gem, masterfully unravels the complex layers of class divide and human nature from an Asian perspective. With its intricate storytelling and stunning visuals, it delves deep into themes of ambition, desperation, and the struggle for survival, resonating strongly with Asian audiences. This film not only offers a gripping narrative but also reflects on the societal structures and the stark realities of wealth disparity in Asia. Its profound impact on viewers highlights the universal relevance of its themes, making Parasite a pivotal work in global cinema that engages and enlightens."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"Given the overall rating on IMDB, I was expecting something a little bit more. It's a nice idea, and well executed for the most part. The ending...hmm. Perhaps it works in Korean culture but I found it disappointing, and it seemed to me that the writer just ran out of steam.  But overall worth a look. The humorous touches were great."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,The storytelling is amazing! Bong Joon Ho did it again.
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"Let's start with that I've seen a lot. It's all public. In the most cases meta's score given to a movie shows a better rating, a more realistic one compared to imdb.  I've seen 1917, I was sick of that people don't even know what cinematography is. The whole movie was made like ""Rope"" except that Rope had an amazingly interesting story. 1917 had nothing in it. Paths of Glory was in many terms a lot more realistic. Long story short, I didn't like 1917 at all. I had no idea why it was even nominated.  Then I saw the Marriage Story. As soon as I realised Adam Driver is in it (Star Wars guy), I just wanted to not like the movie because I don't like the new SW movies at all. Then it turned out it was amazing. He was very good, the movie was very good. I liked The Irishman too but the Marriage Story was superior.  Then came the awards and Parasite won. I saw it has a score of 8.6 and I know the director. He did a crime movie which I liked (Memories of a Murder). That one was very good.  So I just watched Parasite too.  It was interesting, but maybe I've seen too many actually good movies, so I do not blow my mind just like that.  The characters were ok and maybe that's all. The story was just interesting. There was nothing special about it. It was an original story, but it won't make it good. It has nothing to tell us. It's pretty much like a half written mess. If somebody works for me for years, I won't fire him/her just because a tale someone told me. I would atleast question the worker. Atleast! At this point the movie was very unrealistic.  The smell factor. We can't smell it :) But all that food as whiskey on that table has a strong smell. You can clearly see under the table. I just had no idea how is that realistic.. They were all given good wages and still they didn't take a shower or anything like that. They did all smell bad.. Sooo unrealistic and because of it the father's motivation made absolute no sense. No sense at all. Especially in that situation.  It felt like they had to end the story somehow and they chose this way for some reason.  Other factors of the movie are no special neither.  Roma stands on 7.7 and is by far better in every aspect.  Currently I've rated over 2500 movies, I write scripts, I'm working on to direct one of my works myself and I have to tell you that this movie was just OK and I have really no idea why would anyone give it a score of 8 or higher. If I would write and direct a movie like this, I would be not satisfied. Not at all. For me it was 6.5 as it was interesting. Also it's genre is drama/thriller. There was not a single second in the movie that was comedic!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,1,,I'm not asking anyone to agree with me ... but I did not find this film beautiful moving or touching in any way shape or form... nothing that happened in this film was believable... and if we just give out acadamy awards for a bunch of random crap happening in a movie .... there is a reason this one won 4... don't fall for the hype and accidentally pay for this film like I did... waste of money and time...
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Parasite is a masterpiece, an unpredictable film about class division that skillfully manages to easily combine different genres and create a truly unique and complex experience that's smart, funny and tense. All of the performances are incredible with Kang-ho Song, Woo-sik Choi and So-dam Park giving the standout performances. Bong Joon-ho's direction is incredible, it's beautifully filmed and the pacing is superb, constantly extremely engaging for the entirety of its run time. The music by Jung Jae-il is amazing."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,Absolutely Fantastic. The best movie i've seen in my life.
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Parasite (noun) - a person who habitually relies on or exploits others and gives nothing in return.  This movie is one hell of a ride, it has a lot of unpredictable twists and turns which will make the viewers curious what will happen next. One of 2019's best. I loved the whole cast in this one."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"A haunting parable, with so many stark images that will forever be burned into my brain. A pointed highlight of the differences between the haves and have-nots. A sublimely original movie that's full of surprises and unnerving but hilarious anxiety."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"A really good movie, that deserved the Oscar, i was cheering for Joker but what the hell right?"
기생충,Parasite,2019,,,"This movies is such an incredible and well planned movie. Every aspect is incredible. After watching it for the first time, I just sat there for what felt like ten minutes, just processing everything that I just watched. Bong Joon Ho has such an amazing way of expressing how both families interact with each other. It was so cool to watch an endless amount of YouTube videos explaining how this shot was performed or what the symbolism for this object means. There's so much detail to this movie and is the gateway drug into people getting into film. It's what has gotten me into film afterall. 100% recommend."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"O What I enjoyed most about Parasite is the complete culture shock: from a ""Western"" perspective, very few people will have seen a film like this. The mannerisms of the cast (both the rich socialites and the lowly main characters) is unique to this film, along with the settings used throughout the movie. This not only delivers novel cinematography, but combined with this unique story, Parasite is worth watching for the experience alone. The acting is strong right through the story, with some excellent framing and shot shaping to emphasise certain points. By the end, you can see what got Bong Joon-ho nominated for all these awards - and you would have to agree, he probably deserved to win most of them too."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I love Breaking Bad. I watched the entirety of it three times. But at the first go, it took getting to season 4, episode 11 (Crawl Space) for my mind to go numb from the intensity, and to season 5, episode 14 (Ozymandias) for it to crumble. That is how long it took me to understand the hype.  Parasite did it in less than 2 hours."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"I felt there was a lot of unused themes, like the Chekhov's gun principle and the family was fairly smart but jobless, it doesn't fit. More goofy than a masterpiece. All in all it was a decent movie and worth my time, I think its rating though is inflated by the social class messages throughout the movie."
기생충,Parasite,2019,1,,"Everybody and his aunts seem to love this movie - and I can't figure out why. Yes, it's technically well done but so what, many movies are well done. There is not on character of interest to me and nothing makes sense to me."
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"This movie paints a picture of necessity. One family needs to survive, another to to thrive, and when the tempo clash, there will be casualties on both sides. Life goes on for both families, but it shows that the less fortunate are more prone to violence."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Bong Joon Ho's chilling satirical masterpiece addresses the age old theme of social class. Much like Bong Joon Ho's previous work, Snowpiecer (2013), the question of why some people are seen as ""lower"" and some people are seen as ""higher"" class is asked. The film also explores what we have to sacrifice to change social classes under a capitalist system. The narrative follows the Kims, a poor family who con their way into becoming the servants of a rich family, the Parks. Their easy life gets complicated when their deception is threatened with exposure. What follows is a fascinating spectacle which is sometimes operatic in nature and a sad reflection of modern life. Although it is all set in South Korea, the story works so well because it is universal and could have been set practically anywhere. It could be argued that there are no villains in the film, just people; however, it is anything but a soap opera. It is a commentary on the human condition. Nothing is black and white, just shades of grey. Parasite offers a way of seeing the world which feels unlike anything most Western audiences have seen before. However, there are still some films which it does bear some stylistic similarities to. Hitchcock comes to mind with films such as Psycho (1960) and The Birds (1963). There is also a twist in the tail which does feel slightly Hitchcockian. I could also see traces of films with a more biblical and spiritual quality to them such as Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia (1999). The acting was convincing throughout with stand out performances from Kang-ho Song and Sun-kyun Lee which puts the audience on edge. The spider-like way Bong Joon Ho directed his cast to move added to the sense of uneasiness. The writing is spot on with some razor sharp wit which, combined with the direction, made for some side-splitting moments. However as a contrast to the more humorous points in the film, there are moments of real sadness and pain. The contrasts beautifully represent life, because what is life if not a series of contrasts?"
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"Love to see movies that are different than what comes out of USA studios, and this one was unique and fresh. After seeing it I have added Seoul as my next destination, it just will not happenduring rainy season. 🤣  This film showed that life is not so different around the world. For example the way the rich folk in this film looked on the downtrodden folk; it reminded me of life in 1970s when I grew up in South America.  Yes it merits the awards it received at the Oscars."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"The movie is very well planned, if the viewer isn't watching closely he or she may lose a few details that make this movie so great. The movie makes people feel every type of emocion and makes you understand different types of realities... I really recommend and better to watch it without any clue of what is about to happen."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I always respected Academy for their independence and the best professional group of critics in cinematography in the world. They didn't hesitate to award Parasite with 4 Oscars in the most important categories.  I watched Parasite over and over again since Cannes award. The progression of the film storyline is amazing as every episode links each other seamlessly but with more deeper tensions.  The intermission was when Mr. Park's family was away for camping. Director Bong probably wanted to provide the audiance a moment to enjoy, relax but with the thunderstorm the fatal second half deploys.  This movie embraces all genre (I would call it neo-genre by Bong) and detailed beauty of the social diversity unfold to its extream.  I have a habit of reading reviews before choosing films and especially I read most of the reviews just before the Oscars announcement. Most of the IMDB members left 8-10 (mostly 10) but after the awards, I can see unexplainable reviews 1 or 2 with non-sense. I know it's out of jealousy and lack of understanding for the Korean films. Hope you watch Parasite again and rethink..."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"I really liked the movie a lot. It is extraordinary. The plot is a unique masterpiece. Like most Korean movies, it is maybe not for everyone's stomach. It is a brutal, honest and a raw dark comedy, which has a deeper meaning that progresses throughout the whole movie and punches you at the end with a knockout twist. It replicates the cold and honest reality of the outside world of poor and rich differences. So, whoever wants to experience a thrilling push of harsh reality, packed into a metaphoric world of class diversity and the struggle between them, has to see this movie."
기생충,Parasite,2019,1,,After all the hype about this film and the number of awards I was very left feeling very disappointed with this film. Whilst it may have achieved what it set out to be. It seemed neither one thing nor the other. For the most part I found it completely predictable.
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"After watching this, I could not stop thinking about it for several days. After the second watch, I noticed several other easter eggs, hidden gems that neatly tied all of the themes together.  THIS is how movies should be made. I had expected 1917 to win all the awards, but after seeing this, I knew this was the movie that should sweep this years Oscars.  And finally, the Oscars got it right in choosing a foreign-language film as Best Picture winner. And it's not hard to see why. Despite it being set in South Korea, it incorporates universal themes such as poverty, trying whatever it takes to get your family a better life and class differences.  Rightfully, they'll be talking about this film for decades."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"What a great movie, bravo.. bong direct this movie up to the mark. fantastic"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I loved this movie so much! The film is interesting, thought provoking, there is drama, comedy and an impressive plot twist. All my friends who watched it liked and so did I. I watched the film in Korean with Brazilian Portuguese subtitles, I think it is important to watch the film in its own language. Song Kang-ho is an excellent actor, I really liked his work. The first film I've watched with him was ""A Taxi Driver"" (2017), another awesome filme about some events of the Gwangju Uprising in 1980. After watching Parasite, I was very inclined and interested in looking for other Bong Joon-ho's films."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"Performance: Both Kim and Park family members did brilliant job in their role. Kim family was full of cunning and witty one however Park family was simple and soft one. Both family depicted their side perfectly.  Direction: Bong is the captain of this dark comedy with lots of thriller. Just like he baked dark comedy cinema as a cake and added thriller like a cherry on the top of the cake. Execution matters a lot when you are talking about top quality cinema and this is one of them.  Script: This is the main USP of this movie. Although this movie available in the English subtitle, still you are able to relate and enjoy this cinema completely. Great showcase of the difference between elite class and poor people. Some small object played pivot role e.g. Smell, Morse Code  Background Score: As movie flow, background score provided perfect combination to it. For this genre, great background score is key to entertain the audience.  Last Words: Don't miss it otherwise isme tera ghata."
기생충,Parasite,2019,,,"There are times where we really deserve a good thrill from a good movie. If you're looking for one, then ""Parasite"" is one hell of a cinematic ride to take.  Bong Joon-ho's direction calls back to the brilliant direction a master like Hitchcock would provide, which would be full of unique visuals and stellar composition. And, since I'm on the topic of masters, I am convinced that Director Bong Joon-ho will go down as not just a master of the directing craft, but also of the screenwriting craft. The screenplay, which he co-wrote with Han Jin-won, is full of not just so many twists and turns, but filled with so much genre-bending twists that there's never a moment where you feel the trope is overused. Both Bong and Han clearly know how to write a screenplay that is just as effective as say a screenplay like the one for ""Chinatown.""  Then comes the performances of the cast. This film is a prime example of casting done right. Song Kang-ho plays Kim Ki-taek, the father of the poor Kim family desperate to break the boundaries set by classism and infiltrate the luxurious home of the Park family, with Lee Sun-kyun and Cho Yeo-jeong playing the father and mother, respectfully. Every single actor in this films shines like cinematic gold in their respectful roles.  So, if you like films that are original, imaginative, thrilling, and oh-so brilliant acted, written, and directed, then please. Give Parasite a go. I promise, you will be in for a surprised. A really big one."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"Let me say right away here that ""Parasite"" may very well indeed be even better than a 7/10 star film. For my viewing experience, there were a number of factors that may well have dampened the overall experience. No matter how you slice it, though, ""Parasite"" is a solid metaphor film that engages both on surface and deep levels.  For a very basic overview, this film focuses on two families in South Korea: The Kims are the definition of poor, living in a cramped sub-street level apartment and barely scraping together enough to subside. The Parks are much wealthier, living in a spacious mansion and employee tutors, drivers, and a housekeeper. Through a serious of events both fortuitous and comical, all four Kims become employed (in varying capacities) by the Kims. The juxtaposition between ""clans"" is readily apparent, and brought to an even starker contrast when a momentous discovery changes/defines the entire back half of the film's narrative.  On the surface, ""Parasite"" is pretty entertaining, using a multi-genre approach to keep the viewer's interest. While watching, you will be treated to comedy, drama, farce, seriousness, etc. There is never a dull moment, in other words, and the acting is strong throughout. The subtitles only take a few minutes to get used to (from an American viewer perspective) and will quickly become second nature, so don't let that be the reason you may shy away from this movie.  More importantly, though, ""Parasite"" is also very much a metaphor movie, dealing with class structures and the fundamentals of capitalism itself. I won't go into spoiler details here, but there are much deeper meanings here than simply what is visually/physically portrayed. Multiple, deeper readings/viewings of the material are very easy to pick out and analyze.  Like I said in the opening paragraph, ""Parasite"" may be objectively higher than 7/10 stars. For me, though, it was watched during a nationwide pandemic state, in which it was hard to focus on the issues these filmmakers wanted to put forth. Also, and this is very much a personal preference, I prefer metaphor films to ""sneak up on me"" as opposed to knowing that going in. With this film, though, the cat was out of the bag after the Academy Awards, which is when it will garner the majority of its popular viewings. So, I knew to look for the ""deeper stuff"" from the get-go, and I feel like that may have influenced by overall viewing experience (and perhaps not for the better).  So, as of right now, I'm giving ""Parasite"" a 7/10 ranking. A solid film that I enjoyed, but not necessarily amongst my personal all-time favorites. Perhaps upon a second viewing in a different personal/social climate, it will climb the ranks further. It certainly won't go any lower."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,The powerful plot throws up some brilliant twists that could never have been guessed upon. Parasite clearly portrayed what class division in a society. A brilliant masterpiece that deserves to be watched and felt upon!! Highly recommended if you like korean movies.
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"Definitely a nice movie to watch. Extreme and unreal situations with scenes that will keep you on your toes. Funny at times and dramatic at others. Acting was very good and the characters were played very well. I don't thing its a movie that you would watch again though, thus 7."
기생충,Parasite,2019,1,,"Repulsive story, highly prejudiced. The movie deals very unsuccessfully with the topic of social class struggle. Basically, the movie offers a violent tale of resentment and inverse snobbery. The rich are stupid and undeserving, the poor are a brotherhood of crooks, etc. It both denigrates rich and poor at the same time. It criticises capitalism and meritocracy but offers no alternative whatsoever. There is a dangerous apology of social revenge ( in the view of the movie, which sides ideologically with the poor, these are justified to kill the rich). It furthers violence, division and polarisation. Repugnant view of the world. Biased, Immoral, Unreal. Pure unadulterated prejudices. Not surprised that Cannes and Hollywood give it prizes. These awards are clearly political. Cinematic Quality has nothing to do with it. All this hype furthered my opinion about the inherent detestability of this very bad movie. Overrated is an understatement. Sick film, sick story. We live in decadent times. It is obvious."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"This is the first and only movie I've felt compelled to write a review for.  Admittedly, I rarely watch foreign language films because of having to read subtitles, but I made a point this year of watching every Oscar-nominated film I could. I had absolutely no idea what to expect going into it, and I think that's what made the film so compelling. Absolutely exceptional acting, beautiful cinematography, moving symbolism and pertinent social commentary. I could never predict what would happen next in the plot, and just when you think it should go one way, it does a 180 and goes a completely unexpected direction.  Go into it knowing as little as possible about it. It's so much better that way. You won't regret it."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Parasites are a social movie whose main theme is a discussion about poverty. In the main role, a family of poor people who get a job in the house of the rich. At first glance, it seems that the name ""Parasites"" obviously expresses the author's opinion about the main characters. But then you realize that the main characters are shown with great love, and the author would not like to call them guilty. But the rich family is not exposed as antagonists, they are naive, kind people, as much the main characters as the poor. It is not possible to call the third family parasites. Then who are the parasites? I would say that the parasites in this film - and this is what makes movies valuable to me-are rather States, social statuses. Poverty, as well as wealth, are parasites, they set boundaries, they deform people, and people are not really to blame, people by their nature do not seek evil, they are only victims.  If we talk about the plot and the overall feeling of the picture - it is dynamic and interesting, the dialogues are cute, the plot is constantly developing and growing, and resembles Kafka, in the sense of growing and growing absurdity. In General, the film is a Comedy, it is easy to watch, through the whole picture there is a light humor and irony, from this the ending becomes surreal - it is even more felt that all the characters are victims.  Also in the film there is an extremely pleasant and easy symbolism. Very interesting is accompanied by the movement of the plot and characters of the symbol of water, which at one point becomes a flow, a symbol of the smell, which becomes smell, the use of characters for foreign words, the idea of ""plan"", which gradually develops one of the characters, the stone that brings wealth and relationship of the hero with him. This gives room for intellectual play and a more complete immersion in the picture and situation.  It is impossible not to say that the film is damn beautiful and flawlessly shot. I would like to say something about dialogues - sometimes they are so vital and interesting that it takes your breath away. I liked the ending very much, apparently the author still comes to the sad conclusion that no matter what, poverty can not be overcome, you can not cross the boundaries that the characters are trying to break.  10 out of 10"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I just watched ""Parasite"" for the first time. It is currently February and I watched the film for the first time around Thanksgiving. I loved it back then and I love it even more now. Definitely is one of my ALL TIME FAVORITE MOVIES. This movies plot is absolutely insane but that is not the important part of the movie. It is really a story about trying to move up in the world and how that's an impossibility. And that even the hope can destroy you. The movie is thrilling, beautifully directed, heart felt, etc.. Also, from a re-watch point of view you pick up many new points of analysis and get to notice how beautifully edited this movie is. I want to write more but that would get into spoilers and you would stop reading. But watching this movie is a NECESSITY."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"This work is one of the greatest films that I have seen ... Indeed, it is a masterpiece in the fullest sense of the word in terms of direction, which was a professional of all professionalism or the method of sequencing events that were easy for the viewer and makes him coordinate with the events without even feeling ... more on that The performance of the actors that was so great that you feel that you are involved with them in the events or rather merge with it ... The bottom line is this movie is creativity creativity creativity"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I'm sure I'm not the only one to see the similarities - which is not meant as a negative comment in any way ... if anything I hope it leads to an Inside no. 9 film - that said - I seem to remember the League of Gentlemen film being a bit crap even though I loved the TV series.  Parasite keeps you interested from start to finish with great comedy, great characters, great twists & turns, great cinematography during the flood sequences and I especially enjoyed seeing the contrast between living standards in South Korea.  So many good things to enjoy like the impression of a North Korean news anchor, dark humour. My favourite character was probably the father but I loved them all for different reasons.  Definitely going to seek out more Asian films now."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"It's one of the greatest films I've ever watched in my life. Truly a masterpiece. It was so captivating and an emotional roller coaster. It's an absolute must see!! It deserved every award it got and I'm so proud to see it win 4 oscars. Truly deserved and more. Bong joon ho created one of the most creative, unique, amazing films I've seen."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,The movie's poster looks like it's going to be a thriller/horror genre but I was wrong. It was more drama and reality. I was not that impressed with the storyline. The actors did a good performance of realness but for me this movie does not really add something new to me knowledge that I would had never thought of. I must say the production was great as South Korea really is known for their Dramas which is similar to this movie. Will definitely recommend people of this movie but for me the x factor is missing and also the ending is a bit odd and not well planned. Thats it for me. Thanks for reading.
기생충,Parasite,2019,1,,Don't believe the hype. This is a crass pretentious movie pretending to be a serious story about class struggle. It's obviously made by luvvies in the Korean film industry clique. The ending proves this theory.
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"To be honest, normally, I do not fancy such type of movies, especially asian movies, this one, well, it nearly kills you. It starts somehow slow, even boring, maybe a touch of comedy, but then, then the second half of it is just a nightmare focusing on society and it's negative aspects. This movie kept me awake for many hours at night and will always remind me of so many things like to be thankful for what you have and how to approach others. Check out yourself. For sure, one of the true oscar winners! Fully deserved!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,The movie is very good and very entertaining you will not feel boring during watch it The ending was little dissapointed and the fate of some character was unfair
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"A timeless Masterpiece, a review wouldn't do this film proper justice, just go watch it. Well deserving of its four oscars in Best Picture, Directing, International Feature Film and Writing (Original Screenplay). Still i am a bit dissapointed that non of the cast was even nominated for acting. All around gripping and mesmerizing preformances & plot."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"In this movie Bong Joon-ho directs like Billy Wilder plus Alfred Hitchcock... the result is just unique. The plot is not only original but contemporary, funny, scary and poetic at the same time. Remarkable."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,Fantastic gtreatest movie. Win the best motion picture award really.
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"This film was incredibly well shot and thought out! It had basically everything to have in a drama thriller film. Its my first Joon-ho Bong film and my god it was perfect! I love drama, I love thriller and crime. It hit the perfect spot for my liking and the story was perfect and emotional throughout! The awards given to this film were well deserved and after watching the film I can see why. I think I have became a fan of Mr. Bong's films and im off to watch his other hits!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"With a light comedy tone and a very insightful vision, Bong Joon Ho begins an agile story about social classes, their differences and paradoxically their similarities, with great sharpness he also analyzes the legitimate aspirations of social promotion... But at what price? From this thesis, many themes and subtopics emerge: simulation, lies, threats, which lead to stronger ones: revenge, hatred. Bong Joon Ho brings such control of his film that he even turns technologies (cellular) into one more protagonist, who will always be present throughout its history. So far so good, but the climax of ""Parasite"" its conclusion and its end depart from its very interesting beginning, the director seems to want to change now the tone of his comedy towards drama and / or terror, only to end up losing control of his narrative with a grotesque denouement. Consequently the film reduces its intensity and interest with which it started, becoming confusing and anticlimactic. ""A case of parasitosis that quickly went viral and spread to Hollywood itself, who began to distribute prizes..."" Casting includes Kang-ho Song, Sun-kyun Lee, Yeo-jeong Jo, Woo-sik Choi, So-dam Park. Sarcastic sequence of the confrontation with the old housekeeper, who uses the cell phone to threaten, as if it were a weapon."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"The Parasite shows Korean house architects that calls 'Banjiha'(lower level house). Because it appears only at Korea, I taught its mood for Korean, but all over the world liked it!."
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"The story was good. Acting is great. It basically shows the reality of rich and poor difference that exists in our society no matter what. My only reason to give it 6 star is with all the hype this movie has, My expectations were way too high and sadly it didn't live upto that."
기생충,Parasite,2019,1,,"Either I am living in an alternate universe - or this movie is being reviewed by paid reviewers in favor of promoting Parasite.  I left the cinema after an hour. I haven't done that in 10 + years. Incredibly boring movie. Overacting pervasive. Story-line pedestrian. Give it a wide birth..don't waste your money , or more importantly your time on this movie."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"From a thriller of Memories of Murder to a monster film of The Host, Bong Joon Ho could transform a family drama as entertaining as never before.  Truly an unexpected, perfect, blend of genres to satirize class division and hypocrisy.  Even the dialogue scenes are not tiresome, but intriguing and often hilarious.  Well done Korean Cinema, proud of you!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"What a movie ! What a story ! Beautiful , inventive, original, at the end you are on heaven..."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I watched Parasite twice at the 36th Annual JFF (Jerusalem Film Festival) and I have to say, the film is still in my head. The genre of the film is absolutely different from other Hollywood's franchises, trust me (Bong Joon-ho was right!).  This review doesn't contain spoilers (although I do recommend to not read this before you watch the film).  ""Parasite"", directed by a an artist himself Bong Joon-ho, is a social satire comedy-tragedy film that, like the film ""Us,"" tells of two families of different status, one of whom lives in the basement apartment and in unemployment condition. Each member of the poor family plans to sneak into a wealthy family's estate until they are exposed to unexpected twists.  The film won the Palme d'Or award at the Cannes Film Festival and the Sydney Film Festival at the Sydney Film Festival, and in fact, it deserved and won these awards (Eat Straw, Pulp Fiction). Why? Now comes the twist.  On the one hand, Bong uses a very creative black comedy, as I will describe below, to improve stories of inequality, economic imbalance, inherent corruption and power abuse that reflect South Korean society's view. And on the other hand, all seven Bong films cover the genres, from science fiction to police proceduralism to the small-town murder mystery, but they all have many things in common. Such as: in the films ""Mother"" and ""Memories of Murder,"" Bong uses his films to reflect the problematic establishment of Korea, South Korea in particular, and the perfect results. As mentioned, this film is ignored by the genre's conventions: it's soft and cruel; Beautiful and hard; Beautiful and tragic and a masterpiece in her classroom investigation.  The screenwriters, Bong Joon-ho and Han Jin Won, use a lot of twisted sleeves in the plot to make the movie more entertaining this year. Each line is delivered smoothly, as if these characters seem to be real people living in this story, with Jung Jaeli's classic score playing tremendously in the background. The cinematography by Hong Kyung-pyo distinguishes itself from a more realistic grainy style in the basement apartment, to a smoother style when focusing on our rich characters. This point of view causes us to look at two very opposing groups of people differently to make it even clearer that they do not belong to the same world. The classroom systems did not look earthy but still perfect before.  Bong makes sure to simplify the lines between the two sides at certain points and cause your sympathy to jump back and forth with hectic consequences. It is a film that focuses on poverty, despair and what we are willing to do to take what needs to be ours. The tension between supreme elegance and underground threat has never been more in your face. Therefore, Bong likes to blur the lines of the genre and he makes sure he hits every step in the stairwell to succeed.  ""Parasite"" is a craft masterclass in which the power of the story lies in the way comedy and drama rub off on each other in the proper way to ignite a bit of thriller that turns into pure horror when despair and hatred meet each other. This is also not a film that built on one plot twist at the end, it's completely different from any Hollywood film that makes viewers angry at the viewer who just finished watching and suspecting him. This film will be remembered in the history books of world cinema, and foreign cinema in particular as one of the most creative films of the year in general. If not, then Hollywood is completely out of control."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"""Parasite"" is an immense masterpiece. A few days ago I started to seriously interest myself in the vision, starting to look at the various trailers then passing to the reviews...but it did not appeal to me at all. Then one evening I decided to see if this film is really a masterpiece as everyone says or if it is just an extremely overrated film. Well, there are no other possibilities, this film is just a masterpiece. This film surprised me a lot! The characters are sensational: very interesting, well characterized, excellently interpreted. There is not one character that I liked much more than the others, but if I have to mention a few, these are Kim and Ki-Jung. The actors are extraordinary, each one left something inside me. The setting is phenomenal, from the first image you understand perfectly the economic and family situation of the Ki-taek family and then also that of the Park family. I really liked the link with the title of the film ""Parasite"", a metaphor about what the Ki-taek family does in the film. I really liked the drastic change of emotions during the film: it goes from fun and tranquility to tension and anxiety with a scene, extraordinary. Bong Joon-ho's direction is fabulous and in fact it deserved the Oscar. Every award won by this film is extremely deserved. I really liked the choice of objects and the settings that always come back during the film. The ending of the film is incredible, I would never have expected such a turn in a film that seemed highly quiet. I have no other arguments to describe more about what this film represents in the cinema. Indescribable.  I can't wait to see it again.  . Rating: 10/10."
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"I wish I could hop in a DeLorean Phone Booth and travel back in time. Not all that long ago, just to a place before Parasite became ubiquitous with greatness. It's my own fault, coming to it late. At first, I didn't get to it because of life, then I avoided it because of the hype, then I felt like I needed to wait till the right moment to properly enjoy it but the hype never quite died down, did it?  Watching this now, I can't say a bad thing about it. It's brilliantly shot, everything tracks and makes sense on the screen. The story is fascinating and feels fresh and different. The acting is all spot on, even managing to make characters that really shouldn't be likable... Likable. The metaphors laid out are relevant and neither feel like they are assaulting you or like you need an advance degree in film theory to understand. It's all good stuff.  So why don't I love this movie? I liked it. I did. But I wanted to come away from it with a sense of awe. I wanted to feel the masterpiece that is Parasite, like the rest of the world seems to have felt it. Instead, I feel like it's good, really good even, but I don't quite get the hype. If I had to put my finger on it, I'd say it's probably because I don't connect with the characters all that much, save for one. Everyone else here felt pretty basic to me.  I absolutely plan to watch this again. I want to uncover what's here, I want to see what everyone else sees in it. As of right now though, definitely haver to put Snowpiercer above this one, in my own personal preference rankings."
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,The wokeness I am referring to is Hollywood. Best picture? Because it's a foreign film written by non white males and no white males are in the movie. This is a nice way to cap off the decade of insane wokeness. That is the only conclusion I can come to as to why this won so many Oscars (which have been a joke ever since Shakespeare in Love beat Saving Private Ryan for best picture).
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"**""Parasite"" (2019) - 10/10 - A Masterpiece of Dark Satire & Suspense**  Bong Joon-ho's *Parasite* is a flawless blend of dark comedy, thriller, and social commentary. The story of two families-one wealthy, one desperate-colliding in shocking ways is both gripping and brutally insightful. Stellar performances, razor-sharp writing, and unforgettable twists make this a modern classic.  **Best for fans of:** Hitchcockian tension, dark humor, and films that haunt you long after the credits roll. **A must-watch.**"
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"So far I've watch Jo Jo Rabbit, Joker, The Irishman, Once Upon A Time In Hollywood, and Parasite. Parasite deserves the win because it's only out of those movies(plus a few I haven't seen yet) but that's grading on a curve. It's not a great film. It's cliche and has some bizarre plot lines that are interjected as a way out of obvious plot holes (plus some cheap entertainment value). Curiously absent from the Oscar nominations was Uncut Gems which I found to be more entertaining and powerful than Parasite and the others(almost passed over watching that one but decided to give it a go because Adam Sandler hasn't been funny in 15 years anyway so let's see him in a drama - he was brilliant)."
기생충,Parasite,2019,1,,"I have been watching (and trying to watch) Korean movies and TV in the past year and my biggest two issues with Korean style movie making are that they overdramatize the mundane and they make the police/authorities hilariously incompetent. Both of which (no surprise) showed up in this film. They spend so much on the emotional part of film making and none on realism.  The ending - any half decent detective would have pieced it all together, including the cellar.  The invitation - why would any sane house-sitter invite a total stranger into the house?  Everything about this movie is frustrating, it's like watching 90s hollywood action flick. All emotions, no realism."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"This film seems like all those I've seen at home without even wanting to watch a movie, it's so good, it catches you.  And I love it.  From the beginning to the end of it, we can see how clever this production is, how smooth, how well intended... I love that it doesn't threaten itself as a cult film by wanting to be a very serious film (even though it is) and leaving space for regular conversations between characters. Not everything in a movie must be relevant to the plot, sometimes we just want a long or short walk in the universe of the film, and that's ok too!  I want to thank the director for it, I love this style."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"A movie demonstrating different classes in society, accompanied with great acting, an original plot and beautiful cinematography, if you want a movie that you can find new things and hidden meanings everytime you rewatch, Parasite is THE movie you want, certainly one of the best movies of last decade and completely deserved all single awards it won."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"It was so unpredictable, such a twist, so off the rails into the stratosphere, it's just - wow. Utterly a roller-coaster.  I never would have expected something like this from a Korean movie - it's just not how they usually feel to me, it's more something like Seth MacFarlane does in his Family Guy or American Dad.  It's serious, meaningful, so alive, and so tragic, so heart-breaking and so terrifying. And in the same time kinda light and funny. It never an overdose of either emotion, it's just enough to enjoy their somewhat sharp sensation. I just usually like those things, and this one is perfectly done, perfectly balanced, spiced and fresh."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Thrillingly played by a flawless ensemble cast who hit every note and harmonic resonance of Bong and co-writer Han Jin-won's multi tonal script, it's a tragicomic masterclass that will get under your skin and eat away at your cinematic soul."
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"The great thing about this movie is that rich people actually do nothing wrong. The husband and wife are loving, the children are gratifying, there is no derailment, there is no cold violence, there is no child abuse, and the driver and the servant are generous. Judging from the movies, they are stupid and have more money. They do not have their own main ideas. They are turned around by the poor, as if to play a role in highlighting the poor."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"Parasite, dark and satirical, reflects society's corruption in class struggle. The films follow a struggling family, the Kims, and their climb to fortune through working for a wealthy family, the Parks. Bong Joon-ho et al.'s fastidious composition of every frame, consistent symbolism, and contrasting color grading leave no doubt as to how Parasite garnered the 2020 Academy Awards for Best Picture, and several other nominations and wins. The film's ending, fresh and unexpected, never felt out of place as the subtleties of carefully placed details throughout the film foreshadow the ending's twist. The gifted stone, speculated to bring wealth, only brought corruption and misfortune; The bright red sauce splashed onto pizza foreshadowed the fatal consequences of the schemes crafted; The line that must never be crossed- except when one character does, all subconsciously produced the perfect atmosphere of the foreboding implication of something terrible to come.  The contrast of the darkness of the Kim's downstairs world to the Park's airy, bright, and naturally lit atmosphere forces the audience to reflect on their interpretation of class. As we watch the endings of each character, we have to wonder if they got what they deserved. How we feel about them forces us to confront our values- to many, this led to the feeling of discomfort and that the film was too 'odd'. The constant artificial lighting and dark grading of the downstairs world remind us of the Kim's goals to worm their way up in search of light. As Joon-ho's morally gray characters climb up the stairs or driveway, they reflect the inherent societal desires for wealth and the strive to achieve it. Joon-ho uses separate upstairs and downstairs worlds to supplement the film's message rather than to become the premise of it. This allows a fresher and freer interpretation of class struggle rather than recycling through past examples of this familiar piece of symbolism for class struggle. The character's journey of climbing up becomes another one of the film's several subtleties."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"The overall movie is good but the storyline is not that much awesome, The ending can be dramatically criticized. The acting of the cast was good but the act driver kin was barely called good. The intimate seen between the owner of the house can be more exaggerated but overall it was okay. The duration of the movie is quite it might be an boring art of entertainment for some low attention span people cuz there are so many underlying shots that is slow but it was important to make the story more charming and beautifully presentable. I have given this movie 7 out 10 cuz I liked the concept of writing but the story could be completed in 1.5 hour. Thank you."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I understand that some people might not want to see this movie because it's entirely in Korean, but if you do decide to watch it I guarantee you that this will be one of the best movies you've ever seen  I'll admit I wasn't expecting much from this movie, I saw movies like 1917, and Joker and up until a couple of days ago I was apart of the those who believed that either one should have one Best Picture. Now I wasn't apart of those who thought Parasite shouldn't have one because it was a foreign film, I always thought that opinion was a little silly, I mean 1917 is literally a British film. And while it's not as foreign as Parasite, it is still foreign.  Anyways I finally got around to watching this movie, and let me tell you. This is legit one of the best movies ever made. It is terrific. Whatever you've thought about this movie get ready for it to wipe all of those of the board. I was enamored with the movie from the second it started.  So, yeah if you can bare having to read the subtitles it's very good 10/10."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Filmmaker Bong Joon Ho once again surprised us with another masterpiece named Parasite. Where powerful social satire meets tragedy. The director did a great job portraying South Korea's current views on society exposing the underprivileged slums of most modern cities and it's citizens living in completely different worlds despite staying in close proximity. You are likely to find it relatable as the themes of this story are not just localized to Korea, but all over the world. Having its fair share of global capitalism and universal materialism, Meritocracy being the biggest trope of this movie.  Now, the best way to enjoy this film is to cluelessly get into it, its charm is to watch it progress and unfold in many satisfying, unexpected ways.  You can definitely see a unique directorial vision as Parasite welcomes the audience into multi-genres and tonal shifts that mix and take its turn after every act. Pure comedy, dark comedy to heavy drama, horror, thriller, mystery, you name it. It is one of the hardest things to pull off but the director converts them smoothly without letting the audience feel indifferent to the transformation. It manages to elicit the full range of responses, making the viewer react with uneasy laughter to unexpected situations that eventually lead to disturbing events full of horror.  Now, who are the real parasites? The poor who attach themselves to the rich or the rich who suck the marrow of the poor?  Satirically, it managed to portray how we may live under the same skies, but have different views regarding life.  -- ""You know what kind of plan never fails? No plan. No plan at all. You know why? Because life cannot be planned.""  Success and fortune are reserved for those who deserve it, those who develop solid plans according to their talents and abilities and who execute those plans through hard work and determination. Anyone can rise to the top, but for those who cannot escape their sad reality will ultimately turn for the worse and thus start to justify their immoral backstabbing, deceit, and callousness for reasoning that can be only explained by growing up poor without support from others.  The characters all have different aspects to them that will be received and viewed differently due to the viewers own biases and world views. This isn't a bad thing as the movies main point is to deliver a provocative social commentary in various metaphors. And the best way to do so is to create morally questionable characters that will resemble at least one familiar person known to you.  ,,Greed is inside each one of us, but the question is, how much are you willing to sacrifice for an idea of life in comfort?'' --- All in all, Parasite is a fantastic case of hard-hitting yet entertaining cinema.  And one of the best movies recently made in Korea."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,It's hard to pinpoint what's so great about this movie. Just watch it.
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I feel bad for people who refuse to watch foreign films purely because they don't want to read subtitles and whatnot because they are really missing out. For the first half of this movie it's great, just a story about a poor family who tries to integrate themselves into the lifestyle of a Rich family. The second half is like really weird though but I enjoyed it. Does it deserve all the praise it gets? Honestly I'd say yes. Like this is one of the best onscreen portrayals of economic inequality and corruption of wealth I've ever seen. The ending is brilliant, but I wouldn't even call it bong joon he's best.10/10."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"I managed to not know much about this before watching. Was genuinely surprised by a few plot twists, and was at the edge of my seat or holding my breath for many moments, with many laughs at the believable absurdity in between. In the end, I felt this was a thought-provoking commentary on the desperation and feelings of being trapped experienced by many in poverty."
기생충,Parasite,2019,4,,"I'm torn on how to rate this. The acting was good, the cinematography was pretty amazing, and I was captivated by the plot, but I just really didn't like the story.  Most of the characters seem like terrible people. At first they were fine, dude was taking a job. All good, he helped his sister get a job by lying. Eh, fine whatever. Then getting other people fired to take their jobs... and then it all ends in murder? I'm not confused by the plot, but rather confused about why people love this so much. Granted, it's probably just not my thing. I tend to not like movies where most of the characters are terrible people and there's basically no redeeming qualities. Classics that people love, ""Gone with The Wind"" and ""Grease"", are two movies I hate. This movie did nothing for me, other than leaving me confused on it's point. If you loved it, that's fine. I'm not trying to hate on this movie, or people who like it, I just don't get the hype.  After watching a video explaining the themes a bit more, I decided to add two more stars to my rating. I understand the themes and why they are important, but this movie isn't for me."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"Bong Joon-ho's ""Parasite"" is a cinematic triumph that seamlessly weaves together elements of satire, suspense, and social commentary. Set in modern-day South Korea, the film follows the impoverished Kim family as they cunningly infiltrate the lives of the wealthy Park family. What begins as a tale of deception and manipulation soon spirals into a gripping exploration of class struggle and the disparity between the haves and have-nots.  The brilliance of ""Parasite"" lies in its ability to keep viewers on the edge of their seats while delivering thought-provoking commentary on societal inequality. Through its captivating characters and meticulously crafted plot twists, the film challenges viewers to confront uncomfortable truths about privilege, greed, and the human condition.  From its stunning cinematography to its stellar performances, ""Parasite"" captivates audiences from start to finish. It's a film that stays with you long after the credits roll, leaving you pondering its implications and eager to revisit its intricacies again and again."
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"It was a really great and funny movie, but really predictable which makes it hard to say if it really is one of the greatest. Of course, it was funny, creative and overall just good. Highly recommend if you're into Mr Bean/Charlie Chaplin comedy"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"This is a film that has been in the news lately as it picked up 4 Oscars including Best Director & Best Picture which is huge for a non english speaking film. I have now had the chance to see the film and this is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees a poor family look to gain an opportunity by gaining jobs in a higher class family and gain the advantages from that.  Main Character Now there are quite a few characters in this film but really Woo-Sik Choi plays the son in the family and he does a great job in the film, you can see he has pretty honest intentions at first but things start to unravel for him and he doesn't quite know what to do. He is likeable but you aren't sure if you should root for him and that creates a multi layered character that keeps you interested throughout.  Supporting Characters Everybody gives a superb performance in the film, I won't go through everybody's names as they are quite long but whether it is the poor family or the rich family everybody is believeable and real in the film. These characters are as mentioned before multi layered and you just aren't exactly sure who exactly to root for. The one actor I will mention is Kang-Ho Song as the Father of the poor family, he is truly brilliant in this film, he probably goes through the most in this film and he is the most interesting person in this film and honestly he should have probably got nominated for the Best Supporting Actor at The Oscars but nonetheless he is great in this film.  Story The first 20 minutes of this film I wasn't exactly sure where this film was going but it is super fascinating watching the dynamics between the two families and seeing the different personalities and motivations which really blurs the line. I don't want to go into the plot too much as I had no idea what this film was about before I watched it so it should be the same for you. Also to put it on top the ending for this movie is so thought provoking and perfect for the film that has been going on.  Script The script even though in Korean is brilliant, this film suprisingly has tons of humour in it, I laughed quite a bit in this film which shows just how well the writing is to make these characters feel multi dimensional. The drama also really works to make you truly care about what is going on and what is happening to the characters that you are watching.  Style First of all lets mention that obviously this film has subtitles, this should not be something to worry about as it is fine and the film is so strong that it doesn't matter. Okay this film has a bit of everything in a stylistic way, it looks great and has bits of comedy, thriller, drama & horror, it is a perfect blend that keeps you on the edge of your seat and excited to see what comes next.  Overall Overall, this is one of the best films I have seen in the last few years, it just has a bit of everything to it and was well worthy of its Best Picture win at the Oscars. If you are put off by foreign films and reading subtitles, don't be as this is a truly special film that has to be seen to truly appreciate just how good it really is.  Rating - 10/10."
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"Beautifully filmed and acted! One family inserts itself into another, and neither will be the same again. And the way they address the socioeconomic disparities through the use of smell is really interesting. I didn't love the ending, but the rest was thoroughly engaging!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"I just re-watched ""Parasite,"" and it's still a perfect movie. It's a total genre-bender, starting as a black comedy about a poor family scamming a rich one, then shifting into a suspenseful thriller, and finally into a heartbreaking drama. The way Bong Joon Ho navigates these tone changes is just incredible. The screenplay is a work of art-every detail, every line of dialogue, feels perfectly placed. The cast is phenomenal, and their performances sell the story's wild twists. What really sticks with me is the film's sharp social commentary. It's an entertaining ride, but it also makes you think deeply about class and inequality. It's a film that works on so many levels.  Is it worth watching? Absolutely, without a doubt. It's a modern classic and a must-see for anyone who loves great cinema."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"So I finally decided to watch this movie today and I am just blown away because I definitely heard about it when it first came out and all the awards and all the other movies it topped and granted I watched it with a baby and a toddler so it was a lot of pausing and definitely gonna rewatch it, but this movie was amazing from beginning, middle, and end. It was truly worthy of everything at one I am beyond surprised like I did not know what I was in Stored for I never read anything about it but I definitely wanted to see it and today was the day and I'm so glad I did like I would love to watch this with my husband and just sit back and enjoy it like this was hands-down, one of the best films. I've watched in a very long while and funny thing is, it was recommended when I was looking at what was like gone girl and I enjoyed that movie even though it pissed me off, but it was a great plot too, but this one was definitely one you wanna watch."
기생충,Parasite,2019,5,,"Despite its social commentary and clever cinematography, this movie is still kinda cliche, with predictable and forced plots, with cringeworthy acting here and there.  BTW, Bong Joon Ho = Ki Woo, Hollywood = Park family."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Who are the parasites? This is the question going through your mind throughout the film. That's why this film is so good. The rich family living their lives without a care in the world. The poor family desperate to survive. Are the rich family kind, selfish or both? What about the poor family? Who are the parasites? Both families? When the rain comes and floods the ""poor people"", the rich family can only say how pleased they are to have the rain. But is it because they are selfish or are they blissfully unaware? This is story of how people view the world after experiencing two different lives. It's brilliant, full of questions and thoughts."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Parasite (2019) is a masterpiece at it´s finest. There is clearly no surprise that it won 4 Academy Awards.  My favorite part of the film was 100% the cinemaphotography, this movie is art, and that's thanks to the cinemaphotography. Every angle isn´t lazy. It´s well made and the director Bong Joon Ho took every chance possible to put his vision on the big screen.  Another amazing thing is the acting. The actors put the best performance possible. From dramatic scenes, to intense scenes and to horror scenes.  Now some people might not like the ending, but it had me amazed. It shows also how unpredictable this film is.  It also shows how everyone isn´t who they say they are. Even if its just small things.  This film is amazing and if you haven´t seen it, then I highly recommend it. (unless you cant handle violence) if not, then watch it."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"In Bong Joon-Ho's game-changing social critique, the rich and the wretched descends into capitalist hell in sardonic, comical, and horribly grounded fashion.  Notions of class hierarchy have been told and retold by cinema over the decades. Predominately attached to the socioeconomic spectrum, stratification has always stirred up a profound impact on societies' minds when it comes from caustic satires or reactive commentaries. Ranging from Michael Bay's greedy paradox ""Pain & Glory"" to Alfonso Cuaron's autobiographical black-and-white gem, from Sean Baker's thoughtful portrait of post-financial crisis in ""The Florida Project"" to Paul Feig's Oscar-nominated powerhouse ""Bridesmaids"", capitalist prototypes and social dynamics have come and gone in all sorts of unimaginable shapes to bring out the inner demons of human survival.  In times of cholera and uncertainty, Bong Joon-Ho's latest and buzziest masterpiece comes like a head-turning accomplishment, a surgically accurate class fable, a truly gripping multi-genre piece of entertainment, and a reinvigorating storytelling-rich decade-new awake. Ever since its Palme d'Or win, ""Parasite"" has been ground-breaking new history, not only by becoming the very first non-English language, non-epic-length period drama nabbing the Best Picture award at the 2020 Oscars ceremony- golden ticket Cuaron's ""Roma"" lost to polarizing, preachy ""Green Book"" back in 2019 -but by giving new life into movie-going experience in an aging era of convoluted streaming-service battles and rowdy franchise-building tentpoles.  In a way, ""Parasite"" feels like the ""Inception"" of this new century. Back in 2010, Christopher Nolan's towering 160-million Russian doll odyssey opened several doors industry-wise, putting the absolute, always-coveted formula into one single movie: crushing box office incomes, cerebral, wholly original storytelling, and, above else, priceless craftsmanship power. However, Nolan did not treasure any social-resounding message as sharply as Bong Joon-Ho did overseas. ""Parasite"", on the other hand, is a small-budgeted, South-Korean thinking piece that, even while managing different procedures- it turned out to be more profitable than Nolan's pic -comes to the very same conclusion: great filmmaking is the key. Social-headed slices of art would never be about big budgets and small films like ""Get Out"" and ""The Invisible Man"" are proving that studios, either big or small, may still conquer audiences with entertaining, on-point storytelling.  Script-wise, ""Parasite"" is an utter knockout. At first glance, the most outstanding, praised features the film exposes now and again are its turns and twists, the comings and goings of a story where everything mutes into something unexpected. These ""think-again"" premium plot devices are the main pulling force for mainstream audiences, even though they are not the most powerful assets Joon-Ho has to offer. The truly one-of-a-kind centerpieces are: proceedings and composition.  Take for instance the 5-minute towering montage at the end of the first act, where black humor, cadence and rhythm are the beating heart of the sequence. It builds and places anticipation at the highest level by using endless narrative tricks to convey the emotions and reactions the film intends to spring up, blurring the line between good and bad, between wealth and the poverty, between sarcasm and irony.  The film succeeds at it, mainly, from hugely magnetic characters. When first we met the Kim family, they leave their banjiha's windows wide-open in order to get free extermination. They are poor, unemployed and Wi-Fi-needed. The film develops them one by one in a highly audience-catching way, picturing them as both victims and victimizers as the film evolves. Later on, the Park family steps in. They are wealthy, intellectual, picture-perfect individuals. However, unlike the Kim family, the Parks are not portrayed as villains until the masterfully executed final sequence, where each missing piece fits in. For most of its running time, they are naïve, nice elite people who do not want to get sick by their long-time loyal housekeeper. And that feeling of correspondence the film gets from its audience, regardless of origin, race or social status, comes from a core aspect: empathy. We care about them, we are invested in their tragedies, we are as worried and shocked as the characters themselves. Empathy is paramount for wining audiences over, without it, most of the film's purposes would be directly trashed out, and the South-Korean director knows it better than anyone; if not, just take a look at any of his previous works.  Every one of the characters succeeds at becoming storytelling backbones because of the amazing ensemble cast, which- by the way -became the very first foreign Ensemble Winner at SAG Awards, making, one more time, movie history. Park So-dam, Lee Sun-kyun, Choi Woo-shik, Cho Yeo-jeong, and Song Kang-ho deliver award-worthy performances, endowing to the story tangible, three-dimensional characters that, in incompetent hands, would come out as hollow caricatures.  Bong Joon-Ho's pictures are described as many things at once: black comedies, social commentaries, genre-crossing post-apocalyptic adventures. Owning every inch of them, ""Parasite"" spices the mix up with deeper, timely metaphors- make no mistake, peaches and basements are not going to be the same; - however, the film owes it to two crucial aspects: visual language and edition. Camera movements, blocking and visual composition are masterfully managed by the director and his crew. It could have been a silent film, and still it would speak volumes. Cinematographer Hong Kyung-pyo executes his vision with perverse precision and voyeuristic delight, grabbing class divide by the throat. What could have ended up as a mere style exercise between the shady lighting from the semi-basement and the luxury LED lighting of the main mansion, it is now the perfect visual cocktail: sophistication and softness, luxury and poverty, ups and downs, dark and light, hungry beasts in empty spaces.  ""Okja"" composer Jaeil Jung plays an important role as well, shaping the mood and complementing the atmosphere, endowing the film with rich, elegant, horror-like sound scales, getting a heart-stopping, small yet often disturbing soundtrack by adding up layer after layer of complex composed sounds.  ""Gisaengchung"" by Bong Joon-Ho is the crowning achievement of the decade. Many critics have healed it as ""the picture of the year"" and, even if it is tout à fait true, ""Parasite"" transcends the boundaries of society-headed, industry-transforming films; say Jordan Peele's ambitious allegory ""Us"" reimagined through the lens and voices of Shakespeare, Hitchcock and Kim Ki-young, and still you are nowhere near to it. Many talented, socially-aware filmmakers and their equally committed crews have paved the way through the years; now Bong Joon-Ho, in total command of his craft, has made it: ""Parasite"" is a groundbreaking work of art."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"Parasite is a cinematic marvel that goes beyond mere storytelling to deliver a deeply resonating commentary on the class disparities that pervade modern society. Directed by the brilliantly inventive Bong Joon Ho, the film effectively intertwines elements of drama, comedy, and thriller to create an experience that lingers long after the screen goes dark.  The narrative centers on two contrasting families and, through them, explores the complex dynamics of wealth, poverty, and human tendency. It's a masterly crafted web of intrigue that keeps the viewer engrossed and constantly on edge. The screenplay is astoundingly unpredictable and the sharp, crisp dialogue effectively builds tension while maintaining its dark humor.  The cast delivers stellar performances that bring their layered characters to life. Each actor stands out, portraying their varied characters with precision, be it the cunning yet charismatic poor family or the oblivious yet complicated wealthy family. The somber, atmospheric cinematography coupled with the haunting score creates an increasingly uneasy ambiance that height."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"No one is ""evil"". Then how come the bad things happen?  This cinema does not answer, but masterfully poses all the questions that should be asked. Interestingly enough, just like the characters do in the movie, Bong Joon Ho does not allow the audience a moment to think about the grand theme of the movie until the very end: What went wrong?  It's funny, original, thrilling, and universal. It's a movie to watch thoughtlessly with a can of beer. It's a movie you could sit down and study the metaphors for hours.  Parasite suggests a new paradigm for understanding our society, and most importantly, the people inside it."
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,The one thing I got from this movie is that Bong Joon-ho must really hate rich people. This is even more obvious when you consider that his other notable film is basically about the same thing. Rich vs poor. This is a bit odd considering he has a net worth of 30 million dollars.  This movie is about a poor family that lies and weasels their way into the service of a rich family. In doing so they not only screw over several people but also murder a few of them in the process. And yet at the end of the film we're supposed to feel that all of this is somehow justified.  Or maybe we're not supposed to feel that it's justified because I sure didn't.  Not really sure why it got so much praise. Could be because we are living in a time when the majority of movies being made are superheros or reboots. Thats basically the only thing this movie has going for it. It was entertaining and well made but I didn't like the ending at all.
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,PARASITE is a true psychological thriller with a ruthless ending that is a must watch for anyone who is a fan of thought provoking films. I watched this because Bong Joon Ho who wrote SNOWPIERCER also wrote and directed PARASITE.
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"This film has one of the best set ups in recent memory. The stealthy way in which these two families begin to mingle is really extraordinary.  However, there is a turning point in the film in which the entire tone of the film charges. It become very dark and gruesome almost to a comical extreme. I'd be very interested to know if there has been external pressure on the director to push the film in a different direction."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,I've only viewed this film once and everything about it was beautiful! From the addictive plot to the gorgeous cinematography Bong Joon Ho has crafted a modern masterpiece that I will be revisiting repeatedly.
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"When i see the poster at first time, i think this movie would be gore horror movie. Throughout the film, I always felt anxious, like something jumpscare would come, but it wouldn't.  I just said this movie has a good ambiece, nice cinematography, and social issues contained in it. Unpredictable ending i thought. Very well,, Nice Concept."
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"Parasite is a movie that has been recognized and given really good reviews, anyways to me it wasn't the best movie ever. This movie was different in the sense that it played with your mind having a story unpredictable. Parasite is also a reflect of society, our worst fear is ourselves and the system we have constructed. We are always trying to get more and more and sometimes we aren't able to see the risks until you loose it all. That's why I liked all the outcome that reflects what our reality is, anyways the result of all the problems was something not really convincing to me. The possibilities to get to that end are one in one million, so I think even a better ending would be too keep this real idea that things not always end up as we want. The movie in general was really well made, the way Bong Joon Ho thought about every scene and detail is surprising."
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"This drama is tense with suspense and drama. It has some twists and turns and at times, it's dark and creepy. At other times, it's funny. It could have been edited down a good 20 minutes as it dragged in some places (esp. The setup) but overall, very good!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"Parasite is one of those movies that you start watching thinking it's just a drama, but then it slowly turns into something way deeper and darker. Directed by Bong Joon-ho, the film shows two families-the super rich Parks and the poor but clever Kims. At first it's kinda funny how the poor family slowly scams their way into the rich household. But as it goes on, things get way more intense and messed up.  What really hits is how the movie shows the difference between rich and poor, not just with money, but how they live, how they think, and even how they smell (if you've seen it, you know). It's clever how the film mixes comedy, thriller, and horror without it feeling forced. There's this slow burn tension that builds and then suddenly, boom-it all explodes in the last part.  Visually, it's beautiful. Every shot means something. The way they use stairs, rain, the house-nothing's random. The acting is great too. All the characters feel real, not like ""good guys vs bad guys,"" just people trying to survive.  Why 8/10 for me? Honestly, the middle part felt a bit slow for me personally. Also, it's super symbolic, which is cool, but maybe a bit too much at times? Still, a unique movie for sure, and worth watching if you like films that make you think after it ends."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Que filme perfeito, cenas incriveis, roteiro peculiar, amo tudo. História é genial, muito diferente de tudo que ja vi. Que filme perfeito, cenas incriveis, roteiro peculiar, amo tudo. História é genial, muito diferente de tudo que ja vi."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"It was good but for one time only, I dont understand why it got Oscar, Overrated in one word."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,In my view it is neither too good nor too bad But somwhere in middle
기생충,Parasite,2019,5,,What a shame Parasite won the Oscars instead of 1917. I was expected a masterpiece and felt really disappointed. It is like watching 2 different movies. Second half too surrealistic for my taste
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"Saw it in cinema twice. Have nothing bad to say about it. I knew Bong-Joon Ho from Okja, which was a decent movie but not very special. So when it came out at a film festival I decided to go see it and I wasn't disappointed."
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"I did enjoy this film, but it didn't strike me as a worthy Oscar winner."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,Genre defying. There is so much happening in this movie - just when you think you have figured it out it shows you something different. It leaves you wondering - who really is the Parasite?
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"Hi everyone I didn't know anything about the story of the movie, the actors, and the awards that this movie won before watching the movie, and I was interested in seeing it only because of the relatively good ratings given by the viewers.  When I saw the movie, I was really involved and I liked the acting of the actors and the narration of the movie  It is rare that you really enjoy and admire a movie after watching it  After watching the movie, I came to the imdb website and did a small review about this movie, and when I saw that it won four Oscars and won and was nominated in dozens of other festivals, it became even more admirable.  I don't want to talk about the details of the story, firstly because it has already been discussed by others, and secondly, you will get the pleasure of seeing it for the first time.  It was very heartwarming and exciting for me."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"The latest film for Snowpiercer director Bong Joon-ho, Parasite, might very well be his best film to date. Parasite is a thought-provoking film that's part dark comedy, part family drama and part thriller. It's not really a singular genre film, but all these elements complement each other to deliver a surprisingly intense and shocking cinematic experience.  Meet the Kim family, a down-on-their-luck, destitute family of four. Living in an impoverished basement in a South Korean slum, they are forced to glum off of other people's WiFi networks and take menial side jobs folding pizza boxes to bring in a pittance of money. The family's eldest son, Ki-woo (Choi), failed to make it into university, but what he lacks in book smarts, he makes up for in street smarts. He's a natural con artist with the gift of gab. An opportunity soon falls into Ki-woo's lap in the form of a job recommendation. His best friend, Min (Park Seo-joon), is traveling abroad and wants Ki-woo to take over tutoring one of his well-to-do teen students, Park Da-hye (Jung). Min-Hyuk has a romantic interest in the high-school sophomore Da-Hye and wants Ki-woo to watch over her and keep away potential suitors while he's abroad. Min-Hyuk's master plan is to start dating Da-hye when she enters university.  Min-Hyuk's trust in a scam artist like Ki-woo is probably the biggest mistake of his life. With the help of his sister Ki-jung's (Park So-dam) exceptional forgery skills, Ki-woo is easily able to maneuver himself into the rich, well-to-do Park household as the new English tutor for Da-hye. Da-hye's mother, Mrs. Park (Jo Yeo-jeong), is a flighty, snooty simp. She makes for an easy mark for the Kim family to assert themselves into the lives of the Park homestead.  After Ki-woo hatches a master plan, he's able to manipulate Ki-jung into the Park home as the art tutor for the Park's youngest child, Da-song (Jung Hyun-joon). Next up, the kids trick the Park family patriarch, (Lee Sun-kyun), to fire his driver and hire their dad Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho). After that, it's the family housekeeper, Moon-gwang (Lee Jeong-eun), who gets ousted and replaced by the Kim kids' mother, Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin). However, Ki-woo's carefully layered plan is nothing more than a house of cards, and a dark secret within the Park household threatens to shatter the Kim's ticket to money and luxury.  Parasite is a brilliantly shot movie. It's very much a product of its country of origin. As a result, its style is both unique and refreshing when compared to Hollywood films. It's darkly comedic, but it's not exactly an irreverent comedy. At other times, the film is darkly tragic and surprisingly poignant.  The lengths to which the Kim family goes to con and manipulate the Park family are both shocking, and at times, borderline detestable. The one thing that keeps the Kim family from being outright unlikable is their true familial bond. The Kim family is comprised of down-and-out scoundrels, and yet, they still love, respect and appreciate each other. Meanwhile, the white-collar Park family members are self-absorbed, obsessed with their status, image and wealth, and they appear to lack genuine love for one another. If anything, it appears that their wealth and status have made them soft and gullible. The Parks look down at others of a lower social standing. It's evident that while material wealth might bring certain comforts and convenience, it doesn't bring true love or happiness.  This is a remarkable film about the rich vs. The poor and the dynamics therein. While the Parks are generally the protagonists of the story, they are not good people. One imagines if Ki-woo, who comes off as quite brilliant, would likely be better served investing his talents into more legitimate pursuits. His sister, Ki-jung, is equally brilliant and a gifted graphic artist. It's bizarre that these two couldn't apply themselves in school or make it into university. Perhaps that's either a flaw in the storytelling or commentary on the South Korean academic system.  The performances of the main cast are impeccable. Song Kang-ho, as Kim Ki-taek, really steals the show with some surprisingly dramatic and bittersweet moments. While Ki-woo is the basic protagonist of Parasite, Ki-taek is the heart and soul of the movie. The second and third acts feature plot twists that are both surprising and shockingly satisfying. They are twists the audience will not see coming, but they make complete and total sense. Those are the best kind of cinematic ""gotcha"" moments.  Bong Joon-ho and cinematographer Hong Kyung-pyo construct some beautiful imagery. The film is wonderfully shot. The shots are very straightforward, crisp and clear, yet contain all sorts of compelling imagery. The third act also features some quick, surprising, shocking bits of violence and gore that are rather Tarantino-esque. Parasite pulls no punches in terms of its visuals and narratives.  While many are throwing around the word ""masterpiece"" for this film, it might be premature to call it that. Bong Joon-ho has created something with Parasite that's darkly humorous, compelling, dramatic, poignant and bittersweet all at the same time. Parasite is a true cinematic experience that will leave the audience with a lot to chew on during the ride home."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"""Parasite"" is truly a modern masterpiece. For those who don't know, the film released in 2019 to immediate acclaim, winning several awards, and for good reason. The plot follows a poor family and a rich family in Korea. The poor family live underground in a tiny apartment sized home, with little food and luxuries. On the other hand, the richer family lives in a beautiful, futuristic home that looks like something out of a Stanley Kubrick film like ""A Clockwork Orange"" due to its intriguing architecture and design. Anyway, the son in the poor family receives a request from a friend to work at the rich family home. He agrees, and as the story goes on, the poor family forges a plan to purposely eliminate and fire every other worker at the house to be the exclusive workers. Their plan works, in a wacky and comical way. However, it becomes more of a thriller and even horror once the house's basement is revealed to have a man hiding within, the husband of one of the previous workers. It begins to go downhill, and that's when the film peaks and became one of my all time favorites.  Overall, it is a must watch for any movie fan or student! 10/10."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"I had high expectations given the raving reviews here. But I have to say, I was disappointed. Fair enough, it is a decent movie with an original plot, but certainly not one of the best films of all time. Not by a long shot."
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"The series is all about a family showing through the differences in between the classes in the society too, a great series to binge watch too. The series is always gripping the story line and keeps the watcher entertained as well as on the edge to whats going to happen next in the series.  The series is a good walkthrough the differences in the state of the life in our society depending upon the finically or physically. The series as all the pov and everything for all the characters in the series so the audience gets the mindset and the vision for all the character's in it to understand there situation from there view."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"This movie feels so-so, far from boasting so good, or I give too great expectations, the result is too big, the plot is too ordinary, and many people hold this film to the altar"
기생충,Parasite,2019,5,,"I see people really raving over the film and the awards it won, so I was keen to see it, sounded great. And it was great until about two thirds through when the ending kicks in.  The ending was just so-so, seemed to build up to a crescendo and then the plot let the actors down."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"One of the best movies in recent years! Quirky,original and visually stunning. It keeps you on the edge of your seat with constant plot changing.All in a very subtle way. Finally a worthy winner! It will stay with you for days and most importantly ....it will make you forget La La Land."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"This is one of the best movies I've ever seen in my entire life. Inventive, great acting, amazing production value, unique story, social commentary is on point, and amazing surprises.  Cinematography is incredible the colors, the shots, the angles, the framing, it is perfect.  The Acting was believable, funny, surprising, and all around great for all of the characters.  But what shines is the story. Usually when I want to Film, I know what's going to happen, I never knew in this instance. It is full of surprises that should seem too far-fetched, but they aren't. I will not spoil it for you, you just need to experience it for yourself."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"There will be movies after parasite and before parasite. There are not enough words for me to describe a movie like this, and i'm not gonna even try. it's a masterpiece comes in once in every generation."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"The movie is simple in the fact that people like to move up the ladder. Seems removed from our lives, yet things start spiralling out of control, their lives seem not so different from our own daily lives. After some reflection, relatable. Who are the parasites in this society? Is it us? Or them? Or aren't we all living our lives in a cacoon, may it be a luxurious mansio or a rundown flat. We are no better those next to us, and they to us."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"The movie is pretty engaging and great performances by the actors, but all the drama before the oscars etc and hyesteria around this film was definitely unnecessary!  You won't be disappointed watching it. Again, highly overrated."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"No plan is the (best) plan. No position is final. Every life is there to improvise, when the chance is. No fixed values, don't fool yourself. No fixed position (though, society place their limits - or gives opportunities) - it all can change unexpectedly at any given moment. No main roles - each life is a role in itself. So - what's the value? Well, whatever conservative it may sound (especially for a motion-picture like this one) - family values. That's your opportunities, your backup - add some lottery and improvisation - life depicted. Lot of points to the story told (and how), and to actors' play. Lots of points to all the different prospectives - as you see the unrolling event from all the eyes of all the engaged persons (it is a value that many of today RPG have - you can play as any of persons involved - and see from their point of view - and feel their values). I wouldn't call it a drama, neither a ""social comedy"" though. It isn't a detective story either. It's a very talented director's work, play-writer's as well (ah, he's the same one...). It's an amazing cast. And it's more than fairly valued/rewarded - with the ""golden palm"" and a lot of ""oscars"" (despite critics' grumble - what so many ""oscars"" given for...). That one surely goes into a world cinematic library - to be a modern classic."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"The story was really good and enjoyable but, it was kinda a let down knowing how much people hyped this movie. It won so many awards but why. It was not that shocking at all. But the best part about it was the acting and cinematography.  If you want to watch a really crazy mind blowing movie you should watch Old Boy. It's another Korean film that deserved more praise than this movie."

기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"Yes, I know it's not the same-the characters don't impersonate anyone-but there is that gradual occupation of the house, of its wealth, etc. The film reaches a certain depth of anguish where it holds the tension before starting to lift and fluctuate again. It really could have been much more claustrophobic and disturbing, hence the title I've given it.  The story is nothing new, but I do think it's constructed in an elegant, solid way, with attention to subtleties-for example, the theme of smells. I find it quite remarkable how something that is a blessing for some can be a catastrophe for others, like the rain.  I appreciated how there was a sense of justice in seeing suffering on both sides, albeit in different forms. I didn't like how the ending was resolved; there's something unresolved and uncomfortable left hanging in the air. Perhaps that's the director's intention.  Well-made, well-acted, with costumes and dialogue quite competently handled, and a collision of two very different worlds-as the title suggests. The ending felt somewhat simplistic."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,This movie is amazing! One of the best films I have ever seen. Parasite definitely deserved to win Best Picture despite no matter how much a certain somebody disagrees. Don't let subtitles keep you from experiencing this wonderful piece of movie art!
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"I enjoyed this movie. It had some surprises in it, and I really couldn't predict where it was going to end up. It was extremely well made and well written, and the performers all did a great job.

기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I was really sceptical about ""Parasite"" in a way because of the hype, but I also had fate in the movie being good because Bong Joon-ho have delivered knock out after knockout. (Okja, Snowpiercer) Also I really like Song Kang Ho previous works. Most notably ""The Taxi Driver"", which left me crying my eyes out on a 8h flight. Do not recommend.  Anyways, Parasite is a masterpiece. Every time I thought I'd figured the plot out there was a twist. Everyone also kept going on about the ending and I was like, meh. Well, they were right about the ending.  Can't describe this movie. The plot is as indescribable as Fight Club, Get Out or Us.  Go watch it."

기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"This movie is... memorable. I went into it not knowing what to expect at all, which is how I'd recommend others watch it as well. I would rate the movie an 8, but I find it hard to justify why. If I imagine the exact same story being played out in an American setting, it would get a 4 from me at most. So I settled on a 6... The storyline is absolutely rediculous, but you can't help but to keep watching. Interestingly, the movie doesn't convince you to root for the main characters. That might be it's biggest strength. This movie is definitely worth the watch, if only so that you can form your own opinion."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Gisaengchung is an amazing film with a wonderful and strong script, amazing acting, beautiful cinematography and a great production design. The film is a comedy, a thriller and a strong drama. Parasites in two worlds, poor ones and rich ones. Rich being parasites to poor people, exploiting them and poor people getting better things from the rich using some tricks. This movie is mainly about poor people being parasites, with a strong direction. A wonderful film, a masterpiece!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,5,,"I watched the film without any knowledge of anyone's critic or rating. I got into the interesting plot of the beginning with much more curiosity for the direction it could drive me to. However, I was disapointed when blood began to flow everywhere unnecessarily, without serving any purpose. I am not a Tarantino's fan, that's for sure. In the end I could not realize if class struggle or social inequality aspects of our society should be told on screen in such a confusing way. Or was it simply a flat thriller? I did not quite get it. Surely overrated though."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Bong Joon-ho's ""Gisaengchung"" (""Parasite"" in English) became the first foreign-language movie to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards. And it was a deserved win. Like ""Joker"", it employs some unusual methods to address class conflict in modern society. To crown everything, it takes a subtly comedic approach to the topic!  A lot of people had never heard of Bong before this movie. I've known about him ever since I saw ""The Host"". I've seen a couple of other Korean movies in addition to his movies. If this movie gets people interested in Korean cinema, then all the better; some great movies come from there. But in the meantime, this movie probably says more about modern society than just about any other movie from last year. Definitely see it."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"This movie was freaking amazing!! On top of the genius commentary on class in developed countries and all the nuances it uses in that story, it is absolutely gorgeous. Every shot is piece of art, the editing and visuals are gorgeous and powerful in their symbolism. Plus the score is so so beautiful and emotional, you feel the tension in every moment. The pacing is also fantastic, it leans in slowly, exactly how you want a thriller to do. By the time you've reached the end of it you feel ""how did I get here"" but at the same time it makes total sense how you got there. The desperation portrayed by the actor's performances is also so genuine. Their acting capabilities are so overlooked too when you factor in all the fantastic elements of this movie. It more than meets the mark in every aspect. I would recommend it to almost anyone."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I don't even know what to say. In fact, I don't even want to say anything about this movie. Just go see it if you haven't. You'll be glad you did."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"My dad is someone that doesn't even watch foreign films that require subtitles and he thought it was great. If thay doesn't cry out how great this film is then I don't know what.  This screenplay is one of the best in a long time, incorporating elements that fit together like a puzzle, the characters are all deep and compelling, the score will be stuck in my head for a long time, and the story is one to go in without knowing anything. Bong Joon Ho is deserving of his Oscar wins and I hope this will introduce more Americans to South Korean films that are as good as Parasite."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Oscars, golden globe.. I had to see why. Now I know. my english is not good enough to say anything smart :) all I can say is wow.."
기생충,Parasite,2019,,,"This film is Brilliant! I loved it. The portrayal of class struggles, the twists and the tense moments...amazing. This film was brilliantly executed! It is a masterpiece. If you havent seen it yet, dont wait."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"The movie and all the comedy elements in it are good, but the plot points are just too weird and too over the top.  7 is okay and logical but 8 or more is too much for this. Seriously guys."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"This is a brilliant movie, just watch it without reading too many reviews, you won't regret it."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"I watched Parasite yesterday before the Oscars, and was truly disappointed. The ending just turned what could've been a great movie into a good one. So I was shocked for the all the love that it received from the Academy! I truly believe there were so many better international films that deserved best script/director/picture awards such as Separation by Asghar Farahadi !!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,1,,"Wth??!! It's absolutely bad, the movie is boring, pure fantasy, like science fiction movie, I think it's like a someone smoke a big one and make and boring, fanciful and idealistic movie..."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"It works on so many levels it means so many things to different people you can see it in the reviews that are across youtube, rottentomatoes, etc.. Everyone has something different that sticks out for them and yet this film blends it so well.  I know for a fact that this movie will be considered up there with The Godfather and Pulp Fiction in due time. It only just won Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Foreign Film Oscars and people will slowly start studying it more and more. When you see the best analysis channels like Nerdwriter write glowing essays on Parasite you know its hit its mark very deeply.  Outward differences aside, this movie IMO is very similar to the ""What Could Go Wrong?"" Genre like in No Country for Old Men, A Simple Plan, but its also such a study and understanding in different socio-economic class, poor vs rich, and its fourth act is very Hitchcock.. This movie will stick with you and I am just glad that I was alive to see this movie. That's how good it is."
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"With one of the most staggering turns in movie history, the stakes in what was already an extremely tense moment rose to an unprecedented level. The characters walk on such a fine line when trying to keep the other family fooled by their act that the film contains some of the most tense moments I have ever seen. The desperation and the lengths at which they go to left me in awe and made me question if their aim was still, if ever, worth it.  With a finely crafted script, true emotion, and some beautifully positioned shots, this film is unforgiving and left me completely emptied and speechless in what was one of the most affecting movies I have seen. Parasite will stick with me for a long time."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,Will stay with you long after you leave the theater. Worthy of ever award and accolade that comes its way.
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"Everyone says the film is about social class but I do not agree. That is just the setting. Like many Korean film makers the audience has no clue where the film is going. That is something I really appreciate. In the end it is not realistic, but entertaining.  Does the film have a deeper message? Yes, but it is for discussion. The poorer family seems quite able, but somehow unable to work. Why? Maybe because they have psycho problems (e.g. father controlling his violence). And maybe that is why many able-looking people are poor. The richer family is very nice. How often are rich people taken in like that? Well quite often I would say if the acting is right."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I thought that it is kind of black joke things. Satirizing the polarization, poverty or bad condition of society is the things that i had imagined befrore i saw the movie. Did you also expect that? My answer is it'll never happen.  After the movie i feel like someone punch my head, and then i feel so bad at something that ican't explain what exactly it is.  Highly recommeded to see it."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Best Picture well deserved. Thank you Bong, very cool."
기생충,Parasite,2019,,,"The score and the overall tone of the movie is so excellently filmed, each scene draws you in and you're not sure quite what will happen next."
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"Parasite 6/10... very well made movie but is it the first Korean movie the academy have seen??! The oscars throwing best international movie, best director, best screenplay and best motion picture at this movie just goes to prove my theory that the Academy are so out of touch and so desperately want to appear ""woke"" and this action by them is just an insult to all the great Korean movies that have come before this and all the other great movies released in the last year. For me this was an above average South Korean movie but everyone latched onto it as some kind of miracle of modern cinema... Meh academy, meh!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,Every frame of this movie is a film diploma itself .. Surely one of the best movies in last 10 years
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"Pleased for South Korean cinema it got the Oscar nod, but personally for South Korean cinema I much preferred The Handmaiden. As a film from thus year's contenders, I liked 1917 the most"
기생충,Parasite,2019,1,,"I am flabbergasted, I went expecting so much from an Oscar winner, and my cousin has relocated to Korea and loves the country, and was left speechless. The plot is tired, the characters unlikely and I was just bored. Half the cinema had their phones out. In fact a 5 minute trip to the toilet felt like blessed relief from the tedium. I will never get that evening back. Shockingly bad."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,This is the first time i have ever seen such a good Asia film like that! You will not regret if you pay some money to see that
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,Very suspense and dark humour are glamorously seen. Acting are superb. What a masterpiece. Well deserved Oscar 👍
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I've never seen a movie do all the things that Parasite does and manage to do them so well. It's a comedy, thriller, horror, and heist film rolled into one, meticulously directed and beautifully edited. It remains entertaining while dealing with heavy topics on the nature of class and wealth. While the movie takes some unexpected turns in tone, it never feels disjointed. Most importantly, Bong Joon-Ho has a way of relaying his social criticism in a nuanced manner, so that the theme of wealth disparity doesn't devolve simply into the poor vs. the wealthy narrative we see often in these types of dramas. Rather, he layers multiple shades of gray into the morality of characters, giving them humanity and therefore a stronger verisimilitude to real people in current society. It makes the movie's appeal universal.  After watching the movie I was floored. It was the only thing I could think about for hours afterwards. Even now I keep discovering another layer of interpretation behind a dialogue or scene. And there is a lot to engage with when the film direction is so detailed. Each shot and each line of dialogue is a result of careful storyboarding and writing. Even the background details such as the brick walls and the litter by the Kims' basement are painstakingly styled and arranged by the set designers. And the result, at least in my summation, is a near perfect execution of a great film."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"This movie is pure art. The subtle theme becomes entangled with the characters' lives and relationships. Must watch. i give 9/10 because this movie made me sad , its a education for us not an entertainment . as education i would give 10/10 as an Entertainment 9/10 for me . anyway its a must watch for everyone ."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"With ""Parasite"" Bong Joon Ho goes for another exercise of social commentary, not unlike his praised ""The Host"" (2006) - for those who cared for a monster movie dealing with social issues. It wasn't for everyone, though. Both films are 'so metaphorical' as ""Parasite"" protagonist Kim Ki-woo likes to put it. But different strokes for different people, no? Certainly, the metaphors aren't on vacation this time around, it's just that they learned to profess some subtlety. As back then, Bong pulls out all the stops in ""Parasite,"" and while the former picture's literally Godzillish rendition matching its ambitions makes it borderline, the new approach is hard to skip. It takes on the shape of a pitch-dark comedy with coarse edges when it counts. One might as well let one's self get immersed in it, enjoy the ride and laugh along, relish its twists and turns before receiving a blow from left field. ""Parasite"" comes across as less pretentious, settles on the more down-to-earth (pun intended) side of things; it plants its seed with a much smaller dose of horror, is whimsical, ironic, even cynic at times; and it substitutes CGI for clever story-telling and cinematography measuring the highs and lows of the social ladder with visual precision. In short, ingredients for a less in-your-face, decisively creeping-up-on-you kind of comedy drama of caliber, falling into line with Bong's other early outstanding effort ""Memories of Murder.""  ""Parasite"" is an all-out visual genre mix of the first order, as much commentary about western society's underbelly and upper class as it is a ghost story drawing from a long Asian tradition. Things are in play that have always been lingering deep down underneath and come back to haunt us, metaphorically - and literally. In that sense the film is as much a thriller as it is fun stuff and dead serious drama, a bit like an attempt at squaring a circle, and yet it works.  ""Parasite"" is also the ultimate staircase film, to name just one striking image. This owes itself to the implied fairy-tale lore that at the end of the staircase - society's equivalent for the romantic rainbow - you'll find a pot of gold, right? It's just that stairs work in both directions, and climbing them up or down is less romantic. Bong Joon Ho makes staircase construction his art and builds them vicious circle-like. Consider this circle squared."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"Four highly coveted Oscars (including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay), being awarded to a foreign-language film, is an unprecedented event in my memory. This makes Parasite (South Korean 2019 tragicomedy) a must-see movie. Having just come out of the theatre, I can admit in all sincerity that the film has affected me on multiple levels. But before broaching the poignant essentials, should firstly dispense with the banal, which I expect the woke and self-righteous movie-goers are likely to focus on. These will undoubtedly include such predictable clichés as injustices of income inequality, disdain of the chauffeur-driven elite towards ""smelly"" subway riders, aloof callousness to the upper classes, etc. These elements are undeniably featured in the film, but purely as a foil for a deeper exploration of the human psyche, which deserves to be examined with some specificity. Viewer warning: Parasite, while a monumental piece of cinematic work, is not a joyous viewing experience. The unrelenting intensity, unleashed on the viewer almost from the start (not too dissimilar to that of observing a circus acrobat on a tight rope without the safety net), is sustained without respite throughout the two-hour-plus duration. Armed with only a cursory knowledge of the South Korean society, culture, and class hierarchy, I felt somewhat disadvantaged, particularly during the early scenes. At the risk of being exceedingly presumptuous, I fear that most of the US movie-going public might be in the same boat, despite the prominence of the ubiquitous Samsung, KIA Motors and other Korean brands permeating global markets. If not for the omnipresent media denunciations of its dangerously unpredictable neighbor to the north, we would probably know even less about the Region. While ignorance is generally considered to be a bliss, in the case of Parasite, not knowing the Korean societal dynamics, one can't help but experience the frustrations of cognitive dissonance right from the start. On the one hand, we are presented with: While on the other hand: The initial culturally ""foreign"" element driving the dissonance is that despite the unambiguously self-reliant and skilled family members, the mother feels she needs to kick the husband out of his slumber to ""come up with the plan"". An accomplished hammer-thrower evidently needs a man to do the heavy lifting (pun intended) when it comes to figuring out options for protecting the family or improving its finances. What makes these incompatible realities even more disjointed is the apparent inability of the siblings, who clearly exhibit an above-average portfolio of skills, to claim their proper station in society. The brother, while devoid of formal university education, has superior math, English and college entrance test-acing skills. The sister, in addition to her mastery of drawing and appealing looks, has perfected the improv and BS artistry to such an extent that in any meritocratic setting she would easily achieve a distinguished career in marketing, politics or screenplay writing. The film creators are seemingly posing a two-part question: 1. is it the social status and family pedigree, rather than merit, that acts as a dominant determinant of one's ability to succeed; or perhaps... 2. it is a self-inflicted limitation imposed by one's own belief system that places the current circumstance or family history to be the obstacle to advancement? The filmmakers are hinting at the latter by incorporating the heavy rock imagery, introduced to the audience in a form of a gift by a family friend (looks more like a ginormous paperweight, rather than heirloom). The brother becomes so inextricably linked to the rock, particularly during periods of high stress, that he seems unable to separate himself from it no matter where he goes. Predictably (in keeping with Chekhov's dramatic principle) this heavy rock becomes the instrument of his near demise. Curiously, it is the same metaphorically tuned brother who misses such an obvious boulder of a symbol (again pun intended). However, it is the juxtaposition of the affluent Parks vs the poor Kims in the film that takes the cake (definitely, pun intended). An unspoken shield seems to reliably insulate the wealthy from various external forces. While a heavy downpour can dispossess the slum dwellers of their property entirely, it is only a minor inconvenience for the wealthy (down to the leak-proof pretend American Indian tents). While basements of the rich can withstand a nuclear attack from the pot-bellied dictator north of the border, any substantial deluge simply drowns basements (or basement homes, as the case might be) of the poor in raw sewage. Another purpose of incorporating the heavy rain scene into the film is to remind us that often ""when it rains, it pours"". That is, while the Kims managed to cleverly contrive themselves into the Parks' household, the elation proved to be short-lived as they discovered other subterranean dwellers in the Parks' house, whose status is even lower than that of the Kims, leading to dramatic disequilibrium to a comfortable and promising situation. According to the filmmakers, while the invisible walls of wealth and privilege protect the affluent class from external threats, no one is safe when it comes to the ""enemy within."" The message here seems to be that as long as the class resentment is obvious and inter-class mobility is driven by factors other than merit (e.g., antecedent, lack of connections, body odor, cheap underwear or any other subjective and artificial boundaries) the risk of societal discontent is always lurking in the background, bringing the fragility of human existence to the forefront, often causing the innocent to suffer. The carnage scene in the latter part of the film, while abrupt and sudden, can indeed be foreshadowed as a natural consequence of open expression of disdain that Parks Sr. signals to Kim Sr. in no uncertain terms. Where I struggle with my interpretation of the film is the title. There are no obvious parasites in the plot. Even the subterranean male dweller performs light sensor duties at appropriate moments, thereby communicating his respect and appreciation. The Kims dutifully fulfill their respective roles. While the Parks Sr. works for his money. Perhaps the idea behind the title is to suggest that there is a symbiotic feeding off one another that remains fundamentally destructive as long as the gulf between societal layers remains unbridged. Not sure. Need to think about it some more. Nine out of ten."
기생충,Parasite,2019,,,"Amazing !! Mind blowing!!! If you haven't watched it yet, watch it right now"
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"It's a Will Ferrell comedy. Yep, a Will Ferrell comedy.  ""Poor family outsmarts a clueless, out-of-touch rich family and takes over the house"" is absolutely a Will Ferrell comedy plot.  Ignore how beautiful the movie looks: the poor family's cramped, dirty house and the rich family's pristine, futuristic house.  Ignore the fact that it's a foreign film: There must be a least a few people who LOVED the film because it's in a different language and liking the film makes them smart.  If this was a Will Ferrell movie or a Steve Martin movie and it had the same dialogue and zany schemes, you would think the movie was average. Or maybe even terrible. One scene included the daughter leaving her underwear in the rich parents' car to trick them into thinking the driver had sex in it.  Maybe the Will Ferrell/Steve Martin comparison is a little bit melodramatic. My point is, if you set aside the fact that it's an immensely well made foreign film (on a technical level!), Parasite is weak when it comes to characters and storytelling.  There are no memorable characters in this movie (except for maybe a character that showed up near the end of the film, but only because he was so over-the-top). A perfect example is the poor family. They're basically the same person.  For the most part, the rich couple are the usual snooty, dimwitted suburban snobs we've seen in plenty of mainstream garbage comedies.  Most of the story is just the exchange between the poor family and the rich family. The back-and-forth between them was interesting, but definitely not Oscar-worthy.  It's a bit difficult to rate the acting if the movie is in a different language. As far as I can tell, the acting was just okay. No groundbreaking performances. Just people sitting (or standing) around and talking with a few wacky comedic moments.  Oh and there's a murder at the end that feels out of place.  Obviously, movie isn't terrible. The visuals were incredible. The scene where the poor family's neighborhood was consumed by a flood was gorgeous.  I enjoyed the film, but I wouldn't say it's the greatest film ever."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,A fantastic film that holds your attention from the first frame to the last. I was totally captivated by the story and the cast did an amazing jobs of creating memorable characters. Loved the twists in the plot and the feeling that the photography gave. An excellent piece of work! Bravo!
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"I'm a little biased in that I've seen all of Bong Joon-ho's movies and have a heart for Korean cinema in general, but I can say without bias that this movie delivers on the hype. I'll be honest I was avoiding this as I kinda knew going in it was probably going to be depressing and horrifying. There's a running theme in the cinephile community that Korea has it's genre of film, unique unto itself. In Hollywood, films often go through 5 or more drafts that start with big amorphic ideas and edge closer toward crowd pleasing sometimes until they're just 90 minute commercials for the lead actors career. Korean film seems to lack that filter of cost X audience X test screening -+ = blah blah blah. They take big ridiculous ideas and drive them towards the powerful nebulous first draft finish line no matter how emotional draining or traumatic. In a word, Korean cinema can be very ""dark"".  Bong Joon-ho has a special talent for creating 4 dimensional characters, larger than the circumstances in the film and when the payoff comes for them it's likely to cause heart palpitations.  Parasite is a film about grifters who invade a rich family's home, but this is no simple film about ""Oh no when will the family figure them out!?"". This is far bigger and far more shocking. Obviously it's an amazing movie. This little blurb is more here to be a warning. Gird your heart strings when heading into this."
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"A surprisingly interesting film. I absolutely did not expect such a plot. I put off watching for a long time, but when I decided, I never regretted it."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Parasite (Gisaengchung) (2019) is directed and written by Bong Joon Ho. It is a thriller that tells the story of a poor, Lower class family that slowly worm their way into the household of a rich, upper class family. One by one the family get hired to do a job, with the employers unaware that they are a family. Things take an unexpected turn in the third act and I can honestly say that I wasn't expecting the way that this movie ended up. I really enjoyed Parasite and in my opinion, it deserves the Academy Awards that it won."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"This film is full of symbolism that gives it amazing rewatchability. It meshes heist, humor, and horror genres incredibly well all while delivering important social commentary."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Parasite (2019) is a South Korean dark comedy movie written and directed by Bong Joon Ho. This was the first movie I watched from this filmmaker's filmography as it was being praised by every movie reviewer in YouTube and I loved it. After rewatching the movie for this review, I can still say that this movie is still a bonafide cinematic masterpiece.  Positives for Parasite (2019): First off, the movie's premise is very simple and is elevated by the phenomenal writing and directing from Bong Joon Ho. The movie is about a poor family infiltrating the life of a wealthy family and all the shenanigans you would expect to happen in a movie like this does happen in the most hilarious amd absurd ways possible. The acting from the cast is brilliant and everyone is give it their all in the movie. The movie's comedy is some of the best I've seen in any movie in a long time. The movie is extremely well paced with its over 2-hour runtime. There is some dark stuff that happens here in the most ridiculous and absurd ways imaginable. And finally, I loved the ending to this movie as it felt very natural for the story and it was very smart in the way with how it was being executed.  Overall, Parasite (2019) is an instant classic of modern cinema, it is my favorite South Korean movie and it is one of my favorite movies in the history of cinema."
기생충,Parasite,2019,,,Absolutely the best film of the year. An amazing blend of all genres. What wonderful execution.
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"Don't get me wrong, it's ok, but the critic and user reviews are truly astounding. It's spoken about like it's some marvel of cinema, when in reality is a mediocre story, heavily laden with obvious ""social and financial injustice"".  It'll pass an afternoon, it won't stay with you forever."
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"I thought it was a well made film, decent twist at the end but it's no where near as much of a ""masterpiece"" as some fanboys are making it out it be."
기생충,Parasite,2019,2,,A mediocre movie. Did not get at all what all fuss is about.
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I was reluctant to watch this. I could see from the trailer that it has good production value, yet I was worried it would be too weird, being a Korean/an Asian language thriller. Eventually I did watch it and I am glad! I'm also glad it won all those Oscars.  The blend of dark comedy in this social thriller definitely attributed to an enjoyable and entertaining experience and made me more engaged with the story. It is very well made and it deals with various interesting subjects/issues of our society, all in the premise of a collision of social classes (extreme poverty with extreme wealth)."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"After watching some good films in 2019, there were only a few that really blew me away. I'm a big ""Avengers - Endgame"" fan, but ""The Irishman"" and especially ""The Lighthouse"" really touched me. And now we have ""Parasite"" by Bong Joon-ho, the South Korean director of ""The Host"" and ""Snowpiercer"". ""Parasite"" was the first South Korean film to win the golden palm at the Cannes Film Festival and garnered tons of good reviews. Recently it also won four Academys, amogst other things of course ""Best Picture"". Logically, I was interested.  The Kim family lives on a subsistence level and takes every opportunity to improve their situation. How fitting that one day the son receives an offer to help a wealthy family ...  The less you know about ""Parasite"", the better! Nevertheless, I try to rate the film as best as possible without giving anything away.  What is the best way to describe ""parasite""? It´s not easy, because the genre of the film alone is not easy to grasp. The film works here and there as a satire, can surprise with some really funny moments, but also has very metaphorical scenes and then suddenly becomes scary and exciting. And that's all an understatement. ""Parasite"" always surprised me. In a moment you suspect you know what kind of film it is, but then there is the first twist and then the next and I was always surprised. Few films can do that. Joon-ho stages a masterful, socially critical film that works on so many levels. The visual level, for example, is fantastic, ""Parasite"" works with grotesque, but nevertheless appropriate exaggerations, which sometimes are difficult to bear in terms of their message and strength. The name of the film gives a wonderful hint of what to expect.  All actors are fabulous and deserve the greatest recognition, because it is not just the terrific script or the equally fabulous direction that make ""Parasite"" so effective. I especially liked Song Kang-ho as father of the Kims!  Technically, ""Parasite"" offers creative and sometimes breathtaking camera settings. Some spectacular sets were built for the film, such as the Kims' family home. The editing is great and Jeong Jae-il's score was also wonderfully integrated into the visuals; everything just fits here!  Conclusion: You have to see ""Parasite""! It is one of those films that certainly offers something for everyone, but at the same time brings with it so much intelligence and strength that I am amazed and happy at the same time that this South Korean work is so well received by the audience. Without a doubt one of the best films of 2019. A masterpiece, a must-see and in a way also an important film, I think. Terrific!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Hi At first glance at the movie It looks simple But I sink deep into the film Throughout the film, one looks at the power of thinking and the power of man himself But wealth is everything And poverty incapacity Thanks"
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"Problem with Bong's movies is that they have very strong message. Snowpiercer, Okja, and now Parasite. Problem is that they're Bong's perspectives. And he wants to shove it down the audience's throat. And it's again apparent in this movie. It's painfully clear what he's trying to say in this movie... so apparent that it's immature. He's almost telling you what to feel and think at each moment.  And this trend in movies thesedays troubles me. In the old days, movies just told a story. And what each audience takes away are all their own and mostly different. What someone got out of Rocky was different that someone else. Now it's all telling you what to feel and what to think. And this trend is evident in games as well. Before, you had to explore and use creativity to solve puzzles and quests. Now, the games all tell you where to go and what to do. People are getting dumber and dumber thanks to these type of games and movies. It's actually opposite of what this movie is trying to say."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"This movie is phenomenal, it's epic, exciting, funny, has the awesome ultra-violent in the third act of the movie, it's so unique and powerful that it's so cool! This movie is just a masterpiece, and however hates it is just weird, because it's perfect in any way you look at!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"After watching the Oscars I was curious about Parasite and knew I would have to watch it. I wasn't disappointed at all, most times when people hype something up I tend to think it's overrated. I was rooting for this down on their luck family even though they were technically committing a crime. Who hasn't lied on a resume to get a job ? I didn't see the ending coming at all so that was a shock."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"Parasite is a very enjoyable film. There are no heroes in this story, just tragic anti-heroes. The first half of the film is a convenient build-up to a spectacular second half. It is a satire that pits the have and have-nots against each other. Morality is lost somewhere in the need for survival. It's a enjoyable film with an unexpected ending. Definitely worth a watch for a Cinema-lover. The subtitles are not hard to follow for a Non-Korean audience. I dropped it from 8 stars to 7 because of some voice-over narration towards the end that was very different from the tone of the rest of the film."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"Besides it is a huge narrative, it is also a really politic picture. Easily the best movie in 2019 and one of the most important film of the decade."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,This is my firsy review ..to be hones I am very proud to write my first review for this incredible movie .. No words can describe it . The crew the filming the story .. Wow Korea give us a great hope and open to us a big door after a lot of disappointments in Hollywood this year ... I want to give it 10/10 but I have problem with ending .. it make me a little bit disappointed at the first I think the movie have a great message that says '' every dollar you pay today tommorow in future you will get it'' but the ending destroyed this quote .. at all thx for this great masterpiece 👏🏻👏🏻
기생충,Parasite,2019,1,,"So I finally saw Parasite and after weeks and weeks of hearing about how great this movie is...  What am going to tell you, those who didn't watch it yet..  Please don't. Please don't waist your time on this BS. No Plot, no acting, no music, no dialogs, no nothing.  What was it? Oscars winner? Were they kidding? :("
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I have seen this film 2 times, and in the middle of the third. I was introduced to this film via an Alternative Cinema class for my University, otherwise I would probably have never seen this film. As the title states, this film is captivating from the very first scenes.  I rather enjoy being drawn into a story by quick witted individuals and the family in Parasite are no exception. I will not go into the story as more professional writers than me have already done so. However, I will go into what I (a cinema fan) thought.  The film is primarily driven by the plot. There is no need for violence (at least for a majority of the film) to keep you engaged. Each chapter in the film perfectly leads to the climax, allwhile being fed foreshadowing details that are revealed in the final act. Korean cinema is juxtaposed by American cinema, and we have to appreciate what they do differently, and better.  If you want to have a good laugh, just sort this film's reviews by lowest rating first XD."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"When my boyfriend suggested watching 'Parasite' I was reluctant, but I'm incredibly glad I said yes. It's a captivating movie that offers a wide range of genres.  Throughout the movie, Parasite illustrates how wealth inequality is the result of factors largely outside one's control, that class differences aren't totally earned, and social mobility is a bygone dream for many. The movie have the potential to resonate with audiences from all cultural backgrounds.. Director Bong Joon-ho's meticulous storytelling and brilliant cinematography create a gripping narrative that explores the complex dynamics of class struggle with both wit and depth. The film's seamless blend of dark comedy, suspense, and social commentary kept me on the edge of our sofa until the end.  I found the storyline to be thought-provoking.  The cast performs well, and it really sparked an interesting conversation.  'Parasite' is a must-watch that leaves a lasting impact."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"The blurring of the rich-poor divide occurs when the poor family becomes increasingly entangled in the life of the wealthy family they pretend to serve. The usage of the home as a symbol emphasizes this theme, with the basement symbolizing the poor family's poverty and the upstairs signifying the affluent family's money and privilege.  The film also focuses on the concept of the ""parasitic single,"" which refers to adult children who live with their parents and are unable to leave owing to a lack of work and financial security. It also depicts the influence of capitalism on individuals and how difficult it is to break out from the cycle of poverty.  The film also emphasizes the topic of survival, as the impoverished family would go to any length to live, even if it means misleading and manipulating the wealthier family.  It's crucial to remember that this film is a social commentary and a mirror of present society's reality; it may be uncomfortable to see, but it's necessary to comprehend the message it's attempting to portray.  Bong Joon-ho directed the 2019 South Korean black comedy thriller film Parasite. The narrative follows the Kim family, an impoverished family of four living in a tiny semi-basement apartment. When the son, Ki-woo, is given the opportunity to teach the Park's daughter, they become entangled in the life of the rich Park family. As Ki-woo gets increasingly involved in the Parks' life, the rest of the Kim family begins to enter the Parks' lives in various ways, with each member taking on a position as a tutor or employee.  The film tackles issues of class struggle and social inequity, as the Kim family's actions set in motion a chain of events that reveal the two families' underlying tensions and secrets. The film also deals with themes of greed and the consequences of actions.  The performances of the ensemble, and the film's unusual combination of genres. It was the first South Korean film to win the Palme d'Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival. It also won Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay, becoming Bong Joon-ho the first Asian director to win Best Director at the Oscars.  The film received widespread praise for its superb acting, director, storyline, and depiction of societal concerns and class conflict. It was also a box office triumph in South Korea and internationally.  When Parasite was released, it gained critical praise, with many applauding Bong Joon-directing.  Parasite is a complicated film that explores a variety of topics and subjects that may make viewers uncomfortable, including class disparity, poverty, and the rich's abuse of the poor. The film also addresses the concept of deceit, as the film's impoverished family pretends to be someone they are not in order to get entry to the rich household. Furthermore, the film's finale is unexpected and may be upsetting to some viewers.  It's natural for people to react differently to a film, and it's vital to remember that art is subjective and can elicit various feelings in different people.  Parasite is a thought-provoking and expertly constructed film that addresses complicated societal themes in an original and fascinating manner. Its unique combination of genres, great performances, and expert directing by Bong Joon-ho make it a must-see picture."
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"Not gonna lie, the Overrated-ness of Parasite is starting to get to me. When I first saw it at the cinema I was very impressed, but after some thought I think it's probably closer to an 8 objectively. The last 30 minutes in particular drag it down somewhat. Not really a huge fan of the direction it takes. I simply don't get what on God's Green Earth made this one of the highest rated movies of all-time on some websites and listings. It's pretty baffling and far from being a flawless movie. That being said, I still like it. The Black and White Version added nothing to it though. If anything it made it pretentious for absolutely no reason.  7.5/10."
기생충,Parasite,2019,,,"Parasite has it all. Direction, acting , screenplay and camerawork are all award level.  This film is not boring, and the first hour is about as fascinating and attention grabbing as a movie can be. The second hour is not quite as successful as the first, in my opinion, but is still high level entertainment.  The key to Parasite is the script, which is tasked with leading the viewer through a myriad of pinpoint plot developments that always seem to be teetering on a razors edge. I feel safe to say this is one of the best screenplays of the 21st century.  If I had to summarize Parasite it would be , ""never a dull moment""."
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"I likes this movie, I don't believe it did anything wrong but it{s also not better than many other films that are 8+ on IMDB, I thin it just got a little overhyped there hasn't been that many great films in recent memory. I would put this one on the same level as ""Knives Out"" or for example, a great film all around, entertaining, thought provoking, funny, easily digestible and memorable, but even with all those positives, I would not say its better than, for some examples, The Departed, Whiplash, Casablanca, Good Will Hunting. Lawrence of Arabia, Wolf of Wallstreet, even Three Billboards etc. Although to be fair there are many films with an 8+ average that should not be as high as they are either like Joker, and even som 7's that deserve to be 8+ like Tenet, it was just a little hard to grasp everything with 1 view and no subtitles, or Babylon, which was crazy, but it was also beautiful in it's own way.  Anyway I am getting a little off the rails but the point is that when I saw it as number 36 in IMDBs top 250 it feels unfair for many other films that may be a littler harder to digest for the average person, but have a lot more substance. Is it a good film? Yes it is a great film, definitely recommended for just about anyone, but is it top 40 of all time? No, perhaps top 40 of it's decade at best but as someone who has watched a lot of films, I seriously doubt it would even be top 100, maybe top 150."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,One of the most over rated movie of all time. It was good and one time watch movie but not worth all the hype it good because of being a foreign movie and people want to appreciate it but the appreciation went too far. And it got the awards like oscars because of less competition.
기생충,Parasite,2019,1,,"I don't understand what the intention of the director is? What does he want to explain or to prove? Is it a critic of social inequalities? Is it a thriller? A comedy? I don't know and none of these styles is addressed adequately. This movie is clearly overrated. For sure, it is deranged and make you feel very uncomfortable sometimes. But for what purpose? I don't know. It proves one thing: that the Cannes festival is a get-together of crazy bonkers who call themselves artists - which clearly they are not."
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"For me, Bong Joon-Ho's movies were clearly not my type before, because I thought they were too boring, I had to quit while I'm watching all those his movies, except Snowpiercer.  Anyway, since I was in theatre, and I have never left a theatre before, and also was thinking that I have never gonna watch this movie again, so I fought against my desire to leave. That, was my best movie-related choice of that year.  Even though first half was little boring as similar as other works of his, maybe too loose. But, as the scene goes by, tremendously natural looking visual effects, plots, and details were getting so tight and natural, concentration level of myself was also increased.  I felt the mise en scène of every scenes were highly calculated, and there were some scenes that doesn't fit the standard rules of ratio or direction and arrangement , but even those things that supposed to look like mistakes were pretty. That was the moment that I felt the director is so talented.  Parasite was an opportunity to make me able to think, watch and feel a movie in a different perspective. So, even though Bong-Joon-Ho's works are not my type of movies, I was highly inspired by this one."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Amazing movie, just watch it! So many emotions, so many great Amazing movie, just watch it! So many emotions, so many great."
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"I would not rate this as the ""Best Movie of the Century "" like some hyperbolic reviewers. But. It is excellent and very well done. The story keeps you engaged throughout. I would rate even higher, but I thought the ending did not live up to the quality of the story which led up to it. Nonetheless, no arguments here about its status as the Oscar winner for Best Picture of the year. It probably deserves that title."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Rife with metaphor and social commentary, Parasite brilliantly juxtaposes the three families portrayed through its filmography and stunning and meticulous visual construction. A black comedy, horror and thriller all at once, the film manages to transcend genres and redefine the idea of a staircase film. Each and every frame serves to emphasize the line between the two classes, and by its end, we are left wondering who the parasite referenced in the title is.  I thought some characters were a touch underdeveloped and some plot points unexplored, but I have no qualms about giving this a full 5 stars. Beautiful movie, great script, great acting, consistent style, deeply rooted themes. As near perfection as a film can be.  10/10: Sublime. Genre transcendent. Cannot say enough."
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"Not my cup of tea. Farce combined with excessive violence, and lots of plot holes as well as character inconsistencies, but what do I know?"
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"Great movie lived up to all of the hype, definitely a must see👍"
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"It's not a bad movie, it's a good perspective on society and what money creates. But I couldn't agree less with Oscar for best motion picture, come on, so good movies in 2019! WTF Hollywood?"
기생충,Parasite,2019,4,,I am absolutely baffled as to the reason why this film has received such praise. Best movie of the decade? Best Picture of the year? Uhmmm no way no how. The movie was perfectly fine. I'd go so far as to say it was an average movie... perfectly fine. Certainly not a film I would watch ever again though. 1917 was amazing in my opinion and should've easily walked away with Best Picture.
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"This film is a great metaphor, I really have a lot to say about this film, starting from the fact that I was very hesitant at the beginning of the film, but going forward this film managed to put me to the test during the development of the story, a very psychological film, it must be said that the plot is very banal but they really developed it well, it obviously has its own flowing plot, and obviously the idea of replacing the family to have a stable job for the whole family is a stroke of genius, obviously it couldn't all go rosy, so the usual plots are there, the ending is what obviously struck me a lot because even though the father wanted to do ""good"" for his family he found himself in the end to be just a ""parasite"" from my totally personal point of view this film is really beautiful recommended."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,Best movie for greedy people. One should not so greedy that after sometime he fall down on his own net.
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"While I do think that it is ever so slightly overrated, I can't help but acknowledge the very artistic directing, symbolism, and acting that went into this film. Some parts make you laugh, some parts make you feel very sympathetic, and many parts make you feel oddly uncomfortable but in a good way that makes the movie pretty enjoyable! We definitely do live in different parts of society with different luxuries and experiences that are misunderstood by the other."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,A slow paced thriller that highlights the social class divide... superbly directed and esp a powerful development of characters... a great movie with little disappointing conclusion...
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"Parasite starts with an endearing family of characters and continues the familial theme until the cows come home. The direction and photography are impeccable, but perhaps not worth the watch time.  While I wanted to see the family get into more hijinks (my favorite act was the 1st), the story decided to sit at this house of rich people (to examine the class divide I imagine), and I was a little disappointed.  However, the house holds a few remarkable secrets, and the anxiety I felt watching this family blend in was palpable, and it didn't hurt that the actors had great chemistry and humor going.  I also enjoyed how the naturalistic directing style contrasted with the insanity of the last act.  Give it a watch!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,,,"Joon-Ho Bong is a true master of story telling. The concept of Parasite is tremendously original, yet feels simple and close to life, and as the story progresses, unexpected twists and imagination are around every corner. The entire film is well chiseled in every aspect. The use of color and the overall cinematography/editing of the film is top class not just for an Asian film, but for any Hollywood blockbusters. Pairing Bong with the strong cast also makes the film a no-doubter masterpiece. At the end of the day, the colorful group of characters are what will be remembered the most, each and every one of them is worth savoring and are honestly beautifully crafted. Bong is also able to illustrate the inner psyche of class difference in Asian societies, where class discrepancy is wide and is one of the most significant social issue. The film is able to dive into this through a creative story that perhaps wouldn't exist anywhere else in the world, and could be food for thought for both spectrums of the scale."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"The movie is definitely well made and has a good twisted ending but to be honest, it is nothing special. I watched it because of so many great reviews and awards and while I loved the slick way it moved instead of being slow - I have watched enough such movies in Indian cinema to know that it is not a masterpiece."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Parasite is a South Korean film directed by Bong Joon-ho that tells the story of the impoverished Kim family, who are struggling to make ends meet in a society marked by economic inequality. The film follows the family as they become involved in the lives of the wealthy Park family, ultimately leading to a series of unexpected and explosive events.  One of the standout features of Parasite is its brilliant storytelling. Bong Joon-ho masterfully weaves together a complex and multi-layered narrative that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. The film is full of twists and turns, and just when you think you have it all figured out, something unexpected happens. The pacing is perfect, with just the right balance of tension and humor, and the characters are well-developed and believable.  The acting in Parasite is top-notch, with standout performances from the entire cast. Song Kang-ho, who plays the head of the Kim family, is particularly impressive, conveying a wide range of emotions with subtlety and nuance. The cinematography is also excellent, with beautiful shots that perfectly capture the mood and tone of the film.  Overall, Parasite is a masterful film that is not to be missed. It is a poignant commentary on social inequality and the human condition, and it is also a thrilling and entertaining ride. Highly recommended."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,Cannot understand why it can win important award???
기생충,Parasite,2019,1,,"This movie is flat-out horrible. Not funny, not interesting, a hard watch. Way over-hyped. Had to shut it off half way through. Zero interest to watch it again."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"Writer/director Bong Joon Ho pulls off another sharp genre film with a darkly comedic twist - after tackling serial killers (Memories of Murder, 2003), monsters (The Host, 2006), science fiction (Snowpiercer, 2013, the only one I did not like) and child-and-her-pet genre (Okja, 2017), it's time for the family drama with a dash of Hitchcockian thriller.  The poor but cunning Kim family infiltrates the rich Park family through a series of deceptions, as the Kims discredit the previous domestic workers to replace them one by one, fabricating fake credentials. However, the Park house hides a dark secret which throws the Kims' plan into chaos. To say more would be a shame.  This is, for me, Bong's best movie since The Host, possibly even since Memories of Murder, boasting perfect editing, fine performances (the great Kang-ho Song, Bong's long-time collaborator, plays the patriarch of the poor family) and clever visual storytelling. The attention to details is stunning: the film has a strong vertical structure, with the road to the Parks house ascending into the sunlight while the journey back to the Kims' basement is a long, dim descent; the two great windows of the houses contrast each other, with the Parks' showing a gorgeous garden and the Kims' a squalid alley populated by drunkards; when a Native Americans-themed birthday turns into something far more sinister, a character's face is smeared with blood in a way to resemble war paintings.  The script is worthy of these remarkable visuals and finds a miraculous balance between comedy, tragedy and tension.  8,5/10"
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"To quote director, Bong Joon Ho, ""I'd like to say as little as possible here, because the film is best when you go into it cold."" That being said, this picture has it all, drama, suspense, mystery and thrills. It has an effective slow build that culminates to a tension filled conclusion."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"Ngl this do be kinda lit. I really like the dynamic the family has with each other, and I love the contrast between the poor family with the misery they live through and the rich family with their perfect and happy lives."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"This is a rare piece of perfection in a world of mediocrity.  South Korean movies have been well received for some time now, and this one is no exception.  Nothing should be added, nothing should be removed, its amazing as it is.  Its terrifying, horrible, sad, eerie, scary, funny and gloomy.  Acting is very good, and so are the costumes and scenery.  I will never look at peaches the same way after watching this movie.  I loved the wifi situation, and their solution to the problem, and the way the father was so proud of his daughter, being able to falsify.  This is a rare piece of perfection in a world of mediocrity.  Nothing should be added, nothing should be removed, its amazing as it is.  Its terrifying, horrible, sad, eerie, scary and gloomy.  Acting is very good, and so are the costumes and scenery.  I'll have to repeat it all, since imbd requires me to write 600 words, and nobody's got time for that."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Fantastic movie, I really liked it. History, script, actors, it was really a very good work."
기생충,Parasite,2019,,,"First of all , the movie doesnt contain good story and the movie doesnt connect you. .The hype promised an intense thriller with clever twists and biting social commentary. What I got instead was a messy story full of unlikable characters, unrealistic turnsI kept waiting for that gripping suspense people talk about - it never came. The rest of the characters are cardboard cutouts. Rich family = dumb and naive. Poor family = smart but unethical. That's as deep as it gets.he so-called ""twist"" doesn't feel earned - it just drops out of nowhere.the story rely so heavily on random coincidences and exaggerated drama. There is no character development."
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"This is a well-made film but is far from achieving masterpiece status, and those who are capriciously throwing that word around must be cinematically starved. To give a movie an Academy Award for best picture and best director without nominating any of its actors is indicative of the fact that while the film's screenplay is definitely intriguing, character development is sorely lacking, along with any kind of memorable performances. Did the director direct a gang of ghosts? The message of the film is politically correct, and although I agree with it, I see this as just another ""Green Book"" cop out. I'm also appalled that the movie glorifies violence as a solution to economic disparity, a disparity that is directly attributable to governments and not as individualistically motivated as this movie so strongly suggests. Good film? Yes!! Masterpiece and Best Picture of The Year? Absolutely Not!! And we might as well just do away with the foreign film category now that this boundary no longer seems to mean anything."
기생충,Parasite,2019,5,,"Actually this movie is not that brilliant! It has a good start, but then the plot is just disappointing. The end ruins the whole movie. The occuring violence is a very simple move to finish the messed up plot.  And do not expect good acting or realistic characters. It is just overacting."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Bong Joon Ho Is No Stranger To Masterfull Storytelling And Directing And Eversince He Made "" Memories of Murder "" (Which Is An Amazing Film) He Has Been Uping His Own Game. The Directing In This Film Is One Word Superb. And The Story Of Poor And Rich Are Told Masterfully , This Film Is So Touching That After The Credits Roll You Have A Smile On Your Face Despite The Darkness And Sorrow The Mivie Conveys. That Is A Well Told Story , That Is Perfect Film Making."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,Bong Joon-ho delivers an engaging film that continues to get more engaging by the minute and lives up to and exceeds it's hype. The story goes from funny to thrilling to dark in the 132 minutes of a genius plot.
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"This is a film you either love or despise due to its portrayal of social desperation. If you don't like this film you may have missed many artistic cinematographic aspects related to the whole story and the subliminal messages within it about an unfair elitist society. It can be considered a grotesque film that keeps you watching and expectant of the unexpected till the end, which is so thrilling because it combines the sublime with horror at the same time. As Nolan implied in Inception, one more time, we come across with a film that incite us to be chasers not of dreams but of our own reality, in this case, at any cost."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"If Parasite would have come 5-6 years ago, it would have walked out of the Dolby Theater with just a single win in the foreign category and it would have burned my heart. I mean if you can't go beyond that cliched appreciation (of the best foreign-language film), despite touching such high artistic note of story-telling. And that too, just because of a mild language barrier and the politically driven format of Academy and other award shows, as a matter of fact."
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"Was quite sure what to expect when I started to watch this movie ""all sub-titled"" in Korean. But before I realized it I was reading the sub-titles and watching the movie action at the same time.  The story line is well written and very believable for the most part, there are some scenes a bit over done but all in all a fun and exciting movie to watch. I'm no new to foreign movies, having spent 22 years in the Navy and visited 48 countries one gets exposed to so many ""different"" things and cultures.  I was quite taken by the line the movie took as it progressed until and found it very funny in some aspects but also sad in what the family had to do to survive. Then came the ""garden party"" and it blew me away... I didn't see that coming but it was a good way to bring closure to a number of things.  Very glad I took the time to watch it, I very enjoyable movie."
기생충,Parasite,2019,,,"I have to admit that the main idea of this Korean film is very good. It is different from the majority of the films I have seen, but for me it was inadequate. The first 40-45 minutes are the main part of the movie. You understand what is going on. The rest of the movie is just a repeat of the first 40 minutes. It becomes boring. The acting is just good. Nice effort."
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"We see a family that gradually starts to feed off of a privileged family which is clear. But at the same time it showed us how it is actually the opposite, the privileged depending on the lower classes in a very disturbing way. The rich generic family needed a 'help' for almost everything in their life. For tutoring the kids(and much more than just tutoring academics), for making food, for supporting the mother who actually has no idea on how to live her life or form an opinion, for driving the father etc and even...for the dynamic between the husband and wife. It showed that most of their conversations were about the 'help'. This is in fact what most of the very privileged people do in society is depend a lot on the people doing work for them, and not see them as actual beings with their own families and lives. It is a form of usage that goes very far and the usage of the underprivileged in a very disproportioned power structure creates a co-dependant relationship. (E.g. The man adoring the master). And many times it costs a lot, for the underprivileged. The poor classes have no choice but to invest so much time in someone else's family, instead of in their own, because they need the salary. The upperclass knows this very well and abuses their power for this.  The dynamic of the 'poor' family in the movie was very enjoyable and pulled me in the movie. The story started out very interesting, but - to me - it fell flat towards the end. It could have been so much better , with a better storyline. Im not saying I want a happy ending and definitely am not a lover of clichés. I just wanted it to develop more. It feels that right in the middle of the development of the story it suddenly went flat. A nice movie, i don't care about awards (its all politics anyhow), a good one time watch, and maybe a rewatch to revisit the crazy antics in the beginning and middle of the movie. Favourite character : the poor dad."
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"Parasite seizes our expectations, breaks them down, builds them up, and knocks them down once more. This Korean masterclass assumes no clear genre, refusing to pigeonhole its ambition. Straddling the line between comedy, thriller, and horror, the production presents the conceptual 'parasite' as the underlying motif; it's a profound, tragic social commentary on classism as much as it is a satirical, sardonic throwaway remark on a parasite and its host. Decorated with multidimensional metaphors, signs and symbols, it would be criminal to not have a second or even third viewing to fully soak up Bong Joo-ho's flavoursome visual poetry.  Should you laugh or cry? Take sides, or simply observe the events unfold? In taking no clear stance does this movie most thrive. In stirring and string-pulling every capacity of human emotion while dodging the clichés does it tantalise the audience like few other productions have.  While slow in places, and with an occasional plothole, this was overall a gorgeously shot, satisfyingly unpredictable slice of thoughtful motion picture entertainment; presenting a particularly dark blend of black comedy.  8.4/10"
기생충,Parasite,2019,5,,Very over rated. I watched this movie because of its good reviews. Wasn't as good as it was rated.
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"This is the latest movie from South Korean director Bong Joon-ho, director of The Host, Okja, Snowpiercer and more. This is only the second movie of his that I have seen and it really makes me want to watch more! This movie is about a poor family who all get jobs working for a rich family as part of a scheme, and it just gets crazier from there. The performances are excellent, the story is interesting, it looks beautiful, it has comedy, it has suspense, it has horror, it has romance, it has everything! My only complaints are that the movie is a little slow in the first act and that sometimes the dialogue went by too fast for me to read the subtitles. This is good writing, and I feel like I missed some of it. I'm a pretty slow reader though, so your experience may differ. And yeah, the movie is presented in its original language and subtitled. If that's an issue for you, don't see it. You won't enjoy it. Otherwise, if you want an exciting and well-made movie that is completely original, go see this movie! It's one of the best of the year!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"A brilliant and razor-sharp social critique masterfully disguised as a thriller, this film strikes a perfect balance between dark humor, tension, and drama. With meticulous storytelling and exceptional direction, it draws the audience in from the very first scene and refuses to let go.  At its core, the film exposes the harsh realities of class struggles in a way that feels both universal and deeply unsettling. The narrative unfolds with an almost surgical precision, peeling back the layers of economic disparity, privilege, and survival with an unflinching gaze. Yet, it never loses its entertainment value-thrilling set pieces and unexpected twists keep the tension high, while moments of dark humor offer fleeting relief before plunging you back into unease.  What makes the film truly exceptional is its ability to shift tones seamlessly, keeping you on edge and making its social commentary hit even harder. Just when you think you know where it's headed, it veers into unexpected territory, forcing you to rethink everything. The cinematography, performances, and score all work in perfect harmony to create an experience that is as emotionally gripping as it is intellectually stimulating.  In a few words, this is a cinematic masterpiece-one that lingers in your mind long after the credits roll, challenging you to confront its themes and question the world around you."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie, but I was echanted with every twist and turn this movie presented. The pacing and shifts in the storyline melded together beautifully to create a captivating film. This movie is an instant classic that I could watch again and again. Wonderful and fun movie!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"I liked Parasite very much and had predicted that it would win the Oscar for best foreign language film - as it rightfully did !  However, I could never have imagined that Parasite would also win in the best picture category as well. Shouldn't the Academy's eligibility rules permit a film to enter in only ONE of these two categories ? ? ?"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,Good movie to watch when u are boring Really recommended!!
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"Parasite is slow to start but an enjoyable movie that takes you on a ride. It is a contender for the awards definetly and even though it won I am happy it did as I don't think there was a huge choice to be made. This year for me it was Joker, Richard Jewel and this.  There are some flaws but overall a wonderful piece of cinema beautifully crafted."
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"First half of the movie was really boring. Second half was kinda interesting though. An the ending was really really bad for my opinion. The other thing that was annoying is that the actors over played at times and the worse of all was the actor who played the boss lady . She was over playing and it was really annoying. I don't know if those were the directions but I did not like it at all. In conclusion not an Oscar worth movie, not a masterpiece..."
기생충,Parasite,2019,3,,"Much of the movie is okay, although uneventful. But end is horrifying. The general mood and tone of the film does a 360 degree turn. Most of the movie has a playful, comedic tone and seems to be a drama about two families divided by class. I had the sense that the screenplay, lacking enough depth or focus, ended things the way they ended because the writers weren't able to come up with much of anything. The plot was simply too thin. A wasted opportunity for a movie that otherwise might have been worthwhile. Remember when movies were supposed to be enjoyable and entertaining? Those were the days!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,Theme of the movie is unmatched. An experience of division between classes. Bringing reality so subtly onto the screen.
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,Orange beast and his supporters can stay fuming! Best Picture lol.
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I don't understand anyone giving this film anything less than a 9 or 10. It takes genius twists and turns, and I don't even usually like this genre! As for those not understanding certain character motives: please open your mind and consider cultural differences regarding boundaries, insults, manners, and class divides."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"This is a kind of a movie where you can never be disappointed. It is funny, it is ironic, it is still obsessing me"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Finally we have another all-Korean movie from the master.  Bong Joon-ho is back and is unpredictable as always.  Let me give you 5 reasons to watch this movie:  1) You love a good crime/drama/thriller.  2) You love Korean cinema with all your heart.  3) You love Song Kang-ho (how one can not love him?)  4) The script, acting and directing are perfect (as always when the Master is in business).  5) Does the Palme d'Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival ring a bell for you?  Welcome :)"
기생충,Parasite,2019,,,Good if you don't watch the last part of the movie.
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"I don't know what the fuss is all about this movie. After I watched the Oscars and to my surprise an Asian film lifting the top prize left me puzzled and at the same time very much excited. I immediately downloaded it and saw it in the middle of the night, the very same day. I won't say it's no good. It is brilliant but Oscar brilliant!!!! That's doubtful.  Our society is not equal and it can never be. That's the fact and we have to live with it. Just imagine a predator and a prey playing equal in mother nature. Chaotic, right?  Very well cinematographed, written, directed and acted but it was just unbelievable to always see rich guys play dumb and easily gullible. They are not like that. And poor and hungry always menacing, opportunistic type which is also stereotypical. Oscars is all about breaking the stereotype but the train has derailed I guess. So disappointed. There were a lot of films better then this one."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Not just a movie it's beautiful like a painting every scene, every shot, every moment is breathtaking and background score is apt and haunting....Bong Joon ho is the man"
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"If this deserves Oscar,"" get out"" deserves it too. It's a good movie, but lack of logic"
기생충,Parasite,2019,3,,The only good thing about this movie is...  Nothing.
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"This is the first movie that can take me places, from comedy to drama to romance to action to thriller to horror to all the combination that grips me speechless at the end of it. I watched it three times and it feels as great every time. Camera works are very structured, scenes are orchestrated almost mathematically they fill my heart so right. Acting is evenly of quality, no one outshines anyone else. Superb!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I normally do not watch subtitle movies yet the reviews, awards, and comments from friends had me curious. I am thrilled I saw it. Not sure what to make of it. Acting and photography was grand. I know I will watch it again. I missed parts of the subtitles because they went by too fast. I got the gist so I allowed it to play through. Rented it through Apple TV, watched it in the comfort of our home 😎"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"-Comedy -Drama -Thriller -Horror  Parasite is all that! an amazing movie about how you can work all your life and be miserable. Yeah, they are some mistakes, but it's a movie after all, so enjoy it!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"One of best crime/thriller i've watched. I can't guess where the plot will bring me, every minute in the movie i tried to guess but mostly i wrong, and got the unexpected, even the ending. Every character really has strong impact in the movie, and you must pay attention about every little detail they do, because that builds up the story, and has really deep meaning for the story. The movie itself is masterpiece, really worth watching."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,I wish I could give a thousand stars. This is a masterpiece and a love letter to cinema.
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Bong Joon-ho is a genius, and this movie is a masterpiece. That's it!"
기생충,Parasite,2019,,,"First half of the movie was okay, second half was much better. Overall it is very good movie. Great story not so great executed."
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,OK movie. Don't really see why people are claiming that it the director is always one step ahead. I personally felt that it was unrealistic and therefore had little sympathy for both sides of society.
기생충,Parasite,2019,8,,"I watched this film last night, just before the night when it woukd win 3 oscars. I can understand why it did win, though personally I can not say that I was blown away by it. Certainly it is entertaining and very very symbolic. At times I thought that they were inspired by Emir Kusturica's film Underground.  8 from me"
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,It's hard to define the genre of this movie. It starts as a subtle and enjoyable comedy before veering into overdone goriness. Reminded me of Chinese cinema of the 70ies. The theme of the movie is quite interesting and seems to be preoccupying more Korean directors (cfr. Burning from Chang-dong Lee) : the abusive crossing of social class lines... Too bad for the ending. My rating would have been higher would that have been subtle too. Still the movie is good and enjoyable.
기생충,Parasite,2019,5,,"To begin with I'm not a fan of Bong Joon-ho. I discover this almost by accident because I had no idea that he was behind Snowpiercer and the Netflix produced, Okja. I couldn't get through the first one and I fell asleep during the second. I gave this one a shot even though I knew that hyped movies are not my cup of tea. They seem to be self-reliant on the hype they generate, that somehow should be enough to reassure us, they'll leave us with an unforgettable memory.  So while this movie isn't bad and technically well-made, is far from unforgettable. It's heavy-handed and pushes the device of the screwball comedy far enough to make its subversion and consequent transformation into carnage, less plausible. A mechanism very dear to French director Francois Ozon, who Bong Joon-ho seems to be definitely indebted to.  A movie that certainly pleases the crowds with its grotesque and cynical satire and its deliberate use of violence. To quote Calvino: ""What many consider to be the vitality of the times - noisy, aggressive, revving and roaring - belongs to the realm of death, like a cemetery for rusty old cars."""
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Director Bong Joon Ho directed, wrote the screenplay and produced PARASITES. He deserved all the four Oscars that his film and he collected. There is something Tarantino-like about his style, in the way that he presents intersecting individuals from different social strata with apparently comic but definitely violent ultimate consequences. However, he is more polished than Tarantino was at the same age, and stage in his career.  He presents reality without judging: the Kims are a family of jobless and largely useless individuals who do not even know how to fold pizza boxes properly, who have no money for Wi-Fi, and find it only in a toilet in the strangest place in a house that I've ever seen.  The father - superbly played by Kang-ho Song - claims to have a plan but ultimately admits that the sole plan that won't fail is to have no plan. He tries to adapt to situations and is quick to react to any opportunity.  The mother is admirably played by Hye-jin Jang, a courageous and resilient fighter in the face of life's adversities, and a fantastic imitator of North Korean leaders' speech delivery styles.  Sun Kyun-Lee plays the son, a likeable young man who forges a university degree and copies a more successful friend's example, which will ultimately weigh him down like the rock that the friend gives him.  His sister, the extremely beautiful So-dam Park, is the most level-headed and intelligent of the lot, a quick thinker who has a touch for children.  The son finds a job as a teacher of English in a rich home run by a father who is often away on business in Paris, and a completely useless but physically gorgeous Yeo-jeong Jo (lovely legs!)  By first pulling in his sister to placate and teach painting to the bolshy child in the rich family, and then finding jobs in the household for his father and mother, the son gets the family's foot in the door to a world of wealth such as they had never imagined, and which they rapidly start wishing they could occupy. Needless to say, that can only be achieved with violence, and violence does indeed beget violence, surprises along the way notwithstanding.  Acting is of the highest standard by all, but I would like to single out Jeong-eun Lee as the governess who is allergic to peaches, who keeps her husband hidden in the rich house's basement. The sequences where she rings the bell during the torrential rain, and where she tries to open the passage to the basement are uniquely done.  Cinematography rates immaculate, with memorable sequences like the flood in the poorer sections of town -- in contrast with the safety in the higher grounds occupied by the rich; the scramble for the cell phone before a video can be sent from it; and the overhead shot of Kang-ho Song running into hiding after stabbing the rich homeowner.  Credible and gripping screenplay, fantastic action sequences. Completely deserved Best Picture Academy Award. 10/10."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,Such a perfect mirage of spoiled and discriminated minds and society we are living in.
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,For some reason the UK only got Parasite in cinemas in February so I've only just got the chance to see it. It's a great piece of filmmaking all around with great performances and a fantastic script.
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"I was bombarded by ppl recommending this movie to me so when I finally saw it, I was a bit underwhelmed - or you can say I was overhyped before. The main complaint - I was not ""blown away"" by any element of the movie. I know that's a high standard but with a score of 95 it should do exceptionally in some aspects. Instead, this movie did just ""pretty good"" in all of them.  Movie about class struggles might be new and exciting to US viewers but is - I don't want to say cliched - a pretty common theme in East Asia. Juxtaposing two closely-related group of characters with some uncrossable divides that ultimately result in conflict that reflects on the society itself is also a tried and true storytelling device.  Execution of the movie is professional and top-notch. Almost all actions by the characters have meticulous setups (some of them a bit in the face), which, on the bright side, shows the movie was extremely well-thought out and executed. Yet it simultaneously takes away any true element of surprise - a bit over-crafted, I'd say, which is a bit ironic in a highly choreographed dark humor genre movie but bear with me.  Character arcs are well-justified but predictable; was most impressed by the detailed and vivid portrayal of classism through a non-visual medium - smell. The juxtapositions of the underground v. above ground, the pre- and post- discovered housekeeper, and the weather changes vs the mood of the characters was effective but a bit on the nose.  Last, the cinematography was beautiful, the tone was unique and well-balanced, and the performance was amazing. Overall, a highly polished and accomplished movie. Yet I failed to see much ingenuity. It felt like the director hides behind his craftsmanship to avoid showing the audience his true self."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,One of the best movies of all time! Screenplay and directing are amazing. Acting is superb
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,One of the best movies I have ever seen. It teaches a lot about things we spot in everyday life. Movie starts from comedy to thriller.
기생충,Parasite,2019,,,"Perhaps it is a ""dark comedy"" that is ""hysterically funny"" as some reviewers wrote. Well, for me it ain't so. The pure nastiness and bloodletting in this movie reminds me of Fargo, which I loved but didn't find funny either. Come to think of it, this movie could have been written by the Coen brothers. It is very long and ultra creepy and I left the movie feeling slightly sick, kinda the way I felt after watching the Dutch version of the movie ""The Vanishing"". Is it a good movie? In terms of story telling, imagery, and acting, I suppose it is. Should you see it, expecting a good laugh? Definitely no! Even ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is funnier than this movie. Want to laugh? Go see ""Mr. Hulot's Holiday."""
기생충,Parasite,2019,7,,"Doesn't take much to please people nowadays! I don't buy the deep, multi-layered metaphorical masterpiece others talk about. It was a fairly simplistic commentary (given the runtime) on social class tensions.  That's it. Interesting plot but I feel it could have been delivered in a much more captivating way. I found the pace excruciating after a while once I understood the general message. Wasted opportunity.  Those giving it a 10 are not on this planet."
기생충,Parasite,2019,6,,"I do not understand the insane hype surrounding this movie. It was good. Just good. I'm a big Bong Joon Ho fan. And I get what he was going for here. Social commentary/satire with finesse. But he missed the mark with this one. This was no masterpiece, as almost everyone is calling it. Joon Ho did make a masterpiece. It just wasn't ""Parasite"". It was ""Okja"". Brilliant social commentary with a masterful ability to finesse. As far as ""Parasite"", like I said, it was just good. What keeps it from being great, in my opinion, is the fact that there were no likable characters. I didn't care at all about any of them. Big miss. There were many glaring plot holes, but I could have overlooked those if he had given me just one character to root for.It's like eating at a high end restaurant where nothing on the menu looks appealing to you. Disappointment. All of these 10 star reviews are just hive-mind on display."
기생충,Parasite,2019,4,,"I don't want to bash this film - it had a lot of very good qualities: Nice cinematography, well edited, good sound design, good art direction and decent acting. I'll go as far as to say the story was a very good premise and had incredible potential. BUT: No story is complete without good character development, and this is where this film fails CATASTROPHICALLY.  Here it is in a nutshell: WHO CARES?! Besides the imposter family (protagonists) being of low economic status, the writers make almost no effort to make this family likeable in any way shape or form. They are all pretty much detestable scumbags right out of the gate. There is ZERO conflict of interest or moral dilemmas as the family goes about their con games - you know, the kind of writing that would normally draw the audience in and generate sympathy for the protagonists as they make their poor and ultimately tragic decisions.  In any good tragic tale, the audience should feel conflicted in their emotions when the protagonists meet their ultimate fate, but this film achieves none of that, at least in my opinion. I was literally rooting for their downfall through the whole film. Honestly, how do you screw that up?! It's classic 101 storytelling.  Honestly, if you feel sorry for this family in any form during this film, you're probably a sociopath - and the fact that this film is held in such great regard is very concerning."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"Your intrest, your excitement builds in every scene. One of the best screenplay. This was my first Korean movie to watch and it stole me."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,Loved this Film from Start to End! The Parks n Kim's playing the role of Rich & Poor perfectly. Great Cast! Loved the role of up and down shots n those stairs!!! Best Film of 2019 easily
기생충,Parasite,2019,9,,"This is a must see film packed with tons of implied meaning tackling many social issues focussing on the wealth gap. However the implied message behind the movie is also matching with a complex base level story which surprises the audience with every passing moment. No I know that many people are turned off at the sight of subtitles, but I hope that if this is the only factor keeping you from watching this movie, I beg you to overlook it and enjoy this incredible cinematic experience.  I think that this movie has a really unique way of showing the gaps between the social classes that exist. I find that just like Metropolis there are several consistencies between the two, but at the base of this there is one single theme; The rich despite relying on the working class often take advantage of them. Now this movie may have gone to the extreme showing how some people just can't take the oppression and they eventually crack but I think that it was important for the filmmaker to show how social conditions set up the downtrodden to fail.  I absolutely loved how this movie developed and found myself watching it three times in a row ad each time I discovered a new feeling for the film. So that being said I gave this movie a 9/10 because I think that with every viewing there is more to take away from this film."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"I loved this movie. I was laughing almost the whole time and when I wasn't, I was holding my hand over my mouth with surprise. Every twist and turn of the story is paced and delivered. Every character is spot on.  I love a film with a message, and this one is loud and clear.  You should watch it. I don't care that it's in Korean, you should watch it."
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"PARASITE: The new Bong Joon-ho film that may be the best he's made and a hopeful contender for the best of the year.  First of, the dialogue is brilliant. With it constantly working on multiple levels, first making you understand and care about these characters, then learning dribs and drabs of their schemes and finally subtly setting up dialogue which is then brilliantly reincorporated to fuel emotional powerhouses of performances within the explosive finale. This is all whilst it being incredible natural and just out right human, there are so many instances of character inflection which tell you so much about each and every person on screen. Especially when some of the characters later in the film are playing characters themselves, lines here and there are clearly said by either themselves or the character they're pretending to be and because of their fantastic set-up, you're able to immediately tell when they're being themselves or not on the turn of a dime.  It manages to always perfectly balance it's comedic elements with the serious mystery thriller ones, always knowing exactly when and how to incorporate the two into the lives of the characters to create an amount of emotional connectivity to a film I haven't experience all year.  The political satire and themes on class struggle are too, fascinating, they're intrinsically baked into the narrative and backstory of the characters without ever being in your face or obnoxiously telling you what to think, so when they are brought up for a narrative beat or for you to get an emotional read on someone, you're free to interpret and analyse them as much or as little as you want.  Joon-Ho has at some points made the political ideologies a bit too apparent in his films which has come across as almost lecturous in Okja (2017) and Snowpiercer (2013). Thankfully this has never been detrimental to the final product, but I think the political statements within Parasite are here to create a better emotional connection to these characters, rather than blatantly tell you about the political climate you already know about.  By making you care about all these different and unique characters and using the political themes to set the stage for the story, when the themes on class struggle come to a head within the narrative you for one actually care about them because they're affecting character's you understand and like, and secondly they're then far more interesting to delve into and think about because the film never asked you too.  Even if you were to purely watch this without wanting to think about social satire, it's still an unbelievable film. It takes you on a mysterious thrill ride with some of the most interesting and unique characters put to screen this decade, the story goes to places you would never dream it would, and the soundtrack will be stuck in your head for days after you see it. It's a mile a minute masterpiece from one of the most exceptional auteur directors working today and was more than worthy of taking the Palme d'Or - 10/10"
기생충,Parasite,2019,10,,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)  Yes, I know. I'm late as hell. I don't really have anything to offer you besides my personal opinion. Theses and video essays are breaking down Parasite at such a deep level that I can't really write anything new. Nevertheless, I'll share my thoughts on it because it would be a massive miss from someone who considers himself as a film critic. I had this movie on my watchlist since last summer, but I kept delaying it, underestimating my time. So, no, I'm not just watching Parasite because it won Best Picture at the Oscars, I always planned on it.  In addition to that, yes, I also love it like most people, and no, I'm not writing this because I'm ""following the pack"". Bong Joon Ho simply delivered one of 2019's best films, and it's definitely cracking a spot in my Top10. I really enjoyed what Bong did with Okja, and I'm a massive fan of Snowpiercer. Therefore, this isn't just another South Korean flick. It's directed and co-written by someone who has been proving himself for quite some time. Even though I still defend that Sam Mendes deserved to win Best Director for his work on 1917, I'm more than happy that a foreign movie finally won Best Picture, and what a film to do it!  It can be described as a dark dramedy, but I think social satire is more adequate. The differences between the rich and the poor are beautifully shown on-screen exclusively through visuals. There's so little exposition, which is one of the reasons why Parasite has one of 2019's best screenplays. The balance between explaining something and leaving it ambiguous is perfect. Throughout the runtime, Bong Joon Ho leans on an actor's face so that the audience can understand what that character is feeling through its expressions, which will explain its actions later on.  There's a sequence that surely has been heavily discussed for the past months. It's raining, and Bong cleverly divides the screen with how the wealthy family is dealing with it against the poor neighborhood where the Kim family comes from. The gorgeous cinematography, the unforgettable musical score, the seamless editing... Everything about this sequence is technically flawless, and it carries such an emotionally powerful message. Something astonishing and beautiful to look at for some can be a horrible disaster for others.  It's a movie that balances a lot of tones. In ten minutes, the tone goes from funny to dramatic to suspenseful to scary to absolute tragedy... and it all feels incredibly realistic. That's one of my major compliments to Parasite: I never felt like it was fiction. I never thought ""this is too much, this would never occur"". Even in the third act, where the narrative takes some bold decisions, everything makes sense with what had been shown until then. From shocking character actions to surprising plot points, Bong and Han Jin-won's screenplay is excellent.  Everyone in the cast is fantastic, but Song Kang-ho is the standout, in my opinion. His role as the father of the Kim family is brilliant. I'm actually surprised he wasn't nominated for Best Actor in more award shows. I created a connection with this family in such a way that the ending truly impacted me. It's tough to deny that the writing is what makes Parasite the phenomenon that so many people fell in love with, myself included.  Technically, I don't have any defects to point out. It's one of those films that I firmly believe in having virtually no flaws. I'm in love with the score, I gasped several times at the impressive cinematography, and the editing is perfect. Whatever genre the story decides to go to, it's always entertaining and extremely captivating. Its comedy is very smart, and it made me laugh a lot of times. Its dramatic storylines kept my eyes always focused on what was happening. Even when it briefly delves into the horror territory, it's more suspenseful and scary than most of that genre's flicks nowadays.  All in all, Parasite genuinely surprised me. With so many people hyping it to a ridiculously high level, my expectations were very moderate. Nevertheless, I love it as much or more as everyone else. I know that watching it this late can make some people question my opinion/rating, but I would never love a movie because I ""should"" or because other people do. It deserves every award it received, especially the ones concerning the screenplay. It's one of the best original stories of the last few years, and it's written in such a brilliant manner, with beautiful visual storytelling instead of the overused exposition. An emotionally resonant message is present throughout the whole runtime, and the various tones are balanced seamlessly. Technically flawless: cinematography, score, editing... everything's absolutely perfect. Nothing is placed without purpose. Not a single line of dialogue is wasted. Bong Joon Ho is a phenomenal filmmaker, one that cares about the art and everything that comes with it. He truly put his heart and soul into this, and it would be a shame if anyone fails to watch this magnificent movie just because it's in a foreign language. Please, don't make such an awful mistake...  Rating: A+"
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,8,,"Unit 731 of Japanses Troops, Maruta is true DARK history of Japan that in China, Korea and Asia during WWII.

Maruta means log in Japanese, and the biological experimenters were called Maruta.  Also Flag Rising Sun used with German National's Hakenkreuz.  For that reason, the use of the Rising Sun Flag is a crime in Asian countries.

경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,6,,"For now I give it 6 stars, and though I haven't seen all the 7 episodes released so far, I'm not surprised the k-drama fans are out in force as usual to blow smoke up its backside. It's pointless to come here for a balanced review on anything k-drama because everything is ""must see"" and the ""best drama"" of the year, whatever the actual quality.  No-one does monsters quite like the Koreans and there's been a glut of shows featuring monsters and zombies in the past few years. Because of this there's some high bars to reach and overcome and there's really nothing here we haven't already seen. There's an uneasy mix of occasional comedy thrown in with the drama which might settle and gel as time goes on but in the early stages comes across as jarring.  I'll update this when I've seen the whole series, but right now I'm just here to say that if it really is as marvellous as all the 10 star reviews, I'll happily eat my hat. Until then I'm reserving judgement, despite being an admirer of the two leads. That's not enough for this to be an automatic masterpiece."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,10,,"Season 1 It's such a tragic history of Korea while Korea was colonized by Japanese for 35 years from 1910 to 1945. It was painful to watch Gyeongseong Creature cuz it's based on true history but I am sure the reality was even brutal/cruel.  The first episode of the show takes its time to build up the entire narrative, but once you let the period, the fantasy, and the premise in, you are in for a growling ride that you do not want to miss! The cinematography and director need to have mentions for 'Gyeongseong Creature'.  Strong Performances: Both Park Seo-joon and Han So-hee deliver strong performances, particularly in the action scenes.  Overall: ""Gyeongseong Creature"" Season 1 is a captivating and suspenseful K-drama that successfully blends horror, mystery, and historical elements. While it has some minor flaws, its strengths lie in its unique premise, strong performances, and engaging plot, making it a worthwhile watch for fans of the genre.  Season 2 This series should have ended with season 1. Pretty sure when this series was written it had only season one but Netflix being Netflix was like "" ok now lets make season 2"".  I personally am gonna forget that a season 2 even exists."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,9,,"I started watching this with the expectation of a thriller series about fighting a monster. But what I got is much bigger and meaningful than that. The greater monster in this series is not the said ""creature"", but the people who created it. This is a story about the oppressed and the oppressor. A story about survival in the darkest time of history. You won't find ""Stranger Things"" type of monsters in this series, but you will find a story about humanity, with a great cinematography, settings, and quality acting. It might be slow paced at first, but please continue the ride, and you will be mesmerized."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,6,,"I won't say that the series is perfect. The story has a good set up and the actors are all good. It did make me curious and I was emotional at times, empathyzing with the plight of war victims. Iam looking forward to the next season very much. However the making has I think, many flaws such as lack of detail in some characters especially like that of Wi Ha Jun's, protecting the leads with plot armours many times so that we end up thinking that's absurd, no way that's possible or that it could have been shot differently. Expected acting wise,more from both the lead actors in the first episode but I think their acting got better as the story progressed. A show that has been hyped for so long will be obviously critiqued in detail. It's interesting -both the premise and the characters but making could have been way way better.  Finished the part2 and I seriously think they could have made this an awesome show if they had invested more into the writing. Well it turned out to be an average experience for me. Do watch and find out."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,9,,"This drama is a very interesting historical drama. The historical background it portrays is based on the extremely cruel human experiments conducted in the 1940s during Japan's invasion.  Perhaps for modern-day Japanese reading this, it might not matter to them since it is not the history of atrocities they themselves committed. However, ignoring or not learning from the atrocities committed by their ancestors will never make that history disappear. I sincerely hope that the Japanese people will confront their history head-on, learn about the atrocities they committed against neighboring countries, and feel remorse for the cruel acts perpetrated by their ancestors. Please remember, ""A nation that forgets its history has no future"".  If you don't know the history of Unit 731, please watch ""The Men Behind the Sun"" from Youtube."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,7,,"Very enyojable and fun to watch but it didn't quite reach the expectations i set for it. Part 1 absolutely slayed i couldn't wait for part 2, but as much as i liked it, it felt a little dragged, like the contents from part 1 were just repeating themselves and then came the ending, that personally, doesn't make sense to me. The character development scenes felt overshadowed by the constant action scenes. Overall the show is really well made with incredilbe cast. There is potential for season .I recommend it as a watch, i'd just wished there were more laid back moments where we got to see the characters relationships grow."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,10,,"Han So-Hee didn't disappoint, again.  Experiments on humans were portrayed so good that 95% of the time I had to look away.  Characters are well-written and it's not easy to predict outcome.  Get ready for bunch of plot twists that will make your jaw drop.  On the other hand CGI was good but you can still tell that it's CGI. So that's one of the things I didn't enjoy that much. Anyway, drama is so good that I watched all 7 episodes in one breath.  Immediately after watching I came to give my rating, and I was astonished to see such low ratings. Most of the ratings are 1, and I bet those people didn't even watch the show. And I'm guessing they were given by bunch of JK girlfriends that are jealous because Han Soo-Hee starred in their boyfriend's music video.  Don't let those small ratings to keep you away from this drama, it's better than most of the dramas that are currently on the air.  NVM. 10/10 now. Wow, It just keep getting better and better."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,10,,"Had no clue about this series until a trailer appeared on YouTube and that caught my interest. Now am eagerly awaiting more episodes in January. This offers far more high quality storytelling than hoped for. Great script. Wonderful chemistry between. Han So-hee and Park Seo-joon for their intelligent complex characters with substance and depth. Really enjoy their 'fight' scenes with each other. They're a well matched couple. Appreciate the recreation of the historical context. Wonderful supporting cast/characters. And the evil humans --well they're clearly the real monsters. Crazy ""mad"" scientists are really scary in reality. Raises serious ethical questions regarding following orders, treatment of other living beings, politics, science, relationships. Visually gorgeous."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,9,,"I was really looking forward to this drama and I was not disappointed.  CGI & Effects, sceneries, sets costumes, etc..in this drama were made with quality.  I usually don't enjoy watching these period dramas about war because it is very depressing and heartbreaking to see the capacity of the brutality and cruelty of men (the japanese really caused havoc and irreparable damage to Korea).  But in this case and although there's a few very real and powerful scenes where emotions take over, thanks to the supernatural elements of the beasts and the very unique and quirky personality of Park Seo Joon's character and his romantic storyline, the darkness is somehow compensated and it works wonders.  It has been a very long time since we watched Park Seo Joon in a drama, and I missed him. I truly enjoy his acting. He has the capability of taking this character ( Jang Tae Sang) and transform, he showed us an infatuated man with all his awkwardness and clumsiness but also a man tired and in agony for what life has put him through, and you can feel all his pain, anger, frustration and then determination to keep fighting to keep surviving hell.  Han Soo Hee was fantastic too, I am used to her kicking ass with her roles and this wasn't less. She had great chemistry with Park Seo Joon and the dramatic scenes were very painful to watch. Truly amazing actress.  Rest of the cast was remarkable and I cant wait to see the second part of this. Specially Wi Ha Joon, which had a small role so far but I am anticipating he will play a much bigger part in the upcoming episodes.  Overall, amazing drama, very entertaining and well made. Go watch it!"
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,10,,"Gradually, I was sucked into the story, and in the last seven episodes, I felt sadness and anger.  The actors' acting was the best and the story development was very solid.  It was less cruel than historical facts, but it was cruel enough for viewers, so it was difficult throughout the whole time, but it was worthwhile.  There seems to be a lot of meaning about monster.  Women who were taken during the Japanese occupation were raped by the Japanese army and treated like monsters even when they returned to their hometowns after liberation.  It is seen that this monster represents such a woman.  I can't wait for Part 2."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,10,,"I am genuinely perplexed by the negative reviews because this show truly has it all. From the gripping suspense to the intense drama, fear, and love, every element is expertly woven together. Not to mention, the cast is not only incredibly talented but also stunningly gorgeous. Park Seo Joon and Han So Hee deserve immense praise for their phenomenal portrayal of their characters. Personally, this is my favorite role of PSJ, and I found myself falling in love with him over and over again. Each episode leaves you on the edge of your seat, eagerly anticipating how the story will unfold in the next installment. For me, this series is a perfect 10/10 and quite possibly the best series of 2023. I am eagerly awaiting Part 2 and cannot contain my excitement."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,6,,"Korean Drama '' Gyeongseong Creature '' is a fantasy, horror, action drama.  The historical aspect of the drama is spot on. The costumes, make-up, settings, everything are beautiful, and create the right atmosphere, along with camera filters and sharp shots.  The story has enough mystery, moreover, to keep things intense and interesting till the very ending. However, the plot is pretty basic for a fantasy historical drama, with few surprises, a messy pace when it came to the love story, which could have been omitted or kept for the second season, and poor CGI that messed up the whole momentum at times,  Other than that, there were some emotional plotlines and a lot of well handled action scenes.  Finally, the performances were all enjoyable.  So, overall, six out of ten."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,10,,"I started after seeing the critics reviews. Mostly positive though audience review was poor. Once I began, it felt like this was labeled as a wrong genre ""creature"". This should have been titled Gyeongseong 1945 or something. Because the story is character driven and I must say Park Seo Joon delivered a tremendous performance in this one. Han So Hee and so does the rest of them did their part neatly. Not high-octane was the only reason people thumbed down I guess. But if you are looking for a character driven, heavily colorful, neatly oriented and glimpse of a creature hunting down soldiers and people apart, this is a must-watch. If you want to watch something that would push your adrenaline, I would suggest going somewhere else.  The direction may seem off at first but slowly it became poised in a singular tone. The acting of Park Seo Joon keeps the drama alive till the very end. A fresh, new and charismatic look along with the new language from Joseon Era seemed to have met perfectly by the cast. 6.8 doesn't seem to do justice to the series considering the level of effort that was put into it. I would suggest anyone who is looking for a character driven story with minimum thrills to watch the series. If you are looking for only monsters and high-octane thrills, this will be disliked by you and as I can say from the rating, immensely disliked. But critics reviews were mostly positive since they are unbiased and don't have hatred in their heart. And they were also not expecting only monsters in a series. Most critics labelled it as a 'hit' rather than miss. So, watch for yourself."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,7,,"As I've been very much looking forward to this project, I must say I am somewhat indecisive as to how I should rate the first part of ""GyeongSeong Creature"". As expected from the star-studded cast, the acting is nothing to criticise. Directing and writing also holds up, except from some interesting love-moments between our protagonists being sprinkled in during high risk chases etc. The concept most irritating to me is the balance of power between creature, soldiers and heroes, as the latter seem to have way fewer problems surviving one to one combat against this military killing monster than trained, armed soldiers do. Besides that, definitely worth a watch!"
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,10,,"Didn't expect much here but was pleasantly surprised the more episodes I wateched. Acting is decent and the story developes at a reasonable clip. The cinematography provided nice visuals and while the 'monster' might appear far fetched, I do give the writers credit for an interesting twist on Japan's occupation of Korea before liberation. There are some sub-plots of survival during of the darkest times in Korea's history so you might have to dig a bit deeper to find some of these underlying messages, but overall, am enjoying it thus far. I gave it a chance and as I headed into this with an open mind, I'm being rewarded."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,8,,"Great suspense and good storyline with a historical background. The drama has some of my favourite actors in it; Han So-hee from 'My Name', Park Seo-joon who never fails to make me smile hence bringing a bit of lightness to the drama, Kim Hae-sook showing her motherly love and Wi Ha-joon from 'Squid game, Little Women and The Worst of Evil always with an air of quiet confidence that makes him very attractive! Although it all adds to the suspense I personally don't like gore and monster-like creatures but the drama does say 'horror' as part of its genres. I got round that by fast forwarding those parts .... Pretty much like I did for Game Of Thrones which is a universal hit! I'm on Episode 4 and I am still pretty much intrigued enough to keep watching."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,10,,"Didnt think i would like this probably based off its odd name but thats me, this has blown me away through 4 episodes, Never have i seen better acting throughout the entire cast, its not a who's who of Korea but everyone is on their ""A"" game.  Ive done my fair share of looking into WW2 Germany and Japan but never heard of unit 731 which is a true thing that happened and it was as bad as what the NAZI's did, this and a small amount of sci-fi which doesnt really hurt the series along with a very dynamic FL and as someone stated in a review its a MASTERPIECE.  It took the 2nd episode for it to really kick in and has built on so far please give this a try its fantastic."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,7,,"I'm sorry to say this is not a 10 in the real world. It's not a must see and quite frankly it's pretty boring. I dont need a lot of action if there is a good story with intensity and characters I care about. But I just didn't get enough of anything here. There are a lot of k drams out there with plenty of monsters and zombies, but this wasent even in the top 5 of recent offerings. Don't get me wrong, it wasent bad l, evidence by more score. But.these 10 scores are not objective at all. And the actual rating of a 7.4 at the time of my posting this is more accurate to reality. Stop the hype and keep it real please!"
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,10,,"Wow! This series is so thrilling and well made. Every scene is good.  The story has an important message about the atrocities committed by the Japanese in Korea, China etc during and before WW2. It took a K drama to bring this often brushed aside part of history to the minds of the public. Well done. Especially since some Japanese refuse to acknowledge they committed them let alone apologise for them or compensate meaningfully for their crimes against humanity. Unlike the Germans, the public stance of the Japanese government is not as remorseful as it should be. And they do not cover the crimes properly in their history books. So the new generation is generally ignorant of their country's wrong doings in the first half of the 20th century. But this isn't irrelevant today. Look at the ridiculous way the compensation for comfort women and forced labor and Fukushima water release were handled recently.  The struggle between the oppressed Koreans and the Japanese occupiers is heart breaking and meticulously shown. Even the creature has an emotional connection I have never seen in any other show about monsters. Unlike zombie movies that are inherently artificial, the horror here is factually and historically based so it feels very believable. The resistance and medical experiments are brilliantly blended into a fusion of horror, fact based WW2 atrocities, convincing romance and thrilling escape adventure. The escape parts are as knuckle biting as the best WW2 movies recalling the Great Escape, Escape from Sorbibor and Anthropoid.  There hasn't been an A list lead couple pairing like this since Crash Landing. The roles are tailor made for Han So Hee, the most convincing and versatile actress of her generation. Her action sequences are flawless. Park Seo Joon's charm is used perfectly. They have such rapport on screen. The romantic parts are cleverly blended in amongst the action. Terrific supporting cast including familiar faces like Wi Ha Joon and Kim Hae Sook.  Can't believe some people fuss about the soundtrack. Who even notices the songs at the end of an episode when so much is going on? There is some ridiculous campaign to attack this show. But the numbers speak for themselves. Top show on Netflix globally.  The most exciting and meaningful series in a long while."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,7,,"The series is set in 1945 when Korea was under Japanese rule and is set in the city of Gyeongseong. Park Seo-joon plays Jang Tae-sang the rich owner of a big pawn shop who only cares about himself. Along comes Yoon Chae- ok (Han So-hee) a sleuth who alongside her father is searching for her mother. In the city is a large military instillation where hideous experiments are carried out and create a monster. The two stars of the series through circumstances find themselves on a mission within the facility and discover the awful truth. I enjoyed the monster portrayal, the time period and the acting. Sadly as the series is mostly filmed underground or at night the gloominess of it all for me on a personal level is too much."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,10,,"I never been into this thrilling genre but after watching this I keep addicted. This series is so awesome, the filming setting and the chemistry between the cast are amazing. Really recommended! I can't wait for next episode. Really worth to watch. Han Sohee and Park Seojun chemistry make me melted. Can't wait for their next romance to blossom. Han Sohee never disappointing, she always choose best project. I always love how she maintained her emotion. She has really good acting skill. I hope someday she will filming overseas and debute in Hollywood. She could nailed every role, how multitalended she is."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,5,,"Yeah, I know the K-movies fans will love the hell out of everything produced in South Korea, even when it is a mediocre soap opera. But it is just that, a mediocre soap opera with quite a few redeeming features.  Seriously, nobody can tell me that they were not rolling their eyes every few minutes, while the main characters, attacked and under pressure to run were losing precious time to argue, gaze into each other's eyes, discuss their feelings or just cry and stand still. There is plot armour and then there is Asian plot armour, thrice as thick... Each one of them should have been dead about 5 times. The soldiers were all incredibly incompetent, felt like Storm troopers from Star Wars. And the monster itself was a killing much...unless it was facing a main character, in which case it was about as competent as the soldiers...  Again, quite a few redeeming features, which is why this is not 3/10. The main two characters are cool, the baddies are slightly exciting, some really good supporting characters (love Mrs Nawol), the premise is good, some really good action scenes, scary monster, but if I had to constantly endure long scenes of romance and sadness in the middle of battles and people wasting a minute to discuss trivial matters while running to escape, and had to suspend my disbelief time and time again, I could not enjoy it fully.  In some aspects South Korean cinema should better learn from European and American cinema, because it seems they want the crazy over-the-top drama and feelings from Bollywood instead..."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,9,,"I am a huge K-drama fan, and this drama was just wow. Based on the true history of human experience during when Japan invaded Korea, the story with added fantasy brings the sadness and excitement from the twisted plots.  The characters were very well written, and especially Seojun Park and Sohee Han bring the characters alive. I thought the CGI of the 'creatures' was good enough. Since the drama features the creatures, there's some gruesome scenes but not too much.  The main duo really intensifies the scenario and I cannot wait to watch the rest of the episodes. I hope the rest of the episodes are as fantastic as the first seven."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,10,,"Please watch this. The plot is very well written - you will not be able to keep your eyes off the screen. I watched all 7 episodes in one seating. The main characters, Han So-hee and Park Seo-jun, didn't disappoint. All other characters were only complimenting the show. This drama depicts medical experiments done on humans during the Japanese colonization of Korea. It has the CGI added, however, this is based on what really happened in the past. It's cruel and violent, but it's the fact and truth which cannot be denied and needs to be known and learned by all people. You will not regret watching this."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,7,,"Although Horror is not my favorite genre, I enjoyed this series as it really was more of an action thriller than a horror series. While the creature is central to the plot, it does not dominate, and the true horror comes from the villains that are performing the experiments that created the creature...the 1940's produced some truly evil people.  I thought the acting was very good and the action scenes very believable. I also appreciated that the blood and gore was limited to being realistic rather than over-the-top as often is done in the horror genre...NOTE: not saying there isn't much blood and gore, there is a lot at times but it always fit the situation in a realistic way.  While it existed, the romantic thread was definitely secondary to action in the first season although it became a little more prevalent in the second season. It was core to the character motivation in both seasons though. I thought the chemistry between Jang Tae-sang (Park Seo-joon) and Yoon Chae-ok (Han So-hee) was great. I especially liked glares Chae-ok gave Tae-song in the early episodes.  The second season changes things up a bit as it moves to modern times and becomes primarily and action series with very little horror (other than from the perspective of the horrible acts people in power can inflict on those they deem beneath them).  For both seasons. I thought they did a good job with pacing the story. The flashbacks and side discussions did a good job in filling in pieces of the puzzle and by the end of both seasons, you had found out most of what was actually going on...although there are a few plot holes that don't get filled.  The second season is significantly shorter than the first...perhaps half as long from a runtime perspective (7 episodes vs 10 but the 7 are much shorter in length). I wasn't thrilled with the romantic ending, but it was consistent with the rest of the story.  Overall, worth the watch."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,9,,"I love that it's so different. It starts out like a thrilling horror about some strange happening resulting in a horrific monster. But it's so much more than a horror. It unfolds so beautifully and piece by piece you begin to sort out what is going on. As you do, the character development is absolutely fantastic! This show has drama, suspense, horror, and just layer upon layer of facets upon this story. The soundtrack is great. The way it's filmed is stunning. Best of all, they throw a little romance in there as well! This show has it all! One of the best Korean shows I've seen! Can't wait for season 2!!!!!!!!"
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,7,,"Unlike several big-budget Korean series that have appeared in the wake of Squid Game, Gyeongseong Creature is admirably restrained in its narrative ambitions and never uses it's full potential.  A historical drama infused with monsters and sci-fi stuff is brought down to some extent by poor quality CGI and ineffective chemistry between the leads. The pacing could have been better. The drama has some noticeable issues but it is still effective to please us, atleast to some extent.  Director Dong-yoon makes sure that while all the characters have their own little arc, it is Gyeongseong- the region that becomes a very important character in the narrative. The K-drama isn't without its flaws. Every now and then, there are a few gaps in logic or parts of the plot that could have been explained better along with s better chemistry. But these are little things in the face of a drama that has used its solid production value to offer something out of the box, although it doesn't stand out completely.  My Rating : 7.5/10."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,10,,"Wow, wow, and again, WOW! This series is amazing! Am only half-way, but am really enjoying what I'm getting served. The actors are great, the sets are great, the story is awesome, and yeah, sometimes there's a low-poly 3D model that seems to sit in the set somewhere with hardly any texture on it, but hey, hardly anyone would notice this. Many shots are just so well made, cinematographically, that it makes you wonder why Hollycrap can't do this anymore. The series to me seems a blend of ""Stranger Things"" meets ""Elfen Lied"" meets art-deco. Anyways, two thumbs up here, as I'm also learning something about the relation between Korea and Japan, that honestly, being originally from Europe, I knew nothing about, but made me poke my nose in the history books. Again, my appreciation and respect for the whole team that sits behind this production, please make more of this, as it's top-notch quality."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,6,,"Starts off fun and interesting and feels a little fresh and compelling and then around episode 5 gets bogged down a bit. I found my self switching to 1.25 speed for a few parts that just didn't add much to the story and seemed to drone on for no reason. There's also quite a bit of ""now why on earth would they do that"" in the middle as well as some plot armor.  All in all it is fun and an enjoyable premise. If you enjoy this type of show generally - zombie / monster / drama / action (little residents evilish at points) then it's a good plane ride watch. Some good little twists and tie together too even if a little telegraphed of forced."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,8,,"First of all, simply WOW, I'm a great fan of Korean film and TV. How is it that they keep regularly rolling out some of the most talented and gorgeous women on this planet! Han So-Hee is superb. What can one say about Soo-Hyun! The cinematography is impeccable. Park Seo-Jun is also excellent as. Jang Tae-Sang. Choi Young-Joon and Hyun Bong-Sik are so perfectly evil.  The ""Creature"" is terrifyingly destructive and lethal. We learn of its creation and horrific human experimentation hidden in Onseong Hospital by the Japanese Military trying to develop a occupying Korea in 1945.  Note the early reference to Unit 731 during scenes in the Manchuria hospital, The US bombed Hiroshima on August 6, and Nagasaki on August 9. Japan offered its surrender on August 10. Cherry blossoms normally fall by the end of May, so I think the film takes place only little more than two months before Japan's surrender.  It seems the referenced experiments were looking for a decisive weapon to use in world war 2. That whole setting is important. I had for years suggested to Netflix that they consider expanding their Korean content. I still want to see them include Guardian and Descendants of the Sun.  I think they made the right choice and will hit it big with their new focus.  After watching the second season, I decided to add this. First, there are obviously a lot of Korean drama haters in this review thread. You can discount all of them. Korean drama is far better than any of the usual Hollywood formula garbage. You will always find much deeper treatment of life experiences in Korean dramas. I'd put them up against the top Hollywood offerings any day. The links to relevant issues the world is facing today are all over this series. I could clip and cite passages from all along the episodes. In the scene in Season 2, Episode 5, when Lady Maedea meets Master Jang, she refers to the ""terrorist attack"" he committed at Ongseong Hospital. He responds to her ""We call it resistance."" Go back and watch Season 1 carefully. I don't want to get into any political or social debates, but the historical and current allusions are extensive. Many don't like to be prodded into thinking. They just want the entertainment, usual Hollywood gratuitous violence and sex recipes provide. That's OK. If you're that kind of audience, Korean drama is not for you. I understand. I can enjoy Keanu, Cruise, and Marvel productions, too. Long ago, I tried watching subtitled foreign. TV and films: Fellini, Bergman, Truffaut, Delouch, and others. I discovered and highly enjoyed Bollywood productions, then about a decade ago I stumbled onto the Korean treasures.  This film is very well written, directed, and acted. It deserves the praise and high ratings it is getting. Han So-hee is an excellent young star. You will see her in a lot more great performances. Park Seo-joon has already proven himself a top notch actor. I was right when I highly recommended to Netflix to carry a lot more of the Korean content over ten years ago. They did. That move, I'm sure not only on my humble nobody suggestion, worked out very well for them. This one will go on my Netflix list of favorites. Don't leave it off your lists. You won't regret it."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,7,,"T Do not ask me about CGI and what not or ""horror"" to belittle Netflix Korean production. I admit i came to watch shows more into police/political intrigues like Stranger and developped a taste. This show avoids more than most some clichés/tropes all too often present in contemporary settings that make a Westerner's stomach turn, namely the oversweetness, constant groveling/ bullying and all around hypocrisy/resignation are absent thanks to WWII, that's a relief.  The background is just fantastic and the plot is a McGuffin. A pretext, motivation for all to follow. The whole interest is how humans deal when the going gets tough. After decades of colonisation, the well oiled machine went awry with WWII. We all know or should know some of the atrocities committed by ""doctors"" in some camps under the German rule. Those camps, some of them, what little remains are visited today and it is sickening. Perfect place for a nightmare indeed. Japan doesn't have anyone to round up. Except for the people they already oppress, so it's done rather quietly. Hence the mystery of the disappeared people our heroes go looking for.  The whole societal tissue is ""dissected""(sorry) layer by layer, the dynamic slowly reveals itself and the pressure rises. The balance of power is unstable, the agreements, the people you know aren't to be trusted in general, yet some tenuous links are strong. But which ? That's freaking awesome ! Like the best spy-game. All plots and plans, refined as they may be, may fall on your ears. At this point, it's YOUR head on the block, you're committed. Well, I was.  The creature and such, yes, it's overkill. Suits young people just fine. Suits the plot too, she's a very helpful creature when soldiers cross path with her. We're all good for something in this world, mad scientists excluded..Too bad the series is poorly paced and the villain obvious after a few episodes only. The story behind the villain is unresolved.  Edit : season 2 is ""full"" of abnormals in our time. It didn't work for me. Watchable especially if you doze off. But not good. Zero charm to begin with and no James Cameron/Alien trick to make me care."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,10,,"The show is about how different people cope with wartime occupation. You've got an active resistance, collaborators, profiteers and those just trying to survive. (Think German occupied France in WWII). But in this case it takes place in Seoul 5 months before Japan surrenders. The Japanese are the bad guys here, but not all of the citizens of in Seoul are blemish-free.. Jang Tae-sang (Park Seo-joon) is a playboy who owns a high-class pawn shop, avoids those in the Koreans resistance and makes sure the Japanese authorities are kept happy. His carefree life begins to unravel when the police chief demands he find his missing girlfriend, and two strangers wander into town with a proposal of their own.  Yes, there is eventually a monster, and it's convincingly depicted, but really this show (the first 7 episodes anyway; Part 2 shows up in January) is about seeing what war makes people into, and how the right people can make those around them better.  Han So-hee proves she is the best ass-kicking, emotionally convincing, gorgeous actress around. Park Seo-join gives his best perforance since Itaewon Class. The ubiquitous Kim Hae-sook, as Jang Tae-sang's unofficial step mom, is excellent, as always. Everyone is wonderful, including all the side actors. The sets look real. The effects look real. The brutal violence is hard-to-watch real. The writing is excellent. Oh, and the creature is pretty cool."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,9,,"Gyeongseong creature is an amazing series if you love this genre. I thought the drama would only focus on its seriousness but turns out to have some comedy and humor in it which portrayed it beautifully.  (Park Seo Joon) nailed his role again and (Han So Hee) character was well written and I really love her action and her express of emotion which she delivered maturely in every scene. This two actors chemistry was beautiful even they didn't have so many lovey dovey scenes as the main focus was thrilled. But the romance is still there and it's beautiful and cute!  Overall, the cinematography, the background, the soundtrack, the music, the emotion, the plot, the cast and everything are marvelous. Get your popcorn and get ready for a thrilling and scary adventure!  Gyeongseong creature."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,6,,"Gyeongseong Creature is a creative twist on the horror genre. It's a period piece with monsters, some rom-com, and a captivating story with a unique plot that keeps the audience guessing. The cast delivers a mostly strong performance, however, there is a noticeable lack of chemistry between Park Seo-joon's and Han So-hee's characters. This could have been improved with a better build up before the romance was introduced. Instead the story tried to push an immediate love that de-valued the arc of both characters. Also, the beginning two episodes were a bit slow, but the series is still worth watching. Overall, this is a good series with several jump scares, dynamic action, and a clever story line."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,10,,"What's going on here? Season 1 was already really good, I was excited for Season 2 to come out, and it completely blew me away. I've only seen the first 3 (of 7) episodes, but I think I've rarely seen a series use its first season as such an exciting springboard.  In terms of production, this isn't just peak Korean cinema, it's peak cinema in general. It even surpasses some of what you see in Hollywood blockbusters. The choreography and lighting are truly impressive, and the soundtrack stands out positively.  I'd recommend avoiding any trailers for Season 2, because there's a huge surprise! :)"
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,10,,"I didn't understand why they took 2 years to film and they even filmed both seasons at the same time around but after watching the series, the wait really paid off.  First of all, let's talk about the casts. They have Han Sohee, Park Seojoon, and Wi Hajoon. All of them portrayed the characters perfectly especially Han Sohee, her eyes are just.. sad. You wouldn't help but being all sad with her. She doesn't have to say anything for us to feel the pain that the character is going through. Park Seojoon is doing well as usual, and Wi Hajoon, there's something about his acting like whatever role he's given. He just devoured hard. And it makes us much more intrigued with the storyline. You guys have to watch it."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,10,,"This show has the most truthful history of how Japan performed holocaust against Koreans. This Cruelty and brutality of Japanese at the time was not less than Hitler's actions. The actors are flawless in their acting. The set is amazing. Beautiful set where is shows buildings, rooms, and decor is just amazing. Lighting and directing definitely is on the point. Han so hee's basically lived the character and Park seo joon's tone and acting is just speechless. I can see how they really focused on every aspect of the production. Actors who plays Japanese soldiers are on the point as well. Their tone is real and their facial expressions are exactly what is needed."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,10,,"Just finished season 2, first thing i wanna say is that PSJ's acting peaked in this show, there were many scenes where i was saying to myself that no other kdrama actor can match his skills and talent of acting, I can say Devil works hard but PSJ works harder What an amazing actor he is  Now come to the storyline, The show has engaging storyline and also the action scenes were topnotch, But it ended with a tease of separation, i really wanted them (ML & FL) to be together at the end but they left us with the possibility of third season and didn't bring back the couple together completely, But i am happy that both ML and FL survived at the end, It was neither sad nor a happy ending, Maybe we have to wait for another season to see them together happily."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,8,,"It's a K-Drama made with a mixture between reality & fiction with entertainment in mind. However some military & scientific scholars here are trying to explain how bolt-action rifles work and what not all while completely missing out on the outstanding storytelling, visual & dramatization aspect of this series.  This drama perfectly outlines the historical events, the pain & suffering endured by people back in WW2, be it Korean, Japanese or anybody. Sub-plots in this series are excellent and short-lived as timely accurate with the progression of the plot.  Rest of the episodes are yet to air and some are frantically drawing conclusion for some upvotes while flaming K-Drama fans. Seriously what were you expecting?"

And park soe was great too ,every character was well explained and perfect.  Can't wait to see season 2,tough not many days left for it."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,5,,"I started Gyeongseong Creature intrigued by the glowing reviews, but the series ultimately left me disappointed. After a promising start, I found myself fast-forwarding through the final two episodes - a sign that it failed to hold my attention.  While the cinematography is beautiful, with a well-crafted 1945 setting and solid CGI, the storytelling lacks consistency and direction. It's unclear whether the show wants to confront historical atrocities using a monster as a metaphor, or focus on the brutalities themselves. As a result, it doesn't fully commit to either path.  The tension wavers between moments of suspense and stretches of boredom, as development is foreseeable. There are major plot holes - like all gunfire suddenly stopping for a lengthy ""hero speech"" in the middle of a battle - that break any immersion the show manages to build. Several eye-rolling moments undercut the stakes just when the suspense begins to work.  The romance is flat and underdeveloped, more of a checkbox than a believable emotional arc. It feels like the writers couldn't decide what kind of story they wanted to tell - monster horror, historical drama, or tragic romance - and so the series ends up doing none of them particularly well.  A more coherent arc could've focused first on the human experimentation that gives rise to the monster, leading to a revenge-driven alliance with the resistance movement. That kind of structure might have given the show real emotional and narrative weight.  Verdict: Stylish and full of potential, but let down by weak writing, lack of focus, and too many narrative missteps. Disappointing."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,10,,"Great series, great creativity and great acting from Park Seo Joon and Baek Hyun Sung.  Does anyone know if it will be a season 3?  Is it true season 2 has only 7 episodes?  Everything in this series keeps the suspense and makes you think about what is going to happen next. The action scenes in this series are very good.  Season 2 feels like there will be a continuation for this series.  I think it should be appreciated, there was alot of hard work done for this series. Great job to all those involved to create this drama. Hope to see another one soon with these talented and amazing actors. Thx."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,10,,"Gyeongseong creature is an amazing series if you love this genre. I thought the drama would only focus on its seriousness but turns out to have some comedy and humor in it which portrayed it beautifully.  (Park Seo Joon) nailed his role again and (Han So Hee) character was well written and I really love her action and her express of emotion which she delivered maturely in every scene. This two actors chemistry was beautiful even they didn't have so many lovey dovey scenes as the main focus was thrilled. But the romance is still there and it's beautiful and cute!  Overall, the cinematography, the background, the soundtrack, the music, the emotion, the plot, the cast and everything are marvelous. Get your popcorn and get ready for a thrilling and scary adventure!  Can't wait for season 2 and see where it ends."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,10,,"Amazing drama with superb action. Their chemistry, the action, the plot everything is Amazing. For the suspense & horror genre viewers I suggest you to watch both seasons. I bet you won't disappoint. But I'm bit disappointed for the ending. The post creadit scene is just like a cliffhanger. I hope the netflix renew for season 3 like sweet home. The masterpiece need the season 3. Eagerly waiting for season 3. The drama's season 1 is revolve around the colonial period of korea how japanese army was experimenting on the korean people but the season 2 was setup on the modern seoul. I just hope that they bring season 3."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,9,,"First of all, if we want to classify this film's genre...it's really difficult to pin down: It has elements of Action, Drama, Suspense, Horror, Sci-Fi, and Romance in heavy doses.  Loosely (VERY loosely) based on the activities of the Japanese Biological Research Unit 731 in China during World War 2; this story takes place in Gyeonseong (Seoul), Korea, toward the end of the war. But here we have a group of evil scientists and soldiers (a little too much like Unit 731) under them doing insane experiments on the political undesirables of the city, in the basement of the hospital.  Into this background we have a host of fascinating characters and sub-plots interweaved. Korean films and series are something else. The production values I've seen in Korean films and series since 2001 are just stellar. If you love this series, just like I did, my next suggestion would be to watch ""Kingdom,"" also on Netflix."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,3,,"I give this snorfest a 3 just for some good creature action and for some action violent scene!  The rest? I was barely hold it to watch the first episode with all the talking and mambo jambos blah blah blah!  This show is so boring and without the creature, it will be the most boring and overrated korean series i watched!  Much much much dialogue with no sense, no chemistry between the characters.. stupid decisions, unrealistic plot armor for some... 95% talking and unconvincing drama and 5% action and horror. HOW PEOPLE GIVES THIS 10/10 is weird!!  Don't listen to these 10/10 reviewers. This show is depressing boring..if you don't trust me, watch the first episode and you will want to skip and skip to see if something happens. Definitely not recommended it."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,10,,"A love story in a history lesson. Or a history lesson in a love story. Either way, it works. There are some slow bits which left me shouting at the telly, but overall it is a good watch. Also, while I was aware (as a graduate of Japanese history), of biological/germ warfare research conducted by the Japanese, I had not appreciated the scale of it until I revisited the subject while watching this series. We have grown up (in the West) with stories of the holocaust in Europe, but this is the first time I have seen portrayal in popular culture of atrocities in Asia which affected Asians. I recommend you watch it."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,10,,"I would say this is a must watch can't deny that the casting cinematography plot story star cast everything is lit I would say the second season was at par to first season but still first one was better but both are good.  Han so hee did something out of her league but it wasn't suprising as she proved her talent in the first season and same as in second season.park seo joon was lit as always he showcased his talent like always.  The show masterfully balances action, emotional depth, and horror. The historical context adds a layer of gravity, making the supernatural threat feel even more terrifying as it mirrors the real-life oppression and struggle the characters face.  If you're a fan of historical dramas with a supernatural twist, Gyeonseong Creature is a must-watch. It's a dark, thrilling, and emotionally charged series that will leave you craving more by the time the credits roll."

I put this on as background noise while I played on my phone and before I knew it I had put my phone down and was completely immersed in this show!

경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,10,,"I just finished watching a series that stars my favorite actors, Park Seo Jun and Han So Hee. What drew me in was the historical setting at the start, and I was blown away by the emotions conveyed by the cast and their incredible chemistry despite having limited screen time together. Netflix once again delivered with outstanding screenplay and cinematography. Season 2 was absolutely worth the wait, taking me through a whirlwind of emotions. However, as a devoted fan, I'm deeply saddened by the ending. Tae-sang's unwavering love for Chae-Ok is truly admirable; they were like beacons of light for each other in the midst of turmoil. The moment when the female lead tearfully expressed, ""I still have so many things I wanted to tell you,"" left me in tears. While it would have been wonderful to see a sweet dating period for them, Jang Tae Sang chose to let the love of his life live an ordinary life and carry on with both the pain and the memories. This has left an indelible mark on me, and I don't think I'll ever fully recover from the emotional impact of this series."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,3,,"Yes once again a show hampered by a lack of editing of script and actual footage. I reckon at least two whole episodes worth of material could have been cut from this.  Episode after episode seems to have the main characters hiding in broom cupboards and storerooms for hours on end. It almost feels like real time.  They make a break and run...into another closet for another whole episode, that or clamber though massive airducts that are that size I'm sure for something much larger then a human...  Tedious. It's a shame as the idea and looks of the show are really great but it feels like they decided to use every single scene shot and didnt think to edit it down to improve the glacial pacing."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,10,,"Firstly this show is spectacular. Acting, pacing, costumes makeup, writing. I even like how the towns almost its own character too. Seriously I cannot say a bad word against this show.  I've been saying this for ages and I'm gonna keep on saying it. If you want consistently well written good made shows and films just go Korean.  Netflix has a lot of bright moments good shows and good films like Extraction 1 and 2, The Highwaymen, The Tiger King and Making a Murderer and tons of shows and films I'm missing oh yeah Dalhmer was fantastic too.  But then unfortunately one thing we don't get with Netflix is consistency we get an amazing show in Narcos easily a 10/10 from me. Engrossing, engaging the type of show where ur like one more episode and then relaize your gonna have 4 hours of sleep for work. But then whereas you get the amazing show that is Narcos then you have the same creators make Griselsda like really you make Narcos gritty, hard hitting, vicious and clever in its writing and then you have one of the worst gangsters/crime Lords in history seriously in real life this women out some of the men to shame. Why not go the Narcos route and give us a true account of just how vicious and evil this women truly was na we'll just gloss all over that and make her into a female icon pftt yea nice one Netflix.  Then we have our documentaries and again this is something that Netflix is known for and has some amazing examples like the David Attenborough narrated wildlife docs to some of the true crime docs again excellent and again then we have new dumb docuseries which are literally trying to rewrite history. Alexander the making of a god oh and don't forget the Cleopatra fiasco that actually caused a real diplomatic incident seeing as the Egyptians are quite proud of their heritage and theirb history.  What Netflix have against the Egyptians I don't know but again for every 1 or 2 good shows or films we get 3 or 4 that are guff and yes I am fully aware that taste is subjective what I enjoy in a film or show may not be to everyone's taste which is why we have a wide range if films but not documentaries.  Documentaries are supposed to be based in fact not someone's opinion. Not how someone feels. But facts and facts do not lie. The irony here is that the dalhmer show actually had more factual references in it than most of these so-called made up documentaries and dalhmer was a tv show.  Seriously Netlfix what are you doin? Anyway like I said at the start of this review you consistently want good films and shows go Korean whether its films like train to busan, parasite or the wailing or shows like Kingdom, All of us are dead, this show here all these shows and films are 9's or 10's everything's on point anyway u want consistently good entertainment go Korean or just wait for the next film or show to come out and do what the rest of us do.  Come on here check out the user reviews and see if it's good.  Anyway enjoy your entertainment however u like it but if enjoy good writing, carefully created characters that you can become invested in the just watch Korean entertainment.  Oh and one last thing this show was trully awesome."

경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,10,,"One of the strongest female Action hero on the planet.  Han So-hee's Acting in Gyeongseong Creature Seasons 1 and 2  Han So-hee's portrayal of Yoon Chae-ok in Netflix's Gyeongseong Creature has captivated audiences with its emotional depth and physical intensity. Across both seasons, she skillfully brings to life a character marked by resilience, vulnerability, and complexity, proving her versatility as a leading actress in Korean drama.  Season 1: Emotional Impact and Physicality  Set in 1945 Gyeongseong under Japanese occupation, Han introduces Yoon Chae-ok as a tough and resourceful individual adept at surviving in a hostile world. Her performance strikes a balance between strength and emotional nuance, particularly in scenes exploring her longing for her lost mother. The intensity of her action sequences, which include hand-to-hand combat and daring stunts, showcases her commitment to the role and her ability to handle physically demanding scenes. Han's ability to ground her character in genuine emotion ensures that viewers connect with Chae-ok's personal struggles.  Season 2: Evolution and Depth  Season 2, set decades later, reveals a more complex side of Yoon Chae-ok, who now bears the weight of immortality. Han excels in portraying a character grappling with isolation and existential questions, adding layers of maturity and gravitas. Her chemistry with Park Seo-joon, who plays Jang Ho-jae, enriches the narrative, blending tension and emotional depth into their evolving relationship. Despite criticism of the second season's pacing and narrative focus, Han's consistent performance remains a highlight.  In summary, Han So-hee's performance in Gyeongseong Creature stands as a testament to her talent and dedication. She imbues Yoon Chae-ok with emotional richness and physicality, solidifying her place as one of the most compelling actresses in contemporary Korean drama."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,8,,"Gyeongseong Creature: Gyeongseong (the old name for Seoul) March 1945, the 36th year of the Japanese occupation of Korea, Rebels are savagely suppressed. Jang Tae-sang (Park Seo-joon) appears generally indifferent to what is going on, he owns the biggest pawn shop in Gyeongseong, rubs an information network he's generally a bit like Rick from Casablanca. But his idyllic life comes under threat when the mistress of the Japanese chief of police goes missing, unless Jang finds her his business will be seized, Jang links up with a Manchurian woman, Yoon Chae-ok (Han So-hee) who specialises in finding missing people. Her skills are renowned but her one failure is to find her mother who disappeared ten years ago. To make things even more interesting a Japanese Military Scientific unit is in town and is carrying out biological experiments on prisoners and abducted Koreans. While this story is also about the developing affection between Jang and Yoon the series has a very dark tone, only the vein of (sometimes slap-stick) humour which runs through it leavens the mood a little. Korean citizens are treated with extreme brutality by the Japanese, they are not part of a Co-Prosperity Sphere, they are very much second class citizens, Even the more mundane experiments have horrific effects on the victims. The gradual creation of the main monster unfolds in frightening detail. Much slaughter and bloodletting ensues. A story of rescue attempts, rebellion, horror, romance and science fiction with a few plot twists and surprises, usually unveiled through flashbacks. Directed by Chung Dong-yoon and Roh Young-sub, Written by Kang Eun-kyung. Ten episodes on Netflix, 8/10."

The way it constantly surprised and scared me was mind-blowing. I couldn't help but go through a rollercoaster of emotions - I laughed, cried, and cried some more! I found myself screaming, cheering, and even shouting at the characters, urging them to run for their lives! It's hands down the best show I've seen in a long time, and I highly recommend it to everyone! The intensity of the show kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. It's a must-watch for anyone seeking an exhilarating and unforgettable viewing experience!"
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,8,,"When I started watching it and I was practically blown away: really good acting, great story, likable main characters, phenomenal settings and atmosphere, and prettz well-made special effects.  Surprisingly, the day it was released, when I checked on IMDB, it had only a 6.5 rating... I just wonder why.  I have seen some reviewers described it as a drama but I went through the first 7 episodes it turned out to be more of a survival horror series with several seocondary themes. There was definitely a dramatic element but there was also a marked feel-good element to balance it out.  Anzway, this series is much more than just a drama; in fact, up to a point, it was many genres flawlessly merged together: it is definitely the old Resident Evil games meeting a mix of a WWII epic drama, with romantic 1940s noir elements thrown into it as well as a hint of Casablanca! All perfectly shaken into unique cocktail of enjoyably explosive entertainment.  This is what I thought after watching the first 7 episodes at the end of December 2023. I got mixed feelings about the last three episodes. They start in a very dynamic way as the plot unfolds but they are also very repetive and the ending is definitely overdone, the plot getting erratic. It went from survival horror with a romance to a farftetched fantasy movie. It felt as if they added nonsensical developments just to have a 1-hour 10th episode.  Overall, I still recommend the series. There are a lot of good elements: it is well done, captivating, and it gets better for several episode. The ending though is a little too far-fetched. I adjusted the rating accordingly."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,10,,"Another fantastic Korean production. The first thing that surprises is the great capacity for setting that they have developed in the Korean industry, recreating past eras, without effects, or if there are any, they are not noticeable. The setting is perfect, of absolute good taste, transporting you to another time, to a distant place that will never exist again.  Another key part is the actors, all brilliant, especially Han So-hee, who is simply adorable, absolutely nothing to do with the classic sexualized female protagonist that TV has accustomed us to. No, she is a sad and vulnerable but full of life, precious. It is impossible not to fall in love with her.  The story is entertaining, agile, and recreates a world that is half real and half imaginary. Safety pin."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,10,,"Really enjoyed this from the first season last year. Just finished watching Season 2, which came out today (27/09/24). Action, horror, suspense, stellar acting, this show was truly thrilling to watch. Although the gore really did 'gore', I couldn't help but suck it up and stay glued to the episodes unfolding. The bonus scene after the credits of the final episode was unexpected and had me salivating at the thought of a third season and the Male and Female leads (Park Seo Joon and Han So Hee) will be back again - their chemistry and interplay of their characters is purely wonderful to watch! I'm taken aback by how spellbound I was as I write this! This show was so gripping that I completed the season in less than one day. I've watched many Korean dramas but never seven episodes in one day - Gyeongseong Creature is just that good! I hope, and I'm keeping everything crossed, that there'll be a season 3! We deserve a season 3! 10/10 would definitely recommend, especially if you enjoy complex characters, well crafted character interplay and phenomenal acting, and a well-executed story."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,2,,"What started as an interesting take on the horrors of the Japanese occupation of Joseon nee Korea was captivating. The set production was amazing, the emotions ran a little too high but was as sincere as possible.given the subject matter. And yet, the monster was over the top ridiculous, the music sentimental & trite, the over-head lighting was too much and the plot just went as expected. We were liked the first several presides and was glued to the tv, but towards the end it was just washed out and I didn't really care about the characters except the older woman amd man who worked in the pawnshop: they were great! One could look at rhis show and say there was a lot of hatred towards the Japanese and it's understandable given the horror they wrought but the script did alllow for a few redeeming Japanese. Again, the metaphorical element of the show was brilliant and the Montserrat was symbolic of the hell that was wrought by Japan was searing. Otherwise, I def won't watch a second season."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,10,,"Kudos to all that made the show possible. It's really a brilliant piece of Korean art as far as I'm concerned and a perfect intro to their work. It's a subtle mix of horror, romance, politics, morality and purpose. The two lead pair are just incredible artists and so is the rest of the crew. 'Gyeongseong Creature' is so well put together in this weird and challenging niche genre they picked it has quickly become a favorite of mine.  Thankfully I saw this is the native language as I know better from my anime days. In my experience low quality dubbing often seems childish and somewhat jarring and this could be why some people have rated it so low.  In its essence though this is a show about what it means to be human and hence necessarily free. Someone else here described it nicely by saying that this is a show told in metaphors and I agree. If you remove the ""Creature"" and replace it anything else that is the hideous result of a heartless world then this is will only remove the fantasy aspect of the show and it wouldn't even matter. This would still be a must watch and I can't wait for the next season!"
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,10,,"Unfortunately for human race, there were way below ""human standards"" creatures. Like nazis, and some japanese imperialist dudes (Unit 731 is a nefarious example, for japanese), who did all kind of experiments on humans. I do hate them equally (sue me, if you don't agree with it). Fortunately, at least nazis paid for their crimes. Unfortunately, japanese subhumans did not. Americans granted them amnesty for sharing the result of their research, as everyone knows.  This movie has a beautiful story about those bitter times. I enjoyed the movie because the two main characters are played by two of my main favourite Korean actors, who played flawlessly again their parts. I guess that the movie is making the world, by amazing metaphors, aware of some dark history. Kudos to the producers!  I want to add: kudos to Japanese netizens as well, whose reaction to the truth about unit 731 was the right one! Now,that is amazing!"
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,8,,"If you're here for jump scares and relentless monster action, ""Gyeongseong Creature"" might not be what you expect-although, trust me, you'll still get your creature fix! Set in 1945 Gyeongseong, the show blends history, horror, romance, and some top-notch awkward flirtations (because what's monster hunting without a side of clumsy love?).  Park Seo-Joon's portrayal of Jang Tae-sang is chef's kiss-he's a man who somehow balances being a tough, world-weary survivor and a lovestruck puppy who gets flustered in high-speed chases. Yeah, that happens. Meanwhile, Han So-Hee absolutely kicks butt (no surprise if you've seen her other work). She's fierce, but there's also a vulnerability that makes her character Yoon Chae-ok compelling to watch. I mean, if I had her agility, I'd be fighting monsters too... maybe.  The plot? It's solid-monsters born from human greed (classic), historical setting (because who doesn't love some old-school evil?), and the Japanese occupation as the backdrop. The show serves up a mix of action and mystery with a sprinkling of ""Wait, they're flirting now?!"" during a life-threatening chase scene.  However, the CGI sometimes feels a bit... retro, let's say. There are moments when the creature clashes with the otherwise beautifully shot setting, but it didn't stop me from enjoying the ride. And heads up, the ending is a bit of a cliffhanger that leaves you squinting at the screen saying, ""Wait, what? That's it?"" But hey, there's hope for Season 2, right?  If you're into strong character development, intriguing historical twists, and don't mind a monster or two thrown in, give this show a go. But maybe brace yourself for some unexpected romance moments while someone's probably being chased by a terrifying creature.  Final thought: it's not all high-octane thrills, but it's got heart, some awkward charm, and definitely deserves a watch!"
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,8,,"Wow, what a stellar cast and high quality production! This is a WWII era horror series set in Korea during the last days of Japanese occupation just before the home island of Japan was bombed into submission. (What Korean and Chinese people suffered at the hands of vicious Japanese occupiers should never be forgotten.)  Just as Indiana Jones movies refer to the actual Nazi search for mystical sources of power, this series presents a similar, obscene drive to develop monsters to set loose upon enemies and damn the consequences to the world. The experimentation takes place at a Japanese-run hospital and the results of their trials and errors end up dead and eaten, dead and burned or mutated into ungovernable violent monsters hangry for human brains. The hubris of the Japanese scientists has the unsurprising result of veeeeery splattery mayhem.  The cast is excellent, recognizable to fans of kdramas and the leads demonstrate impressive fight confidence. Park Seo-joon has filled out and is a movie star at every turn. His character has the moral flexibility of Rick in Casablanca, with similar panache thanks to the actor's portrayal. Han So hee, a female sleuth for hire, is swashbuckling as a fighter and spy.  The story is fairly straightforward with an about-to-retreat Japanese commander extorting Park's character, Jang Tae-sang, to help find his pregnant Korean mistress to take home with his not-so-pleased noble wife (who had the wench spirited off to the hospital unbeknownst to her spouse). In this time of chaos, many of the characters desperately seek loved ones who've gone silent or disappeared.  Obviously, this is a polarizing kdrama given the extremes of opinion.  As for the adamantly negative, finger-wagging reviews that dismiss other people's enjoyment, understand that the positive reviews are probably not biased, idiotic fans' defending their favs but folks like me who take it for what it is. Meanwhile, the negative reviews are not the result of discerning geniuses uniquely equipped to judge what constitutes worthwhile entertainment nor are the faults these reviews mention unfounded. The story does involve action movie tropes that beggar the imagination, but This is an action movie series more than a horror movie. To each his own."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,3,,"""Gyeongseong Creature"" falls short of expectations set by the director's previous success in ""It's Okay Not to Be Okay."" The movie's poor script presents protagonists in consistently advantageous yet unbelievable situations, disconnecting viewers from the narrative.  Character development is a significant flaw, with poorly developed characters exhibiting conflicting behaviors. This lack of depth leaves the film feeling shallow and fails to engage the audience emotionally.  Despite commendable performances by Park Seo-joon and Han So-hee, their chemistry is lacking, further contributing to the overall disappointment. While ""Gyeongseong Creature"" may have its moments, it pales in comparison to the director's previous work, lacking the storytelling finesse and emotional depth that viewers might expect.  -- Only great thing about this is the nice costumes and lighting."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,10,,"The story is magnificent specially in season 1, historical scenes are amazing. And what a couple of actors, Han Seo Hee and Seo Jun are insane. They must work together a lot. But honestly the end of season 2 killed me, I mean it was unexpected end. I thought Tai Sang and Chai Ok will end up together and she will still remember Tai Sang , So I was really disappointed as I was looking forward to happy ending more than this ending. Now, I think we all need season 3 with a good end this time. We all want to see Tai Sang and Chai Ok together again.  If there is another season, it's gonna be a Great one."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,10,,"Very amazing Korean Drama..I love it so much and can't wait for the Season 2  Great casts, interesting storyline, beautiful setting. I've been waiting for a long time to watch Park Seo jun in drama and once again he proves that he can portrait the character very well. His acting is so awesome.  I love the chemistry between PSJ and Han so Hee too.  The supporting casts also superb..This drama can make me angry, sad and happy..I really want to know what will happen in the next season  Season 2 will extend its narrative to Seoul in 2024..It makes me even more curious.. Fighting Gyeongseong Creature."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,8,,"Absolutely chilling and intense creature scenes that will leave you jaw dropped. Its something seen a billion times before but GSC just delivers those scenes so much better, so props to the filming crew/writing/scene development  Great acting the main leads, supporting cast, antagonist group.  Fantastic world building of the Japanese-occupied Korea in 1945.  Refreshing approach of periodic + sci-fi + romance + monster If you like Kingdom you probably will like GSC's approach to this long-saturated and stale genre thanks to low quality western shows. Looking at you Godzilla  Haunting opening credits, 10/10 idea to blend the creature's backstory into it  Mix of Japanese and old dialect Korean was surprising, but all the actors were very fluent ______  Some downsides, ridiculous plot armor takes away the show quality, and a pretty bad finale episode that had so many things didnt make sense. Other than that, the episodes without those elements present were a 9 or 10 out of 10 to watch."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,8,,"Recently, in Korean TV and Cinema they made a lot of sequels or follow-up seasons that were really, really bad.  Like The Witch 2, Sweet Home seasons 2 and 3, The Good Detective season 2 and so on.  The second season of The Gyeongseong Creature is a pleasant exception.  The first season was boring, because the story was only good for a mini-series but they stretched it to 10 episodes, which ruined it completely.  The second season has only seven episodes, it is very fast paced, does not repeat itself and you always want to know what happens next.  It shines where the first season failed.  You don't even have to watch the boring first season you can jump right in and start with the second season.  The new season plays about 80 years later than the first one and I promise you it won't bore you to death like the first one.  I am glad I gave it a try."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,8,,"I started this series with pretty much low expectations - I thought it was ""just another entertaining show for the weekend"", but good lord it proved me wrong.  The tense was growing on each episode and emotions were strong and deep, acting was superb!  By the end of the 1st season I was so, so excited to watch the 2nd one - which within the very first few minutes had me gasping, by taking the story on a whole new level.  BUT.  I felt like the makers wanted to get rid of this. I felt like the series didn't know how to identify itself, if that makes any sense...  Was it a thriller? Was it a horror? Was it a dystopia? Was it action? Was it a love story?  It had bits of everything and lost it all in the end.  Plus, it left me with so many questions!  A solid 10 for the 1st season. The 2nd barely made it a 6. Still, I really enjoyed it."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,9,,"""Gyeongseong Creature"" is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. Over the course of its 10-episode first season, I was captivated, mesmerized, and completely absorbed by the stunning beauty of this epic series. Though billed as a sci-fi body horror, it is so much more than that. This series is an epic saga, showcasing war crimes, a sweeping romance, and relentless thrills. The monster element is simply the cherry on top, as it's the human element that truly shines. The emotional core is driven by an incredible love story, one of the most emotionally satisfying and captivating narratives I have ever seen.  With its breathtaking sets, ""Gyeongseong Creature"" looks gorgeous, pulling you in from the first episode. Despite each episode running over 70 minutes, the experience is so immersive that you never want to hit pause. The journey and the destination are both worth every second.  I can't wait for Season 2 which luckily for me lands in 5 days. This show is epic and grandiose in every way. Easily one of the best shows I've ever watched.  Perfection!"
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,8,,"Season 1 was good. Sort of starts off slow but if you push through, the season pulls you in and becomes a captivating world war 2 period action drama show. Writing was excellent, well acted, amd the main couple had excellent chemistry.  I was hesitant to watch season 2 because initially I was thrown for a loop as it jumped to current day. I did not what to expect so I was expecting a direct continuation of the first season. I finally sat down and watched season 2 and I was wrong. Thought it was better and more concise than first season. They did a perfect job of linking the characters frim season 1 who are still around. Action was well done. The good acting and chemistry actually got better. Ending was not totally a happy ending but it looked like it was heading to one with main characters. Very impressed with season2.  I hope they have a season 3 to close things out as there was a post credit scene setting up more. Now that the current time situation is established, it should be a blast."
경성 크리처,Gyeongseong Creature,2023,9,,"Good story. I like both actor & actress. They look good together. Hopefull for season 3. I was little bit upset dew to low minimum episode in s2. Lets hope for the best in s3 if it comes. After watching series, i k.now the dark side of japan. Good to see the story. I hope makers plan to make s3. Lots of love."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,7,,"I was genuinely surprised to see low ratings for this show. I think many people drop it after the first few episodes and to be fair I almost did too since it was a bit slow boring. However, the show picks up around episode 3 and I found myself liking the show more and more each episode. The cast is great and there are a lot of funny moments. I think if anyone is considering watching the show I advise you to stick it out atleast passed the first three episodes. I can see why some people might have dropped it after only watching the first few episodes, but I'm glad I stuck it out because it got better. It's a comforting show to watch and I look forward to the episodes each weekend. If anyone has dropped this show I recommend giving it a second chance."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,7,,"I've noticed the reviews going down for this show ever since episode 7. DON'T LISTEN TO THEM. This show is cute and a feel good show and the leads are beautiful and have a lot of chemistry. It's not really dramatic but it's not an outright comedy either. It's cute and leaves you feeling fluffy and happy. I would recommend it if you're in the mood for something simple like that.  I'm currently on the vacation episode and it's so fun. I also think that that the show does a good job of showing how corporations poorly treat their employees and how working hard does not always equate to success. So, even within the fluff, there's a nice message forming. Plus, the two main romances are quite cute."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,7,,"So in episode 9 there is a depiction of an Arab prince that is not Arab but Indian and does all sorts of things not allowed in Islam, which is the reason for all the hate in this series. You may also notice a lot of reviews from Islamic countries due to this controversie. The rating is not an accurate representation of the quality of the series. However, do not be discouraged to watch this if you are not Muslim! For most people this series will score a solid 7 at least and should rank somewhere between 7-8 probably.  It is an enjoyable serie with good acting and some humor and plot twists and turns. Sure, it is not the most original plot or innovative and apparently not even culturally appropriate but it is an enjoyable watch that will satisfy most RomCom and Comedy Drama watchers. The quality is on average still way above most hollywood series and movies nowadays too.  In short, feel free to watch the first episode as it is fun to watch and a good representation of the overall quality of the series. I am sure you won't be disappointed! Again, if you are Muslim perhaps skip this series as it is not for you and you and you may feel like it severely misrepresents your culture and customs."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"I Don't understand the low rating, I guess there's some kind of ridiculous boycott I don't know about.  The show it's a rom com that reminds me a lot of those old school kdramas, reminded me a bit of what's wrong with secretary kim, I don't know why!  The plot is no complicated and it's filled with with sweet scenes, silly comedy and funny moments.  I loved to see The actor playing Prince Samir back again! ( heartbreaking when I watched Squid Game! ) he was fantastic here too)  I like the chemistry between the leads and you will be glad to find NO dead fish kisses in this drama whatsoever.  And the die hard friendship between the three girl friends and how they are always there for each other was awesome as well.  Overall very enjoyable! You shouldn't t miss it."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"""King of the Land"" is a heartwarming K-drama that wraps you in a cozy blanket of comfort and cuteness. Its endearing storyline and relatable characters create an immersive experience that left me chuckling like never before. The male lead's character is a shining example of all things charming and endearing, making it impossible not to root for him. The drama's ability to evoke genuine laughter after a prolonged absence is a testament to its delightful writing and exceptional performances. For anyone seeking a feel-good escape with a dash of romance and a lot of laughter, ""King of the Land"" is an absolute green flag."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,7,,"I really liked the show.  I am on episode 7 now and I think it's a cute and lovely story line. I can understand people don't like the rich guy poor girl story line, but I did not think that much trough with that in this show.  The female character shows a lot of love for her job and passion, I think that's such a great thing about the show. And the male character changes and is inspired by this female lead and in my opinion is also a nice thought.  Overall I think I did not expect this much hate in the reviews, I am really shocked. A lot of the reviews come from very experienced k-drama fans, so yeah maybe this show is not what u expected and see a lot but maybe for newer fans ore for fans who aren't into k-drama this much it's a nice show to watch!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"This is a sweet ROM COM . I do not understand the low ratings. It seems like bots protesting the ""controversy"" .... um.. Samir? I know Middle Eastern men like him .. He was just over the top but nothing bad.  There is a lot of humor and emotion in this show. The actress that plays the evil sister is brilliant. Ugh , she is awful , the charachter that is !  It does start off a tiny silly but boy it sure blossoms into the most beautiful romance. I highly recommend . It is so heartwarming, sad, sweet, touching, funny .. oh heck it gets you in all the feels . I love the message of honoring everyone ."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,,,"I guess you'll have to watch it to find out if you love or hate it. I agree that the start was slow, but now I really look forward to it on the weekends and I'm smiling throughout the episode. Hate the plot all you want but the lead couple and other actors have done a great job. Love the development and natural style of the lead couple, and how they both are not perfect but developing their communication and really perfect together. The visuals are nice too. I really appreciate this drama, it gave me so many positive moments. Given the either 1 or 10 star reviews, I guess at least it doesn't leave you indifferent."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,7,,"A lot of fun humor between Lee Jun-ho and Yoona and between Lee Jun-ho and Ahn Se-ha who plays his assistant. Also loved the line from Jun Ho as he is leaving the palace: 'This place looks familiar' (reflecting on The Red Sleeve). Jun Ho, once again, demonstrates his ability to play any type of character. His immense talent may be one of the reasons for lower ratings as some viewers may have expected him to continue taking on more and more challenging roles, which this is not. Would have been better if the Arab prince was played by someone from the country he is supposed to represent. This is just a reflection of the extremely limited number of roles for foreigners in South Korean dramas. Beautiful, beautiful clothing and set design. The fake wedding was magnificent!!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,8,,"I am unsure why this show has such a low rating but to each his/her own. I really loved this series because with all the hell going on in the world, it was good to be taken away to a funny, romantic/fantasy like world to escape things. It's a bit cheesy but that's what makes it wonderful as I for one am tired of all the violent and depressing movies right now. It's good to just escape.  The main leads to a great job and the message is simply to write your own story, follow ones dreams and love and be loved. It's kind of a throw back to the K-dramas of old which is why I loved it. The supporting cast is brilliant and funny and the twists keep coming. It also provides insight into the corporate world of South Korea and the politics that go on. I wish they would have done a little more with the older sister and had her soften up a bit earlier but better late than never.  If you want to just escape and have good thoughts that make you feel good, then definitely watch this."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"It is a beautiful romantic comedy. Hours just fly by when you are watching this.  The show documents the lives of diverse characters unlike other shows which focus on only the main leads. It explores various forms of relationships from multiple levels: father-son, step siblings, employer-employee, rich-poor etc. The strong bond of true friendship among three young women occupies a good chunk of the drama.  Overall, it is a fun-to-watch, moderately slow burn romance drama with a tinge of mystery interspersed.  The actors have a marvelous job playing their respective roles and it has quickly become one of favorite shows.  Hence, the rating of 2.4 out of 10 is utterly ridiculous and misleading for such great series."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Loved this series! Not sure why the low rating!! Laughed, cried and the story is just beautiful! Highly recommend and a must see! Full of romance, family and comedy! The story is wonderful and filled with so many sweet moments between the couple- they were so endearing there was no way you couldn't fall in love with them. Honestly, at the end I wanted to go back and see the series again. Both actors portrayed their role with so much sincerity and humbleness. They should do another series together- do much chemistry. Thank you for giving us the experience to feel so much joy. The ending was beautiful."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,7,,"This series had a great and strong start. The couple's chemistry was great from the start. The first few episodes were really great episodes, because they jumped right into the storyline without stalling. We also got introduced to some great side characters and their storylines.  This series also had a great balance of comedy, romance and drama. King The Land is full of cute moments between the couple, but we also get to see comedic moments and some entertaining drama.  The ending of this series was also really strong, but it came too late. The last 4-5 episodes weren't nearly as good as the first 10 episodes. Suddenly the story started to feel really slow and repetitive. The story could have ended earlier in my opinion. But I did like how the last episode tied everything together."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Loved this romantic series....it's light funny brilliantly acted ...it's a great feel good series, the like of which we Brits have forgotten how to make Very impressed with the script dialogue and acting....clothes are amazing especially the main male character Won.....they have an eye for detail....especially in the actual filming of it...both main characters have screen presence and charisma....  The only disappointment was when it finished.....however I have gone back and watched it several times Never tired of it......they have raised the bar so high I can't go back to the mediocre British dramas......and I am now hooked on Korean dramas..."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,7,,"First few episodes aren't out of the world but the character development is what makes this show so good. This was a first k drama in a while and I was worried oh how are they gonna treat this predictable plot, is the girl gonna be always ashamed for being poor? That was so not what the air time was given to, thank goodness! They focused on the individual stories as much as romance and brought out some really good acting, comedy, charm and coziness. It's a good show to binge. Also the male character treats the female character equally (unlike Business Proposal smh). Lastly, TY for introducing me to Junho! He is such a good actor and talented overall. I am like amazed by him after watching multiple drama and coming back to this and then his other work!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,9,,"This show got off to a slow start, and it's less fun when some characters are just blindly ragingly mean.  But the two leads have good chemistry, the gals hanging out is fun, and Mr Ngo is passable comic relief. This show introduces a little, and ever episode introduces a little more.  The chemistry of this story is basically Mary Poppins in a dog-eat-dog world, some far-fetched though passable events that make for escapist storytelling, and the Little Women theme of surviving in the modern world.  It wouldn't be a KDrama if the handsome lead didn't meet up with the most gorgeous gal in the world... who has a BF.  Again, the first couple episodes are OK, but the story gets more interesting."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,7,,"This is one of the best Rom-Coms out there that features how difficult true love can be in a world where social status and inheritance is King, so to speak. The chemistry is wonderful between Gu Won (Lee Junho), the Chairman's son and manager of the King Hotel chain , and Cheong Sa-rang (Im Yoon-ah) the most valued employee of the King Hotel. Their love and dedication to friends and family makes this a true feel-good story. And... those screen kisses...Wow! I'm not usually one who enjoys comedy-romance dramas, but this one makes you believe in the transformative power of true love and great friendships. A definite must see for all friends and lovers out there."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"The title sums up what this is in my opinion. Its certainly not a 3 out of 10 show.  Great production values and cast. All the characters have good chemistry and theres a lot of moments of levity.  I really dont get all the negativity. If you want to watch something that is going to make you forget your bad day then this is it.  Its light on the drama and heavy on the charm. I would like a bit more stakes overall in some parts but its really just a nitpick on my part.  The characters are all likeable and full fledged, even the rich guy has endearing qualities and flaws that ground him as a character."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,,,"It is the perfect kdrama!! I never usually write a review but I had to after s eing so much hate! It has romance, twisty family angle, it is SUPER FUNNY, IT IS A CLASSIC KDRAMA!! I do not really understand the hate and I'm writing this review after seeing the finale, which also was amazing. This drama has made me laugh, cry and blush like crazy! The chemistry between the main leads, the storyline of the side characters, the overall setup of the drama, and my god is Lee Jun-ho a handsome man! He makes me blush so bad when he smiles! And my god the episode where the six siblings go to a trip, it made me laugh like crazy, it was so so good!  I absolutely loved this drama and it was totally worth the wait."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,6,,"This like many a drama starts of slow, Gu-won and Sa-rang dance in and out of contact for the first few episodes, lightly interacting only when forced to (though Sa-rang stays prevalent in Gu won's mind) but once they get entangled with one another it becomes tight and true, their love blossoming beautifully and captivatingly, there is no wonderfully poetic writing or outstanding directing, but there is a solid script and workable directing, coupled with the great acting all around, it makes it feel almost real, you want to cheer for Gu when he wins, you feel for the girls when they get cheated out of their deserved rewards, and the kiss scene was one of the most beautiful, romantic and endearing kissing scenes I have ever watched, even past that it scales episode by episode, each one more heartfelt and sincere then the last, Lee Jun-ho and Im Yoon-ah have amazing chemistry and each corny line delivered feels sweet and beautiful instead of tacky and laughable (like many shows would have them be).  All around it is a well made show with some great parts to it, do not let the lazy reviews bashing this show put you off it, give it a go and you'll find yourself cheering along in no time."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,To be honest I am really surprised with the way anti fans are using this platform to demean the show. I think its probably because of the latest controversy over the show. But that doesn't give anyone the right to degrade the entire casts and crews hardwork.  This is such a nice show. Most of the people are loving it. But its sad to see negative thoughts are overshadowing the positive views. If you want to watch a romcom then this show is for you. I have been laughing soo much during the last 10 episodes of the show. The chemistry between the leads are on another level. They are just perfect cast. It has a simple plot which they portrayed nicely.  People commenting about polished scripts should know that almost 50% of the dramas have same plot.  Please do watch the drama. Its really good.
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,7,,"Not sure why most people are giving this show a low rating, I find this show way better than it's based story from 2014 ""Hotel King"". It's a good and slow paced romance, shows lots of detail on korean culture, shows how people don't exactly need to be rich to have a good life by joining 2 super diferent persons with very different life bases, the critics to overpowered people are really good as well.  The comedy used and actors expressions are so nice it made be feel like I was watching some good old series.  As I'm a fan of slower paced romances instead of a kiss on the first 10 minutes of a movie or even series... So this is a must see for me.  The fake smiles situation is atually a today's issue since it shows the opposite of how people should act, which of course they should act in a genuine and natural way."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"King The Land on Netflix - One of the best Romantic K-Drama's I have seen in a long time!! Just finished the final episode and even though the ending is predictable in RomCom's like this, it didn't disappoint at all. Love the chemistry of the 2 leads, male Lee Jun-ho as Won the handsome, smart, determined, hotel CEO who hated smiles, especially fake smiles and .Im Yoon-ah as Sa-rang the sophisticated, smart, hotelier who works her way up from the bottom by being the best talent and always has a smile on her face. They both do a great job in their roles in this love story. Lee Jun-ho has a unique voice that makes him stand out from other actors. Plenty of sweet kisses, romance, comedy and friendships. I rate it so high because one of the few shows that was hard to wait a whole week for the next episode to air which is unusual. See alot of haters giving low ratings but we need to remember this is a fictional TV show, not a documentary. Never saw anything out of place or had any thoughts of anything wrong when I watched it and I saw every episode. Loved it. I notice it is on Viki as well. The side stories amongst had a few love stories too that all came to endings in the last episode."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,7,,"I was surprised the rating was so low, cute little drama that should not be taken seriously, but simply enjoyable . It started interesting and funny, There was an interesting slow development, and at some point got slower and a little less addictive, but In the last episodes it became intriguing again. I loved the ending. There were also funny parts throughout the series. The actors did a good job and managed to move me. Overall a heartwarming feel-good optimistic k-drama with beautiful people who are pleasant to look at. Recommended for people who are looking for something light, sweet, a little exciting, and have patience for drama. Doesn't require much thinking."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Serious stories, heartbreaks are good but nothing beats a good romantic K-drama. There are no hardcore villains, just a feel good , easy on the heart story. The ML is a walking talking green flag just how it should be. The chemistry between the lead couple is just fire! Love the kisses because it was kissing and not just dead fish banging lips. Love love love the female friendships and normalizing divorces and understanding normal boyfriends. Love how the husband one of the friends had to learn household chores! This show lightly showed many things that today's society needs to see and adapt. It's become one of those shows I'll watch again on gloomy days! Lee Jun ho just won my heart!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"I think this is a fantastic series! Im Yoon-ah just kills it in every scene, and I wasn't the biggest fan of hers either (she was just ""ok"" I thought in ""The K2""). Her facial expressions and comedic timing are impeccable, and she has laugh out loud dialogue with the male protagonist (who also does a good job).  I noticed a lot of reviews seem to be about the early episodes, but later in the series some of the banter with her overconfident and jaded male protagonist is just great! The way she handles him, gently and amusingly mocking him at times is really well done.  I have seen several KDrama's/Rom Coms not nearly as good as this one with MUCH higher reviews...so these reviews make no sense to me.  Also, I typically do not care for the ""comedic duo"", or sidekicks many KDrama's have. They are often annoying or try way too hard to be funny. Not so with this series. The two women sidekicks have real problems, real stories of their own, but they are very funny in some of their scenes too. Also, the male sidekick to the male protagonist is great, and constantly gets away with needling his boss - which just goes to show that contrary to his front, the male protagonist is a ""good guy"".  If you gave up, give it a chance again through episode 8, the banter is truly good between them.  Just to be fair, there are a couple things I didn't like either. The Arab Prince, the Cliff Jump, etc. So it has its faults, but overall it's a great show and worthy of a ""10"". I will revisit this review after the series is over and adjust accordingly but if you like these types of shows you will NOT be disappointed with this one!  I have reviewed over a dozen KDrama's and have a public list on IMDB of ones I have watched and rated, and most of the time I am very much in agreement with the overall ratings. Not so with this series: I say watch it and enjoy!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,7,,"There is much to commend this show as it is an uncomplicated romance/comedy. It appears to have attracted a lot of negativity in many reviews but please do not pay any attention to them. King The Land is far from perfect but it is no way a 1 or 2 rating as many have described. I found it to be cute in many ways, reminiscent of What's Wrong With Secretary Kim, but not quite Secretary Kim's appeal. So what went wrong? For me, there was too much emphasis on long kissing scenes, too many love song interludes (should I say interruptions?) which ended up making scenes repetitive.  As in many Korean shows, the audience has to take the action with a rather large grain of salt and I refer to the helicopter ""rescue"" scene. If the writers had managed things like this even a little more realistically, it would have made the show better.  And one further point, why on earth do the male characters in so many Korean shows wear obvious lipstick? If any directors out there read this, please stop it. It looks ridiculous and serves no purpose whatever, except maybe to highlight a fashion in Korea of which I am totally unaware.  Finally, a big congratulations to the supporting cast. They were wonderful. That's not to say the main cast were bad, they did their job admirably with the script they were given."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,I love watching asian series and i must admit this series has a lot of unfair bad reviews from the haters. I dont understand why because this series is really hard worked and the actors are playing very well. The plot is nice and even if it is a stereotype it is still nice and relaxing. I consider the score it got on imdb is totally unfair and i cannot help but wonder if is not deliberately given just to discredit the movie or the future viewers. What i think is that people dont understand this is not a serious series but a romantic comedy and they have to behave accordingly. So i for one totally recommend this series for those who want to relax and not think too much over a movie.
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,7,,"I love the leads and will watch them every time. They and the rest of the cast worked hard, and they did have some good moments during the series. There were sweet love scenes and a wonderful scene between mother and son that brought tears. Junho nailed that emotional moment as he is an actor who knows how to be still and let his eyes speak for him. He can rise to the moment even with a bad script. But this drama was uneven from the beginning, even without the episode that offended many viewers and with a clumsy, dull ending. Those issues lie right at the feet of the writer and director. What a shame because the cast and audience deserved so much better."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"I'm not sure why people are hating so much on this kdrama but it's a good one. How good? I value my 8 hour sleep before work but after watching 1 episode of this kdrama, I stayed up and binge watched 6 episodes. It's a funny and sweet kdrama, really well shot, with not too big holes in scenario. I wish it had a higher rating because it really warms my heart to watch it. I have been watching kdramas for years now and I don't say this about many of them: it's a really good one. Try giving it a chance before dismissing it.  P. S. The music in this TV show is also really really good! 9/10! Highly recommend."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,6,,"I am American and this was my first k-drama. There was a lot of culture shock and confusion for me all the way through the 16 episodes. This is a very different style from any American show I've seen. There were silly sounds played to enhance the comedy which really turned me off at first, I eventually just ignored it as I think this just might be cultural. Outside of that, once the two leads start liking each other it got very cute. I found myself smiling as I watched them. I would say it takes awhile to get good, it's probably around the 10th episode where it gets really cute and fun. I found myself drawn into the main actor he got better every episode."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,It's a feel good romcom.... I love the chemistry. I love how she was not intimidated with power people around her and showed them grace at all times and same with her friends and what made him attracted and eventually fell in love. His character of bitterness changed because of her. And in today's society who keeps preaching 'be kind' but not practicing it ...this show showed a lot of kindness and grace and how she was able to influence people around her. Ignore the reviews from reviewers who just watched two episodes. The show is worth it and kept me smiling 'hermes' 😊 The soundtrack is very good too.
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"I love it! The cast (leading and supporting) is amazing! The story is super cute. I don't understand the low rating here, for it's one of the best k-series ever, IMHO. There are lots of funny scenes, really hilarious. It's a story about love and true friendship. The highlights go to the main protagonists (both great-looking and charming), Sa-rang's best friends, Mr. No, Sa-rang's grandma, and Samir. Great show! When I started watching it, I didn't expect to get so hooked on it. I think Won's change was well developed. This character's evolution was beautiful to witness. Sa-rang, from the start, proved to be one memorable character, embodying noble values that are surely needed and rarely seen in our nowadays society."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,7,,"The storyline wasn't novel or amazing. It was pretty simple and relatively slow, with nothing too exciting. There was also some misrepresentation of other cultures in the earlier episodes, so that should have been better researched before it was incorporated into the drama. Other than that, it was a pretty easy and fun watch. The side characters were cute and had their own side stories. The lead actors had good chemistry with each other, and in terms of the romance, there were many green flags in the way they handled their conflicts! No overly draggy problems due to miscommunication or anything. Overall, it was a nice drama to watch to pass time :)"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,9,,"This series is a sweet romance about a man meeting a woman, they have a little conflict, and slowly fall for each other. Love watching this budding romance unfold. It's funny, sweet, and fun. Both Lee Junho and Yoona were strong leads! Gums are always lighthearted, fun to watch, sometimes you might even get some butterflies. The support actors were equally good. Also, a little inside the hotel business was fun to witness. This is a perfect romcom, from the talented and attractive actors, beautiful locations, fancy hotels, luxury cars, to the sweet romance. King the Land is a 10! Well worth your time to watch!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,7,,"I love Rom-coms and I love Jun-ho and I wanted to love this series but what a let-down. It has every cliche in the book and no originality and believe me Rom-coms can be original (just watch Dali and Cocky Prince to see what can be done to make a Rom-com shine.) I like both leads but even they can´t carry the boring plot. It has its moments but I just saw episode 10 and it is basically nothing more than a 60 minute marketing piece for Thailand. And, does the male lead ever work? His sister is the bad one but I am starting to feel sorry for her. At least she seems to stick around the hotel. I will probably finish it but I am so disappointed."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Fantastic rom-com reminiscent of old-school K-dramas like 'What's Wrong with Secretary Kim.' The simple yet sweet plot, hilarious comedy, and heartwarming moments make it a must-watch. Great chemistry between the leads, The strong bond among the three girlfriends adds an awesome touch. Im Yoon-ah shines with impeccable expressions and timing, making every scene enjoyable. The banter between the leads gets better as the series progresses. This show deserves a solid 10! I don't know who are these people who didn't like the show I loved it from my bottom of my heart give it a shot it will make you happy for sure. ""Highly recommended for K-drama fans."""
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,6,,"I'll admit that the first few episodes were pretty cringy. It felt a little forced but I think the actors weren't completely comfortable with their characters yet. I kept watching and by the end, I was so impatient waiting for the new episodes.  They definitely grew into their characters and the chemistry developed with some cuteness overload! It's your classic cheesiness, easygoing romcom with a plot that's easy to follow. If you just need something feel-good to watch after a long day, this a good one to watch.  I say stick with it and give it a fair chance. Don't let the first few episodes deter you."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Loved it all from the over-the-top comedy to the heart-felt family tragedies. And did I mention the chemistry between Jun-ho and Yoon-a? Credit to the director, writers, actors, casting crew, cameramen, and any others involved with this refreshing drama. I fell in love and didn't want this drama to end. I was in pain having to wait a week to see the next episode. Nicely written and not raunchy. Keep coming back with the ""classy!""  Additional props to the Wardrobe and Makeup departments who made the cast look incredible! Wow!!! Part of the reason for my 10-STAR rating. Everything that I wanted in a drama and it was delivered!  I want my youth back!  #KingTheLand."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"The low reviews are quite shocking frankly. The chemistry between the 2 main characters is consuming and the development of the love story is both realistic and beautifully told. Tbh I've had it on repeat for the last week. It's just a nice simple love story set in the backdrop of a hotel and the other side stories are complimentary and very interesting. The show is also extremely funny, I had many laugh out loud moments... Particularly scenes including Mr No and the grandmother. In my opinion the show was cast perfectly. I'm very new to Korean drama but this has made me a lover for sure. Wish I could watch it for the first time again."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,6,,"Basically it's a old school type drama between ceo and employee.like ""whats wrong with secretary Kim"".yes the plot is bit different but I am very disappointed with hero characterization.every drama needs to have a strong and unique characterization but this drama is lacking so much in that department.overall a watchable drama(atleast for now).my opinion may change later..🤔.may be the hero character can build up massively and become competitive and waiting for certain twist where the story is basically predictive until now.some twists and turns will help these drama to gain more stars atleast from me 😌"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"I'm surprised how this drama received a lot of bad views. I mean what's wrong with them? Seriously what is wrong? The drama is very fun to watch, and it has shown a good portrait of many hards worker in today world that they haven't received back the suitable reward or well appreciation from their higher. Besides, everything else is run smoothly. The lead actor and actress have a very sweet chemistry. They have done a very great job to make us enjoying their love and their funniest. If you don't like the drama, I think it really has nothing to do with the drama at all. Maybe it's just not your type of drama."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"This series has me waiting excitedly for weekends. It's a cheesy, rom-com with a lot of unrealistic things going on, but then, that doesn't mean it's any bad. It's actually one of the best of its kind.  King The Land is addictive, not because of the popular leads but because of the chemistry they have(It's the best chemistry ever after CLOY). It had a slow beginning. First two Ep's didn't make me like the movie at the instant. I really got into it from episode 4 and now I can't stop. In the end, this movie needs patience. Don't be quick to judge what has definitely turned out to be an epic series."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,7,,I am gonna be honest even tho i stan Kpop and i also stan the main lead Lee Junho and Im yoo-ah. I am not gonna show favoritism. It was OKAY i am not gonna say bad or good it was okay. It was romantic and funny and there were some part which i liked and laughed a lot. I don't think it was that good. When i heard that they were gonna be in a K drama i was excited so i watched it as soon as it released but i think it wasn't worth the wait. But i really liked their acting and their chemistry. I would say it is a one time watch but i wouldn't say must watch if you have nothing to watch you can try watching. My opinion doesn't have agree with your opinion maybe you have liked it but it was okay for me and no hate to anyone acting in the drama. THIS IS ONLY MY OPINION.
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,8,,"Im Yoon-ah plays Cheon Sa-rang a hotel worker who is very dedicated to her job and is an outstanding employee serving the King hotels guests for whom she works. Into her life comes Goo Won played by LeeJun-ho who is the son of the owner of King group who owns various businesses including the hotel. He is an irresponsible playboy who is estranged from his family and has no interest in his fathers business. The series is incredibly well acted and with a great supporting cast all dealing with their own various problems. It has received criticism on two fronts, one being it is a rehash of many past dramas but I think that is part of the appeal as it's aim is to warm your heart with the nostalgic tropes. The other being the way an Arab was portrayed which offended many people who have awarded a one score to show their displeasure."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,9,,"I really liked this show. The production is great and the story very relaxing and sweet.  I am ashamed for all the people that, for whatever reason, decided to degrade this show and the effort of all those behind it.  You couldn't even finish the first episode? What were your expectations when you started watching? Because this show completely fulfilled mine. Its a very nice romantic comedy, with adorable cast. So sweet and almost zero cringe, unlike ""business proposal"" or ""love to hate you"", which made me cringe abundantly, and yet have unrealistically high ratings.  Trolling should be banned. As well as unobjective ratings.  Anyways, kudos for delivering what i was hoping for, a cute love story and 16 feelgood hours."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Was going to keep it simple but..  This show is honestly one of my favourites that I've watched out of any show I've seen.  Really appreciate the actors and actresses! So beautiful and genuine.  The story of both characters, and how far they have come within themselves and for one another was special to see.  King the Land is just amazing, it made me smile, laugh, cry and I'm really happy with the way it ended!  Also, I don't personally understand the rating being so low? The show is brilliant, beautiful and funny! Nothing to be critical about at all.  To all involved in the making of this amazing show, thank you!  And to the actors and actresses, you really did amazing.  Thank you for giving us your precious time and giving us great memories🙂"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"I looked through reviews to see why this is rated so low. I will admit I initially was not hooked by the plot. Gu Won parachuting to the hotel on his first day made me think that they knew who he was, but they had no idea he is the hotel owner's son. He made friends with the guy who became his assistant, No Sang-sik, then and I cheered. Sa-Rang is just delightful because she is hardworking and likes her job. I find myself saying in my head ""Hermes"" when I don't feel like smiling. Overtime she and other characters change Gu Won's thinking about service. It reminded me of Maid in Manhattan.  I saw that some people felt writers disrespected the people of Saudi Arabia. I did not see that because I took it to be more about the relationship between the prince, and Gu Won. A rivalry was there. It's not really about the country but about the character.  What I like about Korean dramas is the stories are always multi-layered. There's often a backstory that we see you running throughout the explains the motivations of characters. I tried to think what it reminds me of, and it made me think of Victorian novels. You have class struggle and often one class learns from the other. The endings aren't always happy... but usually there is an epilogue.  Oh, and most of these dramas are made up of foodies like me. What's not to love?"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Well I was put off a little at first with the blatant fat-shaming of female flight attendants, then by the blatant product placement, but I overcame it with a cute and silly, if somewhat 100% predictable storyline and also the ML being one of my future husbands. (Ok that's a lie but I can dream). Junho is one of my favourite singers so I'm a bit biased, but then again Yuna impressed me in Hyori's Homestay so I kept on watching the series and haven't regretted it yet.  The Middle Eastern Prince eps were obviously not meant to be anything but satire of a really SUPER rich person, so just chill and see the funny side of two enormously wealthy friends bickering for fun. (People all over the world stereotype Australians as all being outback weirdos like Steve Irwin and Paul Hogan, but no one takes that seriously enough to give 1 star reviews when they see the stereotype in shows).  Anyway, a predictable fun show that is really only meant to be silly romantic fun. Don't take it or life too seriously and just enjoy yourselves."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,6,,"Yesterday finished another kdrama 'King the Land'  It's another swoon-worthy, cute, sweet rom-com.  Story is same old, rich guy-poor girl, how their hate relationship turned into love.  It's very predictable, there is zero tention in the plot. There is zero novelty in the story. It's a mixture of many popular kdramas.  All problems get solved easily. FL is too perfect in everything, and ML's only work is to woo FL somehow to accept him.  Anyways, it seems, they made this drama for Lee Jun-ho and Yoon-ah's fans. And it made fans very happy. Drama does get into controversy over wrong Arab cultural representation. Apart from that, it's a time pass, stress buster, easygoing drama."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Junho is superb in this drama. It is sweet and endearing as the romance unfolds. The scenes between Junho and Yoona have me smiling from ear to ear because the chemistry between him and Yoona is fabulous!!!! I anticipate each episode!! The story line is simplistic so far (boy meets girl and falls head over heels) but the rivalry between ML and his sister is just starting to heat up, so I anticipate a good plot development in the upcoming episodes. The first nine episodes were really great, and I expect the remaining episodes to be just as good. I will be tuned in for each one! Keep up the good work!!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,6,,"It seems as if this series intended to incorporate all of the familiar and popular themes of current day Korean productions but missed the mark on most of them.  The main characters are likeable and if you stick with the first few episodes you will eventually be drawn in but it is tough to come away from watching it all without some disappointment.  The villains aren't villainous enough and the roadblocks challenging the love between two persons of differing societal status are merely small hurdles.  Still, if you stick with it and can get past a sometimes confusing, interweaving storyline, this series has many redeeming aspects."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"I got on here to see the actors and what else they've been in and was SHOCKED to see a 2.something rating for this show. Like what in the actual world?! Are people that hardened that they can't enjoy a ""trope"" (sometimes a little corny) romantic comedy? Unreal. I genuinely wish people would just calm down and enjoy it for what it is. W/ everything in the world being either so dark that its unwatchable (world is dark enough on its own), or just ridiculously played out in the worst way, I think it's honestly wild that people can't just enjoy this for what it is...  Rant over. I turned this on, randomly, and was sucked in immediately. It's simple, cute, clean, and fun. It's actually funny too. The actors are great, the leads are believable and have good chemistry. The dialogue for the most part isn't bad at all. I'm even invested in the B Plots and how it will all work out. Definitely am hooked.  Hope they keep up the good work."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"As you've seen the low ratings, you'll probably wonder why that's the case. Firstly, just ignore them. This show for the past 8 weeks has just given me so much joy and laughter.  The chemistry between the two leads was off the chat, Yoona and Jun-Ho were made for the roles. The OST, was amazing, the storyline was perfect. It's a romcom, so of course it's going to be filled with cheesy moments. That's what it's there for. I'm just so gutted this show has come to an end.  Every Saturday and Sunday, I would look forward to King the Land. There are scenes that'll give you a tear, that'll have you laughing out loud, that'll want to make you punch your screen. But it's all worth it.  Just ignore the hateful comments you've seen by the Arab community and if you love Kdramas and Romcoms, give this show a chance. You won't regret it."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,,,"If you are part of the herd, blindly obsessed with stars, then you blame the haters without seeing how badly this production is made. For those who saw the original from 2014, the production leaves the feeling of a counterfeit copy from the country that produces the jewelry advertised in it. If Yoona and JunHo, the professional grandmother, the professional old president, had not been cast, it would have been a total fiasco. Because: - it's terribly poorly written. - annoying with the insistence of product placement (Chinese jewelry for which the proposal scene was postponed, German cars, ramyun and others). Even scenes from other productions were copied, but inserted without inspiration. Which makes the direction bad. The editing is also, for the most part, deficient. Of course, as in these conditions, the acting of the actors seems to be at its best. For the level of Korean productions, the quality is terrible. Closer to Cinderella and Boss CDrama with Korean actors. Saved only by the fans' desire to see their beloved stars at the wedding."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,7,,"Expecting a lot more, set in a high class Hotel. Both LeeJun-ho and Im Yoon-ah were top notch, first time seeing them. Fairly predictable, a commoner attracting the eye of the, ""Prince"", character. The main female character seemed to have got a cushy ride to the top, with just s few hiccups, expecting more and the Prince character got his own way, quite easily, everything he touched, worked, Always expect Kim Young-ok to play her part and as minor as it was, she didn't disappoint. As with a lot of K-Dramas, the ending was very anti climatic, everyting was tied up in a neat little bow, too neat."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,.... Wonderful casts.... Thoroughly enjoyable plot. It has everything for the K drama fans indeed the delicious meal for a craving K drama addicts... it's a must watch and deserves to be in the Top K dramas list. The Samir Arab character is too perky and refreshing... I would like to watch the leads more ..can't wait for more episodes .......BGM is too lively and kicking... the series is like hitting the right spot of every K drama addicts and the writing is really good... the plot is typical K drama plot but this is what all we need and the reason we are watching it... hope the rest of the few episodes won't disappoint us. Lots of love from me to the team the king the land .
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,7,,"If you're looking for a lighthearted RomCom with a sweet main couple, this one is for you. The story is simple but still engaging enough and most of the characters enjoyable yet not that deep. I like K-Dramas where the main couple doesn't break up after getting together, because often enough it just seems overly dramatic. ""Kind the Land"" delivers that. The two main leads are very sweet (with very good kisses and even lots of them), although they could have more interesting dialogues, and the second couple's story is also cute. Still, the humour is quite silly most of the time, and the plot around the third friend and her lazy husband doesn't really add anything, as there isn't much development.  Overall, it's a simple, cute romance with good chemistry between the main characters."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,9,,"Lots has been said about this Kdrama, but I will just stick to the story and leave out any reference to the apologies already made.  If you want something fun and with great chemistry between the main actors, then this is for you! Yes, it's a little corny/cheesy in places, but that is why we like rom com! To have a laugh and forget about the world outside for just a minute. There are parts that are exaggerated and others that are very touching. It is an enjoyable show which at this point, does not require a lot of thinking. That being said, it's only partly released and if there is one thing I know about Kdrama, there is always a twist in the tale. Will be interested to see where we end up. 🙂"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"I stopped at episode 11 because that's around the time the main leads became a couple but a I picked it up after a few months because it kept popping up in my recommendations (and because Lee Jun Ho looks so dashing in every shot), and I'm glad I did! Because this drama is more than a romance genre - it also tells the story of how the hotel industry works behind the scenes and shows how customer service can be improved by going the extra mile - as demonstrated by the female lead, Choi Sa Rang, the best talent - especially presented at the latter part of the story. Overall, a good show and not too much of a typical romance story."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,6,,"I really, really love Jun Ho in The Red Sleeve and so was anticipating great things for this series. But, sad to say, it fell short. The positives are that everyone looks great with their perfect lighting, makeup and clothing and my favourite elder actress was also in it. Plus, the kisses are, well, great.  BUT, it fell so short in content, depth and was boring. After the first four episodes I tuned out, deciding to come back when all the episodes were available because it was just not engaging me. Now I am on episode 10 and struggling to get to episode 16. I have even found myself fast forwarding through the scenes. Oteke? I will get to episode 16 to see if it redeems itself and can give it a higher score."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"First of all I liked this series to my heart. You know I write reviews very less but I cant stop myself after seeing such a low rating to this heartwarming content. I read many reviews of this and I saw people writing boring plot and no drama and thriller, my limit was reached when I saw a review writing there are no love breakup in this series. He/She literally said that this is boring because love story is not complicated, not full of misunderstandings and fights. I cannot accept this, I personally have seen many series full of drama but I personally request that people who like those type of drama plase dont watch it and give bad review. For me its one of my best masterpieces with a simple and heartwarming story, Good characters and veryyyyy loving.  In the end, I would say this masterpiece is made for those who are tired of twisted thriller plots and want some feel good and loving stuff.  Thank you for reading my review."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,9,,"I thoroughly enjoyed this Kdrama and the acting of Lee Jin Ho and Im Yoon Ah. I think they were casted well together and had good chemistry. I have always thought Lee Jin Ho was a great actor with a lot of heart. I hope there are more shows in the future that have both characters in them. I thought the supporting cast, particularly Sa rang's grandmother were delightful.  I was very surprised and dismayed by the negative reviews as I don't feel this show deserved them. It was so nice to watch something that was so cute and loving and funny at a time when so much being made is dark or negative or sad. I hope more shows like this are made and shown on Netflix.  Thank you."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,9,,"It has everything, romance, suspense... it is a classical modern fairytale which a lot of us enjoyed. Perhaps a bit cheesy in the end but that's because it's a fairytale. Don't we need to kind of escape from reality.  Yeah some lose ends here and there in the plot but who cares. It's still wonderful to watch. We all love the grandmother 👵🏼 and the story in general. Also the moral they try to convey here is a good one. The film sets are beautiful and both main actors have good chemistry. Lots of kiss scenes which is very much appreciated. Everyone who watched it gave the same feedback so I really don't understand the bad rating here."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,Best Rom com drama ever. Don't listen to the reviews and rating. Light hearted feel good drama just what you need when you don't want to get into heavy plots drama where you have to get deep into the plots to understand the story. Recommend it 10/10. Great cast and good chemistry of the lead characters and side characters. Many episodes will make you giggle and blush ear to ear. Worth the watch. Have to say it is 2023 best Rom com drama. Give it a go you won't regret it . Classic drama that will make your heart melt and make you want more and more and rewatch each scene that makes you feel giddy.
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Like all beloved K- Dramas, this one has the same magic formula that works! Grumpy, sad boy meets sweet kind hearted girl who changes his life. And the side characters who make you fall in love with them along the way. The good friends who are there for you no matter what and that unexpected friend who becomes loyal forever And always a loving grandma to sweeten it all. I LOVED IT! Not as good a love story as Crash Landing on You, but as funny as Mr Queen! I still gave it a 10 because it made me feel good at the end and I was hooked from the end of the first episode! One of THE funniest ends to a first episode! 💕"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"This title is so healing to watch. The movie is a combination of comedy and romance. Junho and Yoona capture that so perfect with their acting skills and chemistry.  I am drawn to this movie at first by Junho. He is so perfect in acting from the Red Sleeve to this movie. His efforts have paid off through all the years. I laugh a lot during the movie.  Besides acting, the scenery in the movie, cause it's about hospitality, is magnificent. The movies features mainly Korea and some of Thailand (in one trip abroad). I have been to Korea once and it's so amazing to see the country captured nicely in the movie.  Again, this is one my recommendations for healing times."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"For some period of time, I am tired with new Kdrama with so many heavy themes and topics but this series is seriously GREAT. It is so light hearted, romantic, and reminds me of so many beautiful love moments in my life with my boyfriend (now husband).  I feel relieved and so happy after watching it! It really saved me from stressful work hours (and learning master at same time)!  Now I wait and wait every day to watch behind the scenes and new episodes to be released!  I JUST LOVE IT for its simple story, no plot twist but true to your heart! The VISUALS are great too! And no words can describe how I like the ACTING! And best kiss scene ever in my many years watching dramas! JUNHO is why I started with this series and I just love every moment of his acting!  TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,It's light hearted drama. One gets quickly connected to characters Chemistry between lead actors is superb.  The storyline is good. Specially the development in the relationship between main leads as well as Co stars The struggle on employee's is shown in light way but impressive. The negative characters are also realistic and relatable  I would suggest this drama to all K drma lovers it's really fun to watch and enjoy each and every moment in it.  So it's my recommendation to watch it if you love romcom dramas  The acting is pretty good specially the male lead really gets your attention from the start.
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"I am so shocked that this series does not have a better rating. I guess I need to watch the actors and directors other work to understand why others did not see this as entertaining.  It is a complete gem to me and I have now watched this series at least 5 times. It entertained me from the first episode till the last. I wish there would be another season. I would purchase this series if it was available to buy. I fell in love with the characters. It was light and fun, how can you not fall in love with the characters. I was well done in my opinion and deserved a 10 out of 10 verses a 5 out of 10."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"I love crime thriller dramas, but sometimes lighthearted soothing dramas are needed too! King The Land is such a beautiful and peaceful drama. Loving the chemistry between the leads. It's getting more and more interesting! Such sweet scenes are melting me seriously! How can anyone hate this!!!!! I don't know. Anyways I'll definitely recommend people to watch King The Land. Lee Jun Ho and Kim Yoo Na really got to show their amazing cute side in this drama. Both of their previous dramas were sad ending drama. So now when they are doing happy romcom drama, I feel blessed :-D:-D:-D They even mentioned some relatable dialogues with their previous dramas. I found it unique 💖"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"This is a Korean typical romance drama, with excellent visual (Juhon and Yoona was just perfect for KTD)and wonderful actors and actresses. Especially SNSD Yoon, she was really nice as acting a hotel receptionist. Even the plot is a bit weak, the chemistry between Gu won and Sarang was really attractive.  The storyline was straight forward and all we need is Guwon and Sarang fall in love asap. Every moment was just too sweet. I enjoy spending 2hr a week on Netflix and watch a drama without thinking, just relax and laugh. However the scriptwriter should be more careful when using other cultures as plot, please dun distract the focus of this programme."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Amid a tense inheritance fight, a charming heir clashes with his hardworking employee who's known for her irresistible smile, which he cannot stand.

킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"For those saying that only fans of the lead characters will enjoy this show, I disagree. I loved King the Land and had no idea that either of them were idols until after the finale aired. KtL was quirky and fun, with lots of fluff and without the major life ending doom seen in so many dramas. There are some mild hurdles that have to be overcome in this romcom, but it was a relief to watch something that didn't leave me in tears toward the end of the series. If you want to unwind with a heart warming and humorous story, I would recommend watching this. It's one that I will definitely be watching again in the future."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Started off slow which is typical for kdramas and probably the reason for some bad reviews. I saw Junho for the first time in the red sleeve and his performance was mesmerizing so I decided to watch king the land. It started off as a cute lighthearted romcom but slowly turned into a heartwarming romance. The chemistry is incredible between the leads. The kiss scene was one of the most beautiful, romantic and endearing scenes I have ever watched. I have never scene anything so real. Either they are both incredible actors or there is more to their relationship than we know. Besides a couple boring episodes, the series has been excellent!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"The show is incredibly cute, wholesome and fun. It's refreshing to also see the female lead being a happy-go-lucky girl, able to stand her ground as well!  Some very enjoyable side characters, and an especially cute 2nd story. Incredible chemistry between the characters, with great pacing and captivating personalities.  Don't be misguided by the shows rating, that has recovered from a <2 star rating.  That's how good the show actually is."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,9,,"Not sure why the hate on this show, I don't think those reviews are legit. This show is cute and sweet. Absolutely a feel-good romance with lots of fluff. Gu Won is every green flag in the book, and Sa Rang is actually a female lead who deserves it. I love that she is a hard-working and competent woman with lofty aspirations, and I love the portrayal of a solidly healthy relationship between the leads. Second leads' relationship was also amazing. They're really raising the bar on how people in a relationship should actually treat each other and I'm here for it.  Don't listen to the hate on this one and give it a shot. Even though it's a bit slower-paced, this one is absolutely worth your time."

킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"I hated the lead male character for the first 5 episodes... then he becomes so likeable. It's a 16 episode series so there is so much to enjoy once you get past the rough relationship building episodes. The beginning was rough, but it became so sweet! I loved the characters, loved the creation of the 6 siblings, loved the humor, loved the chemistry. The lead female was really likeable,and so were her friends. The final episode gave me exactly what I needed and wanted! Not all shows are able to end their seasons in a way that the viewer feels satisfied with loose ends. This show left no loose ends, and it was a very satisfying finale."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"People often forget the difference between a trope and a cliché. A trope is a recurring element frequently used as a literary device whereas a cliche ""reflects patterns that are no longer effective."" KTL uses the ""rich man falls in love with the poor woman"" in a way that no previous show that I know of has before. The show focuses on the working class and rightly critiques the way companies take advantage of their workers, providing a humanitarian perspective that does NOT happen in other shows. It also critiques the view that Korean culture has on divorced women and the concept of men as head of households. KTL takes these modern and even controversial concepts and, like a cake, layers them with high-chemistry romance, comedy that commits to the bit, and a topping of drama. There are several other tropes present that are subversive as well, and I invite you to watch and observe how it treats them in a way that is realistic and humane, and directly prevents them from becoming clichés. Shows with this level of self awareness, shows that are so unapologetically genuine, are rare and this is certainly one of those gems. The actors are incredible and the pacing is great for mini binges. Please watch this!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"People who have watched it and have not liked it........please watch something else!!!! This is a wonderful Rom-Com drama that makes me laugh and brings a smile. I think the chemistry between the leads, makes it more interesting and watchable. Their lovable acting is captivating, and can't wait to finish the series. I would rate it 10/10 for its simple yet good story. The picturesque Jeju islands and the surroundings shown in the drama add to their beauty and relatability. Lee Junho is at his best just like in the red sleeve, and Yoona has done a great job too. The story may be a repetition of old stories but how does it matter? Having a good laugh and some cute romantic scenes make the drama more lovable. It is a stressbuster and if want some feel-good time, my advice would be to definitely watch this drama and have a good time. So...Hermes (Smile) !!!!!!!!!!!!1."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"I've finished episode 8 and I can say I really enjoyed watching this drama. It's a very lighthearted and cheesy kdrama, the actors have chemistry in my opinion and I can't wait to see more of it! I don't understand why it gets so many bad ratings, it's definitely not the best but not the worst either, and you can clearly see they wanted to deliver an easy to digest show, perfect for a lazy weekend. The cinematography is also very nice, again with quite some cheesy shots that may not be for everyone, but this kind of drama definitely has its appeal. Im looking forward to the next episodes and to see more of the actors!!!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,9,,"Okay so, I have seen the poor rating of the show and the mixed reviews.  I'll give you my honest opinion about the show. If you're undecided about whether you should watch this or not, please read this.  King the Land is one of those shows that don't take itself seriously. And for it's genre, i'd say that it's pretty good.  You see Cool and beautiful locations, good looking actors, it can be funny at times. Everything is made to make you have a ""Feels good"" moment. And it works. If you're in the right mood for it.  For me, TV Shows are like food. It's actually like food in a lot of ways, we consume them.  And most of the times, sure, i'd go for some high quality steak but sometimes, i'd rather go eat some junk food.  This show is for when you want to watch something more chill, cute, light. If you're in that mood, you'll likely have a good time.  If you try to take this show too seriously and compare it to other giants.. Well, it wont do as well.  About the actors, I think that they're all pretty good, down to the minor characters.  So all in all, a really good show."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Not even for single moment. Fully engaged and entertained. You will never feel bored not even for a single moment.  I was surprised to see very low rating and I just created new acount to rate it. You can clearly guess I am such a fan.  Can not explain in word. Just see first few episodes.. more you see more interesting it becomes.  Do watch it if you like emotional and rom com.  Well I can not explain the feeling.. This show is actually one of the best of its kind. King The Land is addictive, not because of the popular leads but because of the chemistry they have. Love, comedy, twist, happiness and sweet sadness.. everything is there."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"King the Land has exceeded all of my expectations.  I wasn't going to watch it due to the bad rating but after seen lots of good things being said on FB pages I gave it ago. So pleased I did.  This drama has made me laugh, cry and everything in-between. The leads are great likable characters and the acting was fab. The supporting cast were all worthy characters and no one stood out as a waste. The script was very well written and more real than some. The cinematography was spot on just everything, for me, was brilliant.  The story was pretty much the drama speciaity of high status/low status love but it is done fabulously.  It is a very good drama in my top 5 and I watch another of k dramas. So yep if in doubt don't be it's amazing."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"From the first episode I was totally hooked, the main characters were so believable and the whole series validated the importance of sincerity, honesty and personal integrity. A great advertisement for South Korea and the love story was the cherry on the cake.another feature that I truly enjoyed were the various relationships that were introduced in the story: work, friendships, family ones. There were also intriguing conflicts and some aspects of the corporate world were openly presented. Ambition and self recognition but also antagonistic feelings as well as jealousy within a capitalistic society, were well presented. Humour and a tender sweetness permeated parts of the episodes. On the whole a wonderful entertaining series that filled me with joy and contentment."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"It's a very good lighthearted drama that gives the old kdrama romcom that we missed. The drama may have some cliches buy they also have their own little twists. It's healing in a way and makes you check out of the real world a little bit. It is an easy watch it does not need that much thinking and should not be taken seriously. The chemistry between the two lead is perfection, which is what carried the show for me. They have a mature relationship in the show which. The first two episodes may seem slow but later on the pacing picks up quickly. It also showcased the struggles of different working women in their work environment."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Ignore all the bad reviews. They are overreacting.  If you liked business proposal. You will also love this one.  Ok yes there is no strong story but cute funny romance, no extreme overdramarical scenes. This is a cute drama with a strong lead couple that had a good chemistry together. The kissingscenes were very enjoyable. No awkward kissing scenes. Everything is filmed beautifully. I did not get the sister her character. But that's maybe the only point I didn't like.  It was relaxing watching this drama. If you want a nice relaxing evening with a glass of wine with no over dramatical scenes just watch this.  Try at least a few episodes before making up your mind. If you love corny romantic kdramas you will absolutely love this. If you really need a heavy story and more action. You will hate this. But the reviews are unfair."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,9,,"For anyone... looking for motivation to watch Go for it! Big thumbs up...At first I went with negative reviews...but believe me it's for you to decide, I loved it! The story is basic, but so cute and the details...my God, the travel scenes, cute Little gestures, male leads generosity, to not act narcissistic all the time, not show off or call out anyone, friendship and beautifully articulated story with everybody fitting in exactly the way shown. You will be all smiles throughout the episodes...it would be slow at start...but it just gets better...as good things happen to those who wait..xoxo."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"I am a kdrama fan since 8 years ago,so I think I'm experienced enough to comment truly.  I think this drama is Amazing in everything..actors, chemistry, comedy,story and everything.  I really fell in love with it and i really don't understand this low rating and hate comments.. you know what? Every time you see lots of enemies on your way, sure about that you are doing the greatest.  Let me tell you something if you have doubt in watching it yet. The chemistry between two lead characters and it's comedy is much enough to make you love it, i promise you won't be disappoint.  The chemistry is such a thing that everyone is talking about dating of yoona and junho... you can feel their feelings honestly in every moment they have together and it makes my stomach butterflies fly."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"I'm glad I didn't check the rating before diving into this Korean TV series. It's a true gem, impeccably crafted, overflowing with romance interspersed with unexpected and thrilling twists, exactly as a romantic story should be. It's an absolute delight from start to finish, guaranteed to elevate your dopamine levels with its addictive and heartwarming romance. I'm genuinely surprised by the low IMDb rating. When you consider the opinions of various viewers, it unquestionably deserves at least an 8. The direction and editing are top-notch, and the protagonist's charisma grows with each episode.  One aspect I particularly enjoyed was the overarching theme of wealth and opulence. In a world where many series and movies often explore themes of calamity, poverty, lack, sadness, and fear, this series stands out. It's a perfect mental reset after a long day, offering a surreal journey filled with hope, prosperity, opportunities, happiness, love, and friendship. If you're looking to unwind and escape into a world of positivity, this series is a must-watch."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"I can't believe the bad reviews. I don't watch Korean tv normally but this show is amazing. Are there cheesy moments, absolutely, but have you seen the state of American tv? The bad reviews must be bots or paid trolls. You can't help but love this show. I'm completely mesmerized by King The Land. It's adorable and the cinematography is refreshingly unique. If you're looking to experience a tiny bit of new culture this show is perfect. The actors do a great job. It's a wonderful escape from reality. The reviews are required to be so long. No wonder all those trolls come on here, just to vent in a minimum of 600 words. It's a great show."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"I love how it surprises you when they deviate from the typical kdrama tropes. Refreshing, LOL-ed moments, some drama but it never takes itself too seriously. And a swoonworthy couple chemistry ( mainly the alpha vibes from Lee Jun Ho). I found it lighter and better paced than better known Kdramas. Fair amount of product placement. There's heart fluttering rom, there's com, there's eye candy... there's unusual characters and wonderful friendships, and one wishes they show a bit more of real life in the couple's journey but the work drama will fill in for that for now. I don't get the hate . It was never marketed as a serious show!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"At first, I didn't want to watch this drama because of the bad reviews and how everyone thought it wasn't good after the release of the first 3 episodes.  But I want to say this; THIS IS A GREAT DRAMA AND A MUST WATCH!!!! I'm a sucker for romantic dramas and this by far exceeded my expectations. You can feel the chemistry between the Female and Male leads. And if you have somewhat of a hotel experience, you will notice most of the scenes portray what happens in a hotel setting especially from an employee perspective. All the cast of this drama are great actors, I didn't notice any cast who didn't portray the right emotions whether it was sadness, betrayal, genuine friendship, loyalty, love. I also wasn't expecting the male lead to have a genuine kind nature, everything he did felt really personal to him regardless of the reason. I honestly can't wait to see the final two episodes.  I don't usually write reviews but I think this drama is deserving of it. The cast and crew has put in so much effort, it wouldn't be fair to them to discredit their efforts with 1 star reviews because some people watched the drama with a shallow mindset.  Watch the drama with an open mind, feel the love, happiness, genuine friendship this drama brings to you and write a review of worthy of it so the ratings can go up and the people who have put in so much effort to bring this drama to life can see the reward of their hard work 💪💪💪💪"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,1,,"I watched it because it was the top 1 tv shows. But I couldn't get pass through episode 2. 40 minutes of the show and it was already cringe. The comedy was too forced and corny.  I loved Junho in The Red Sleeve but definitely not in this one. YoonA is still the same mediocre actress who lacks facial expressions. Good thing they're both good looking but both of them had zero chemistry at all.  If I could rate this a little more than 1, I would. I can't believe I spent my precious hours trying to watch it.  Lesson learned: Just because a drama and the actors in it are popular doesn't mean it's good."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Honestly, I was not expecting myself to get obsessed with a drama at this extent. I randomly started watching it in the morning while having coffee, and called in sick to the office just to finish 14 episodes in a single day. I was obsessed with it. Not a fan of k-dramas. But this series was so refreshing, genuine, well acted, with best dialogues, full of emotions with a comedy edge- all Was just perfect. The way all characters have been developed, and the series is paced, it was just bang on. Absolutely loved it. Everyone has acted well. Gradual changes of the lead character are pleasant. Overall, it gives you hopes and good lovely vibes.  Surprise and shocked to see the negative comments- unbelievable!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"IT HAS EVERYTHING! Before I start writing further ,I apologize if I am writing the review in incorrect grammar and if I offend anyone I am sorry. Also I am writing this review in my perspective , so if there are any false info about this drama please forgive me . Now let us begin... I mean from the story line to the visuals to the acting. OMG!!!! I know everyone who is reading this review will either agree and be happy or disagree and have their own opinions, which I totally understand and respect. But for those who are interested in this DRAMA(I am so excited to write this review right now:)) let me tell you! Alright so from the first ep itself it is quite interesting, funny and a wholesome drama to watch. Right now I just finished watching ep.13 and I am excitingly waiting for ep.14 to air. So far I am very satisfied with the story line , visuals and the ACTING! (HAPPY AAH)  In this k drama, it has of course, romance, friendship, sadness and learning some valuable lessons. This drama teaches us to have fun with friends and yourself while also telling us that it's OKAY to cry when you are just not feeling it. There was this one scene in ep.13 which I really liked and supported. It was about Gu Won(Lee Jun Ho) telling his nephew (whom he had not spent much time with before)to cry when he is not fine and to be expressive and be open with his emotions overall. Also I like that there are children involved in this drama because it also portrays how the children feels when they are happy and sad. The adults also give advices and plays with the children in this drama and therefore making it a wholesome drama as I mentioned earlier. If I say further I think you will not feel like watching the drama so I will end my review here. Wait! There are some more things I need to tell you. So Lee Jun ho(Gu Won) and Im Yoonah(Cheon Sarang)have a spectacular chemistry on and off screen. I am watching this drama in Kissasian. Hope these few words were helpful and enjoy watching the drama!!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"This is what I expect from a kdrama. Good romance and a good comedy, loved the characters. This show may not be a masterpiece but it's a real kdrama.  With that I really do not understand the low rating for this great show. I only voted 10 stars because of the low rating. It's probably disappointing for the actresses to see this and may cause to cancel the show. If you want to watch it and you are not sure about it because of the rating, don't worry about that and just watch it. You won't regret it. I hope they don't cancel this so we can get a proper ending we deserve. Enjoy..................."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"This show is good. It shows perfect chemistry of the two main leads. The plot, romance all of it is good and it deserves the recognition it should get. It's a complete blend of business proposal + whats wrong with secretary kim in addition to its own plot. The vibe and atmosphere is truly very good and i enjoy this show very much. I wait every weekend just to watch this show. I cant wait to see what happens next. The two actors have good chemistry on the show and in behind the scene as well. It's very good to see a show with them as main leads. I can't wait to see more episodes. The romance, comedy is very good."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"If you've never seen a kdrama before then you can't fully appreciate how wonderful this show is. It's an instant kdrama classic, follows the usual tropes but in a fun way that you'll definitely enjoy! This one's truly for the seasoned kdrama fan. There's so many funny moments that I really didn't expect from this, it's such a good time!  The lead actors are hilarious and yoona is perfect as always.  Expect silly moments, typical kdrama tropes but in a modernised way. This truly is a feel good show and will scratch that kdrama itch. Don't listen to the review bombers, it was clearly strategic for whatever reason."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,8,,"I cannot understand the review bombing, it's shameful that any show or movie on here can be review bombed or the very opposite. It's a form of propaganda & disinformation. Surely IMDb have to somehow protect from this happening time & time again.  King the Land is a joy to watch. It's heartfelt with nearly every character so likeable.  The leads have great chemistry, the supporting cast too.  The visuals and settings are gorgeous. The entire production flawless technically. Everything in the show is beautiful.  South Korea's investment directive in Entertainment in the 2000's are really paying off.  Most productions are enticing, promote their country, people and cultures so very well, even including Thailand this time.  I enjoyed this series and recommend it to those who want a hopeful, stress-free series.  The respect for elders is always so appreciated in K-dramas. The Grandmother in King the Land is my absolute favourite.  The funny sidekick was endearing too. Both great talented actors.  I could perhaps do without the silly sound effects for the humour scenes but that's just a nitpick preference.  I hope you watch the entire series and thoroughly enjoy it as much as I did."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"This is one of the iconic romantic K dramas in a long time. No sad ending, beautiful chemistry between the lead actors and amazing acting by Junho and Yoona.  Totally loved how their story unfolds and how they fall in love with each other, harder with each passing day.  Junho's character is the best, the ideal man , the way he loves his lady, can do anything to protect her, he's intelligent and so handsome. Became a Junho fan after watching this drama for sure.  Yoona has played her character really well, the acting, the comic timing, the way she supports her love and loves her work and is a loyal employee to the hotel."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"This series is absolutely remarkable! It flawlessly combines all the essential elements for a thoroughly enjoyable watch. The main characters are fantastic, and the supporting actors complement them perfectly. The plot twists, drama, action, intense romance, friendship, hardships, and difficult relationships are all masterfully executed, evoking a wide range of emotions. Humour adds a delightful touch to the overall splendour of the show. I was so engrossed that I watched the entire series with subtitles in just one day. The acting is top-notch, and the undeniable spark and energy between the two main characters on screen make it an unforgettable experience."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"The 90s was the era of the best romcoms ever produced because they stay true to their plot, boy meets girl, fall in love, work through their relationship (with a bunch of goofy friends) and live happily ever after. I had since avoided romcoms like plague (especially in kdramas) mainly because none of the romcoms produced after that gave me the same light hearted, fluttery feelings that I love from the 90s romcoms. King of the Land is the first romcom (k drama) I watched after only staying in horror/crime mystery genres for almost 15 yrs. And boy am I not disappointed. This series gave me the nostalgic feelings of the 90s romcoms. It's like the blend of some of the greatest 90s romcoms (I can think of Notting Hill and Pretty Woman specifically). Romcoms rely greatly on the chemistry of the leads. I've only seen LJH in one crime mystery series Confession (pretty good) and Lim YoonA in Confidential Assignment (which was meh to me), so I was pleasantly surprised to find the insane chemistry between them and that is literally what made this series the best romcom for me. I don't need complicated mystery in my romcoms, what I need to see is the growth of the characters while they work out the kinks in their romantic relationship and this series has that a plenty. The goofy friends, the romantic holiday and the banters among them are all the necessary elements needed for a perfect romcom. If you want some nostalgic feelings of the 90s romcoms, put this in your watch list."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"I've said this in other platform and I will say it all over again. KTL is the best romcom kdrama I've encountered so far and I've been into kdramas since 2010. The plot is light and fun, no unnecessary drama or toxic relationship/friendship, no angsty couple whatsoever. This drama gave me hope of how a healthy and mature relationship would look like and does exist in real life. And I think all of the cast is a scene stealer, not only Junho and Yoona. And you guys should also watch the BTS episodes, it's like we are watching another free romcom :)) I would definitely rewatch it again in the future as KTL has become my comfort drama."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"I stand by my statement. Basically all kdramas are the same, so why hate on this one?  The cinematography is amazing, the production was great, the actors did well, famous or not.  Each did their jobs. The leads were glorious, the evil sister was so hateful, you wanted to boo each time she was on the screen, the goofy assistant was funny, the girlfriends were loyal. What more can you ask for!  As for the story, well they are all basically the same, except in different venues. I liked that this one spoke up for all those that work hard in their respective labors sometimes for little recognition or reward.  Stop hating something that has been working for so long. This was a good watch!!!!!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Not sure why people are hating on this. It's cute. And any comments about being predictable, have you ever seen a Hallmark movie?!? We all know what is going to happen and we watch anyway. I'm in episode 5 and plan to finish the series. It is cute, give it a go. I wonder if someone with the set offended somebody and that's why they are getting low stars. The storyline so far is cute, nothing cringy, see some areas where they will add some backstory (they all have this right) :-) and some holes so far that they are eluding to. I've never seen these actors, but will view their other works. Hope you give it a try,"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Loving the two leads - their chemistry is so palpable. They look so great together, too. I loved how their relationship developed and that he was the one to realize he liked her first. It was fun to see!  Storyline is interesting to see all the hard work that goes into running a hotel. Some of the characters are super annoying and shameless, but the rest of the cast's interactions make up for those bad apples.  Just watched the 100 year anniversary episode and found all the speeches very touching and made the event special and personal.  Looking forward to seeing the rest of the episodes. I cannot wait!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"I'm not a Korean drama fan, but I can't believe how addicted I am to the show. I watched it all the way through and can't get enough. I agree it was a bit cringe, but most shows nowadays have varying degrees of cringingness.  What I like about the show is its light and easy nature - it makes you feel loved, happy, warm-hearted, and relaxed. Life is already hard enough, so why watch something difficult? This show makes perfect sense to me after a long day of work.  The actings of the characters are all doing a good job. The leads of the characters have so much chemistry make you wonder whether they are lovers in real life. Overall I would recommend the show."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,9,,"Why is this drama so low-rated?? I laughed at every episode.  This drama is perfect to spend a good time and improve your mood. And appart from having a very good sense of humour, it has a good plot where you can see the evolution of the characters: a woman who follows her dreams and passes from cleaning the ""ass sweat"" 😂 of the gym machines of the hotel where she starts working to own her own hotel plenty of ""smiles""; and an inmature man full of traumas who turns into an admirable hotel leader.  It was one of the best comedy romance drama I have seen.  P. S.: It gave me the same vibes as 'What's wrong with secretary Kim?' and 'Business Proposal'."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"This drama is really fun to watch. Yes, some scene may have been clichè but this is still a great thing to watch. It's very relaxing. Jun-ho and yoonah's chemistry is great, even the side cast are really good. Especially, Manager Noh! He's really funny.  I love the jealous Gu-won though. I really like his character development.  Some of the comments are not good, and its because they did not even try to finish it. The story begins to be more funny and interesting in the later episodes. And the romantic moments is <3  So if you want to watch a relaxing drama that will make a great mood for you, try this one."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,9,,"I've watched so many dramas and King the Land's comedic references and slapstick scenes reminded me of why i fell in love with K dramas in the first place!  The drama is lighthearted and Junho and Yoona need to win best couple award / best kiss scene for their amazing acting and onscreen/ offscreen chemistry!  While indeed there are flaws in the script writing and poor research done for referencing the Prince Samirs episodes, it is totally understandable why people are upset by the casting and distortion of culture. I believe the production team will do better in future and learn from their mistakes.  Overall the actors are doing so well and couldn't have asked for a more lighthearted summer kdrama!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,9,,"As Episode 8 ends and leans into a more serious romance, one cannot help but respect the emotional journey the two actors, Jun-Ho and Yoona, take their audience on what is a private moment in the storyline. I could feel their heartbeats with the intensity of their acting. I wonder how many times that scene will be replayed by a global audience. I've been on sets and this is not an easy scene to pull off - there are dozens of people feet away from them causing distractions, it's a hot set with electricity and water and then they have to do something intimate when they might not know each other very well. (The director may not have recorded the scenes in order of how their story unfolds.) I did chuckle at the ""asking permission"" - it's a respectful moment in a relationship, of course, but somewhere out there a Human Resources professional watching is saying - thank goodness.  #Jun-HoHeartbeatsforYoona."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,2,,"If you're into ""aegyo"" and/or yoona's fan then you'll enjoy this show. I'm not interested in either one so I didn't like show at all. Personally, i cannot tolerate aegyo so i may be biased. But i tried for something new. It was too much aegyo for me to handle. And so corny/cheesy.  They def copied many ideas from the other Nerflix show, Business Proposal, yet nothing like it. Cant even compare Average acting. A boring plot. This show is made for the main girl.  The only reason I added another star was bc I like the other 2 girls, and there were a couple of funny moments. This show isn't for me."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,9,,"Much-needed Respite ""King The Land"" is, from heavy- and dark-genre dramas, with lovable FeMale-protagonists from primary-to-secondary.  Villains are within-Family, so Reconciliation is highly-Anticipated.  To add to the Mayhem of Hotelier-business are the quaint-Character/s from showbiz asking for Conveniences, the Middle Eastern-guest so--enamored w/ the Most-Talented-Personnel @Concierge~wanting to marry her even, the Mishaps of Public-Relation to increase King Hotel-patronages, etc-relevant for Hilarity.  Incredible stunt-actings, too and impeccable Changes of characterizations towards LOVE.  There's the crescendo of Conflict up ahead with the sudden information, re: Heir-apparent, Chairman's son marriage-of-convenience, according to High Society-standards.  What heartbreak it must be for the star-crossed in- a-relationship, yet gotta Move-On and Forward.  Overall, it's been a Refreshing-journey, so far, proving that when the REALity kicks in about 2'people-in-Love and are Fated?  Can't stand in the way of it!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,This show was 10001 drama that i was waiting! All the role was amazing. And every episode i was dying laugh for like real. And of course the love line was very cringe and it's makes me think that there are really in love together in real life. I'm satisfied on this drama as I was very a long time didn't watch a kdrama. It's really bring me the old kdrama vibes tho! I love it.  It's something light drama that you can follow when you was stress. Recommended!!!! Please give a lot of love and support them! And yes they both idol on 2gen. SNSD and 2PM! It's was my korean group on my era.  Keep support!
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"This is so sweet. I live all the characters, they accept life's setbacks with determination to not let it liaise their zest for life and the pursuit of happiness. I love the storyline and the interactions between the grandmother and her future grandson in law. I really like how grandma makes it seem like she does not approve yet shows his kindness in a grumpy way. I really liked the Samhair character and gu interactions. Like two friends who always compete over everything. I always look forward to saturdays and sundays just so I can see the next episode and end my weekend with a smile. Such a fun show."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Such a nice romance for a change !  Sure nothing new or incredibly original (what is original today) but it gives so much joy every episode.  Juhno and Yoona are great, the acting is nice and refreshing. The chemistry and the visuals are off the chart with these two. It's so nice to see them acting together after knowing each other for 15 years.  I love all the secondary caracters, they are so funny !  It's just a lot of fun, a light romantic comedy that won't give you a headache.  Overall, a great show that you must watch if you like Korean romantic comedy.  Don't listen to the negative reviews, they are organised trolls."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"I watch this show from episode 1 to 8. I love this series. It's a light romcom and I really enjoy it. Both main leads have a good chemistry. And the supporting cast is enjoyable to watch. I need the ML to start fighting her evil sister. Yes, it's a cliche romcom but this type of drama that makes my heart fluttering. It's make me forget all the problems at works. Its been a long time I've watch this kind of drama since nowadays k-drama always produce makjang, bullying and heavy genre. To see they produce this kind of drama (romcom) again, it was a relieved. I will probably have to rewatch this drama again. If you not down with this kind of genre maybe this one is not for you."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,2,,"I love Lee Jun Ho and Lim Yoona but This show has broken the rule that the first 4 episodes are the best in Korean drama.  -Painfully expected from the first sec.  it can be an example of a bad script so that we can teach young scriptwriters why this plot and storyline are horrible.   This drama will survive only because the main actors are charismatic and have tons of fans.     If you want to watch something when you're at the dentist, or you want to rest from work, something like a bad fast food meal, or of course if you're a teenager, you will love this drama.  -Waste of money, Time, and Efforts of hundreds of people."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,9,,"As a dedicated Junho follower, of course I have to watch this. I agree that the beginning of the series was pretty terrible. But it is starting to find its way now, as both his and Yoona's characters are pretty firmly established, and we can see that he is going to have to prove himself to drag the Hotel into this century. He is the fresh blood and approach that is needed. He understands that the Hotel is more than a building - it's the spirit of endeavor. Its success, or failure, depends on all of the people who are the dedicated underpinnings of the venture - the staff.  On a side note - sort of - I can really understand why Junho took this role. The Red Sleeve was a ""Super Nova"",and cannot be easily repeated. The best remedy was something light and fun. This man likes to WORK. So, laying around waiting for a prize winning script to show up was a ""waste of time"" (listen to some of his song lyrics).  But the Bonanza in this show, is Yoona. I'm also an amateur astrologer. He, the Aquarius, is perfectly matched with Yoona, the Gemini. Their charts line up very well. Since they were born only a few months apart, in many ways, they mirror each other. So, my suggestion to them is....... take excellent advantage of this time together. You two can light up the world - together. Go For It. One thing that I noticed about them together in this show, is that they both seemed genuinely happy together. I think they might be sending us a subtle message!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,Love the show I just love it. I love the chemistry that these two have. I have watched quite a few K dramas and the kiss scenes we're just so cringy lol.  Yes the storyline is similar to a lot of other shows however I really could care less about that!  It's probably because I'm a Lee Jun ho fan :)  In all honesty though for me this is definitely a binge-worthy show. I have found it very addicting. I haven't completed it yet because at this moment only up to episode 9 has aired. Yes I am patiently waiting for number 10 to come out which should be in a few hours!!!!!!!  Anyways. It gets my 10 stars!
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Just loved it👌👌 This series is one of the most beautiful romance series I have seen to date. Simple and captivating until the last minute. And always waiting for more and more. It is of an enormous delicacy. The characters make everything so much more beautiful and real. It simply makes you dream...after all, there are still real stories like this out there.... I think the concept is excellent and I never thought I would grab onto a story like this series portrays. To make a good story you just have to be simple and convey all the greatness that with it, the characters did it in the best way. You are all to be congratulated!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"I have seen the work of both ML and FL in previous dramas and movies they both are amazing in their own way. But this series makes me love them even more. Their gestures, their eyes contact, smiles for each other had protrayed very nicely. How the storyline build up from haters to lovers and how they had find their way for each other is something astounding. I am totally loving it. And every Saturday and Sunday has been kind the land day. Thank you for your amazing work. And believe me with every episode you will fall in love with Jun ho. He is absolutely amazing and nevertheless yoona is fabulous."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,9,,"This has such a low IMDB rating I was at a loss to know why, especially since similar K dramas have +7 and +8 ratings.  Let's face it, this plot and story have been done before. It is almost identical to some other K dramas: Poor girl meets rich guy. They fall in love despite all odds and opposition.  So what is the problem? None for me. I enjoyed in spite of all that. Gu Won is handsome and successful. Sa-rang is beautiful with a drop dead smile. Ms. Gu is the evil half-sister. Mr. No is comic relief, and the ""six siblings"" carry the show.  We almost didn't watch because of the low rating but we are glad we did."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"This kdrama is so cute and interesting (romantic too). I love this drama. No wonder why it was on no.1 on netflix in 2023. I've watched it like 30 times. I want everyone to watch this kdrama. This drama is excellent. You should watch it too!!🦋. Have you watched this kdrama? It's fabulous and gorgeous. It was on top 10 for straight eight weeks since its release. I hope this kdrama have a second season. Who agrees with me? I hope if you are reading this, you have watched the drama but if not, then I hope you will watch it. It is really amazing. I fully recommend this kdrama. If you had not watched it, please go watch it because everyone else did. It's just beautifully amazing and romantic. I recommend this kdrama from my heart!!✨"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,8,,"King the Land is a delightful rom-com that successfully balances humor, heartwarming moments, and a touch of drama. Yoona and Junho's chemistry is undeniable, their playful banter and growing affection captivating the screen. While the plot is predictable, it's the characters' development and the charming portrayal of love that truly shines. The supporting cast adds depth and humor, making the series an enjoyable watch. However, some might find the pacing slow at times. Overall, ""King the Land"" is a feel-good drama that leaves you with a smile, making it a perfect choice for a lighthearted escape."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,8,,"This k-drama has its share of cliches, but with fresh angles. The lead actor and actress have chemistry together and are adorable individually.  The female lead has self-respect and takes pride in her work. The show touches on class differences and challenging relationships with superiors at work.  The male lead is open to learning from his love interest. The battle with his half-sister for the company is less of a battle and more of his sister's unfounded suspicions of her brother.  I am in the middle of episode 7, and I happened to check IMDB to find information on the lead actor and actress. I was shocked to see a rating of 2 and felt I needed to write a review.  Granted, the characterization and conflict is not very deep, but it's a fluffy, wholesome, feel-good rom-com. I find it worth my time!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Having just discovered the richness and variety of Korean drama and romantic comedy, how lucky am I to have found this right out of the box!  The story is a charming, contemporary fairy-tale that is uplifting and positive, despite the roadblocks the hero and heroine stumble across along the way. The entire cast is talented and competently handles some fine, laugh-out-loud comedic turns as well a few teary moments. The writing is excellent all the way through, and nothing seems to have been spared in the way of production values as the sets and settings are splendid.  Trying to analyze what make this series stand out from the many others, I believe it is the finely calibrated balance of romance, comedy and the redemptive power of love combined with very attractive leads (Lee Junho and Lim Yoona are not conventionally ""pretty"" but definitely charismatic) and a strong supporting cast. Plus the soundtrack is mesmerizing.  I hated for it to end and have watched the entire series several times now. Hopefully, the creators are busy creating something equally as wonderful and will gift us soon.  Don't want to be greedy but...more, please!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"I don't understand the poor ratings for this show. The first few episodes are a bit slow in progression but once the storyline started movie, it's an attention capturing show. I don't know if these reviews are being intentionally spammed with hate reviews, but to anyone who hasn't watched, try watching past the first few episodes and I promise you'll want to keep going.  The chemistry between the leads is so natural. The secondary storylines keep you guessing and wanting more. The plot can be predictable at times but the episode cliff hangers always have you second guessing your assumptions.  It's been a captivating series that's has had me laughing and crying and rooting for the underdog. It's wholesome tv that's entertaining and I appreciate it."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,8,,"Yes according to some western standards it has overacting and a predictable plot... but it's nice to watch and bserve the cultural differences with our society and ways of working... I watched it with pleasure for that reason... it's a kind of Korean Cinderella version... All the standard plot ingredients are there including an evil stepsister (?) ... at the same time some of grandma's food I would love to try myself... The young couple play it cool... the series also touches on fundamental issues of live... work/life balance, what can a boss or hotel guest ask you to do or not, where 's the line between service or personal integrity... So, you may warch it as an ordinary simple Korean sitcom like series... or you observe a new generation trying to find out what part of the culture needs to be innovated..."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS DRAMA! I am a loyal fan of Lee Jun Ho and watch everything he stars in. I enjoyed every moment of this Kdrama from start to finish and don't understand the low rating.  The acting, cinematography, storyline and directing were top notch. It is a genuine rom-com with elements of both clearly interspersed in the storyline. The concept of justice and equity for all workers regardless of station was addressed by the ML, Gu Won (played by Lee Jun Ho) and carried through to the finish. His love for the Cheon Sarang (played by Im Yoon-Ah) was steady and sure. Needless to say, I shed tears of joy as I watched their romance develop and grow.  Kudos to all associated with this production. Give this show a watch; it's a great story!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Warning: this is one of the best series ever!!!  I just like everything in this serie, the actors ( love them!!), the script, the chemistry between the actors, the friendship they are really there for each other.  It's funny and romantic.  I'm happy every time when it's Sunday evening so I can watch 2 episodes again.  Normally I don't add a review, but this time I had to because of the haters and there bad rates!!!!  They are the amateurs and have really bad taste.  Just keep on making this perfect serie, can't wait until the next episode reveals!!!!!  I hope you make many more seasons of ""King the Land""  And I will watch them all !!! Only love for this serie !!!!!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,3,,"The early episodes were unbearable to watch. I've noticed that the writer and the production team are trying to make the drama comical, but the comedy is a hit-or-miss. For me, it's sadly a miss. I find it cringe and forced.  Beside the comedy, I also don't like the fact that our main leads always seem to be ""accidentally"" in the same place, at the same time: Standing basically two meters away from each other at the hotel lobby AND THEN walking away at the same time just for the sake of the slow-mo effect without noticing one another.       In 2023, I thought we already went past that cliché. I can tolerate if they do it maybe once in a while, but in each episode? I'm not sure.  It is truly disappointing since out of all the upcoming dramas, I was looking forward to King the Land the most. I trusted Lee Jun Ho and Yoona, but now I'm questioning their judgement on this.  I end up dropping this series after episode five. I really do hope that the upcoming episodes will be better than the previous ones tho cause there's a chance I might want to pick it back up in the future. And if in any way, you find this drama enjoyable, I'm happy for you :) It is just not for me now."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"If you want to watch the show but are not watching seeing the ratings, then you are missing out something so beautiful and magical.  The ratings are low because of the outburst of some controversy, but king the land is the second most watched show of Netflix this year and also one of the highest rated kdrama in paid channel jtbc.  The drama from start to end gives butterflies in your stomach. The chemistry between lee junho and Lim yoona is the highlight of this drama, their chemistry is fire, you won't be able to take your eyes off them.  Watch king the land, you will never regret itit at all."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"This is my first Korean serie since I stopped my obsession with it last year. And I am so in love with this! There is so much humor, I laughed out loud multiple times per episode. And I'm really loving the storyline, the characters, how they develop during the serie. And I was so surprised by the level of intimacy, normally when there is kissing it feels like not natural, the girl not ook participating with it. But here they just go for it, touching, kissing etc. It gives me butterflies every time. This is really a must see! I have to finish the serie, I have to more episodes to go but I'm really sad to know it is almost finished...."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"I had seen this pop up in my Netflix for a while, and was hesitant but curious due to the poor reviews, rarely dramas I watch score much below 8! But this easily competes with the best of them. A heart warming feel good story with great simple messaging throughout. The lead characters are well developed, with excellent chemistry. As with all Kdramas the storyline is a little predictable, but that's why we watch them! The feel good vibes! Overall another fantastic series that leaves you sad to see it end. Possibly even one to rewatch again!  I wouldn't rate this solidly a 9/10, but giving it a 10 to help boost the reviews as it doesn't deserve such a low score."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Amazing. The story evolve at a great pace and humour is funny and sweet. I really don't understand the bad reviews at all. I've seen way worst than this amazing serie top 10 on Netflix. This one is a hit, particular in his genre. I think it's worth to give it a try if it's not usually your type of humour. It deserve his chance. Great time to spent watching a nice and cozy serie with your lover or alone (you may feel lonely lol your are advise). My husband and I absolutely love it ! We have good laughs here and there. I like that this serie is very clean. Definitely will watch something similar if possible!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,8,,"This one is a romance through and through, as sweet as it gets, with very good looking actors. What was nice to see was the unwavering emotions despite of social disparity. I liked that the FL was not some damsel in distress, always waiting to be rescued, she had a full personality and had faith in her abilities. The friendship between the FL and her friends was heartwarming. I also got to know a lot about the people working in the hospitality sector, and how their jobs seem to be so much more than we see in the surface.  Overall, I enjoyed watching the series, the actors were super good looking and had great chemistry, I've watched Lim Yoona in K2 before but this was my first time seeing Lee Junho, and he didn't fail to impress either. I look forward to more series with these two as the lead pair!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"It's a series with a lot of cliches yes, but it is very reminiscent of the early days rom-coms, and it is done so much better in terms of acting and production! And it just gets better episode by episode.  The chemistry between the leads are amazing! If that is your kind of thing then you definitely do not want to miss this. I have watched Korean dramas for over 15 years and I have not seen chemistry like this before.  I commend the production crew and cast for a job well done, it is clear that a lot of effort went into this production, and overall it is a really enjoyable watch.  It is really great for rewatching as well!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,1,,"""King the Land"" is a TV series that fails to deliver on its promises of engaging storytelling and talented performances. With a recycled and unoriginal plot, viewers are subjected to a monotonous narrative that offers nothing new or captivating. The actors' lackluster performances only add to the disappointment, as they fail to bring depth or authenticity to their characters. The pacing is inconsistent, dragging the already tiresome story further. The production quality is subpar, with cheap sets and a lack of attention to detail. Overall, ""King the Land"" is an uninspiring series that lacks creativity and fails to make any impact. Save your time and seek out more deserving and original shows."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"If you're looking for a show with drama, love and fun ... King the Land is it! I find myself looking forward to the weekend to watch the next 2 episodes. It's my fave summer series. The ensemble cast is great! A smart and gracious female lead (Sa-rang). The male lead's character has traumatic past and finds his way forward (Gu Won). The support cast adds additional story lines (but not too much) and provides levity in all the right places. Gu Won's personal assistant has over-the-top antics. He's just plain fun to watch. The electricity between the 2 main characters sizzles! This show is meant to be a lighthearted, summertime indulgence. Enjoy! I sure do!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,1,,"The show has zero originality it's the worst show I have ever seen it's a waste of Time I want my time back it Contains abuse Unfortunately not worth being in top 10 The writer and director produced a failed work that does not deserve a minute of the viewer's time The story is very trivial, there is nothing in it that will get bored from the first second the show was so cringy they tried to add some funny clips but it was so cringey i felt like i wanted to cry instead of laugh.the comedy was forced nothing was natural. I don't feel sorry for actors either they have read the script and they agreed on it."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Decided to watch the drama bcos it's Romcom and also curious of LeeJunHo or Yoona. And i have not watched any drama from both of them ever since i started to watch kdramas since 2018. But already heard about them bcos duh they are idols. Hehe  So far i enjoy the kdrama and it's funny, of course so many cute moments. But mostly, i always laugh bcos of the typical clichés in every kdrama romantic series.  I guess that's what this kdrama wants to show the audience, every typical cliché are put into it. Hehe But i don't find it cringe, i find it so funny that i always laugh at it.  Guess if you just want something to make ur night fun, cute, and no worries. Then this kdrama is a must. Sometimes i love to watch romcoms that are not to heavy on the storyline just a chill show where i can enjoy it and feel good and happy after every episode.  Yes the ML is having issues with his family but in this kdrama, it's not really something they focus on. But who knows, it's still on ep10 though. But i have a feeling this drama will just end on a happy and light feeling.  Must watch if you just want something bright, fun and cute. This kdrama will really put a smile on ur face even with all the clichés. Hehe  This kdrama is my happy pill right now from all the stress in my daily life. ;)  And bcos of this kdrama, I'm now a fan of LeeJunHo and Yoona <3."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"After not going to watch because I figured using a K POP singer as lead was a gimmick (yes I know suzy) And now having watched 9 Chapters I am a total believer even though her parts are not hard mostly facial (smiles) she has a way of endearing herself to the viewer, I also question why they had to promote her so fast I think leaving her at first couple of levels would have been totally great and more believable, Hell if I could smile just to become head of anything I would smile away.  The absence at least so far of Hating Parents, and love triangles has been a God send, Dont need another Something In The Rain drama only to ruin it with such nonsense At least in the U. S. we dont go for Parents like that or Stalkers that YOU keep around, still mad at that drama.  Ok back at the Second leads not too much so far on their developments hope that this drama stays on line no surprise Murders, stalkers,Parents, Amnesia, etc Is it worth watching Damn Right."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Honestly the actors put much more effort in it thees program then american or europian actors now days. I think they are really good. This is the first ever korean moovie what i watched and i did not even know that Joona and yunho existed till now so i do not like it because of their previous works. I like it because it is refreshing. Netflix is full of rabish most of the time but King the Land remind us values like honesty, purity, trust and traditions. Things those are important. Yes it is a bit oldschool and strange and slow but i think this is mostly because korea has got different cultur. And i love it as it is. It is conforting like chockolate, a good pasta or noodles. Do not expect more or something extrem or anything new but enjoy the happynes what it gives you as you enjoy eating the good old chockolet over and over again even it alwayse taste the same."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"I honestly don't understand why the other people in the comment were criticizing it so harshly. This show isn't that bad, it's even a good show worth watching. The plot of the series, its progression, the performance of the actors and the realistic scenes are great! It beats many TV series with similar themes. It will undoubtedly be in my favorite Asian dramas! I want to see more of these players. I'm sure you will think the same thing when you watch the series! Especially those romantic scenes~ Who sees this review, don't be fooled by the other reviews and give this series a try. You will not regret it!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,9,,"Yes, King the Land it's that cliché that never fails to make us fall in love over and over again with it! If you are into this genre, this is a must watch!  The male lead it's a chaebol who can't really socialize with other people and don't really like to see others with their fake smiles, but he's the kind of guy who can't stand seeing others receiving unfair treatment just because they aren't rich, and I think this is his best charm... Being fair and not being rude despite having money and a difficult personality (yes, we all know most of kdramas with this plot have a male lead acting so rude in most situations before fall in love with the female lead)  The female lead is a character that different from many female leads in this genre, is someone who fights for her career and put lots of efforts in giving her best, but without saying yes to everything and accepting wrong things easily! Her personality is so good!  The couple lead has absolutely the best chemistry and are providing one of the best romances we could see! And yes, it's a cliché romcom so it's made for those who really like this gente or those who just want something more lighthearted to watch!  And one of the strongest points of this kdrama it's that they really develop not just the main characters but all the other ones, really giving them detailed plots and motivations, and this allows us to relate with them too!  I'm enjoying and the whole cast it's really talented and worth it of a chance!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"This drama is so good. The chemistry between the main leads is insane, their acting gave me butterflies to my stomach. There are even times that the scenes feel so realistic that I feel that the actors are not acting anymore because of how perfectly they portrayed their characters as a couple in this drama.  Even though it got low ratings here due to its issue in episode 7, I still highly recommend this korean drama especially if you are a fun of romantic comedy series. This drama gets better and better each episode that can make you kick in the air because of the unstoppable chemistry between the main leads.  Also, this kdrama is a fictional story that can give you comfort after a tiring day."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"If I could give a hundred stars.. I definitely would.  King the Land is super amazing.  I super love and appreciate every single thing the King the Land team put together to produce this movie.  The cast gave in their best and I could literally feel every emotions and moments of each scene. So real!  The friendship between the girls kinda reflects the friendship I share with my two best friends (although we've long graduated from school and facing life in different cities away from each other, (one is married with a kid) but we still keep in touch every time and always there for each other)  I also admire the work relationship/ friendship between the male lead and his secretary, It's so Fun & WOW!!  And a big SHOUT OUT to YoonA and Lee Jun ho, they both nailed their parts with their friendship, skills and chemistry. They made my heart flutter with each scene.  King the Land is one of my favorite rom-com I would watch over and over again."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"This is a feel good show. It may not be original but it's cute and adorable, and watching the love grow between the two leads is just heartwarming. I am enjoying every minute so far. It's been sweet, funny, and I have enjoyed the stories of the side characters as well. I love the grandma and the flight attendants. We are just ten episodes in and I am expecting something terrible to happen soon, but I hope they will find a way to support each other and stick it out. It's not believable but it's not meant to be that way. It's just a sweet show about falling in love. And as such, it hits the spot."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Such a nice romance for a change! Sure nothing new or incredibly original (what is original today) but it gives so much joy every episode. Juhno and Yoona are great, the acting is nice and refreshing. The chemistry and the visuals are off the chart with these two. It's so nice to see them acting together after knowing each other for 15 years. I love all the secondary caracters, they are so funny! It's just a lot of fun, a light romantic comedy that won't give you a headache. Overall, a great show that you must watch if you like Korean romantic comedy. Don't listen to the negative reviews, they are organised trolls."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Junho is superb in this drama. It is sweet and endearing as the romance unfolds. The scenes between Junho and Yoona have me smiling from ear to ear because the chemistry between him and Yoona is fabulous!!!!! Anticipate each episode!! The story line is simplistic so far (boy meets girl and falls head over heels) but the rivalry between ML and his sister is just starting to heat up, so I anticipate a good plot development in the upcoming episodes. The first nine episodes were really great, and I expect the remaining episodes to be just as good. I will be tuned in for each one! Keep up the good work!!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"King the land is literally affective and such a fun show like you'd never get bored.  The actors were amazing, their chemistry was on point and the second lead couple got a little screen timing together but still loved them.  This drama has the same plot as Business proposal and what's wrong with Secretary kim thats true but you'll never get the feeling that you've already watched such drama and it's boring n all.  King the land is complete fun and the way Gu Won and Sarang love each other that'll melt your heart and also would make you feel single nvm.  This drama is getting hate for no reason."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"This drama enlightened my darkest days.  I've been so down a few weeks ago, but I accidentally saw this drama from the newest released of Netflix.  I love how the characters did their roles. I like how sweet yet entertaining they are.  I highly recommend this drama for those who wants to see how funny, romantic and entertaining scenes they have here.  Every moments of the episodes here is ridiculously funny. I'm actually not a fan of Lee Joon-Ho and Lim Yoon-A but, they nailed this drama.  I've been talking this drama to my friends and family. My mom is watching it now as well. She saw how I laugh while watching it, she was so curious and I recommend it to her.  Anyways, enjoy watching this drama.  PS. This is my first time to give a review."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,1,,Waste of time a basic boring show Nothing is funny and nothing is interesting... I wasted 2 hours on this show Couldn't even find anything funny as the actors try to make fun but it just keeps on gutting more cringe and boring by the time.  I don't recommend you guys so don't waste your precious time on a show like this because trust me you will regret wasting it.  The actors don't seem to even act serious ...what a shame because I was expecting something good but here I am regretting wasting my time over this simple and uninteresting story Save your time everyone and find a better show I AM DISAPPOINTED.
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"I never write reviews but I absolutely LOVED this! I've watched a couple of South Korean television series now, but by far this has to be my favourite. Lee Jun-ho and Im Yoon-ah were absolutely wonderful as the lead characters. I was rooting for them from the start. It was such a lovely story and I totally fell in love with all the characters. It was actually also really good that Netflix released the episodes each week and I'd find myself counting down the days to the next episode dropped. Some of the sub stories and characters were so good. It was also not too long - some of the other series I've watched are 50 plus episodes. I hope to see the lead actors in other things. The grandma played by Kim Young-Ok is wonderful and I'd also enjoyed watching in Young Lady and Gentleman. I highly recommend this series."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,1,,I forced myself to watch this but it's not really my type. It was corny and the comedy is so forced. The beginning episodes were kind of interesting but the later episodes are just solely focus on the ML and FL love story and how did they fall in love with each other that fast?!  They tried so hard to give a dejavu of Red Sleeve and Squid Game which is so unnecessary.  I love romantic comedies but this was cringe. Not even worth watching.  The ML and FL's visuals are saving this drama and that theyre idols with huge fan base. Plot wise it's below mid.  DON'T WATCH IT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO WASTE YOUR TIME.
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"The low rating is just absurd. The series is lovely, great acting, beautiful scenery, feel good and uplifting story, elements of comedy, wonderful characters, it's a tale of love and friendship. I just couldn't stop watching it and I think I will rewatch it straight away because I just cannot say goodbye to this story yet. There are dozens of American rom com productions that are plain horrible and the rating is way higher so no idea what happened here. Just see it and you won't regret the time spent, I think I got hooked on Korean romance and I am already looking trying to find another title."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,1,,"The acting and story are pure rubbish, awkward and predictable, and there is nothing that could make anyone want to watch it except for the characters' faces and clothes. I've got a romcom but they still have to put effort into making it. The only thing that makes this drama popular is that the main cast and actress are Korean idols and their fans will watch anything they do even if it's really bad. And I think they'll get all the awards at the end of the year because no one cares about acting anymore, all eyes are now focused on how popular the drama is despite the awful things they've done.."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,1,,"How can they call it a romcom when it's not funny? Romcom is supposed to be fun, but this show is just plain boring. I couldn't get past episode 1. Nothing special, the storyline itself is outdated and the plot is dull. Male lead and female lead do not have great chemistry. The drama received lots of support and love from their fans because both are kpop idols. Due the drama is overhyped, i went to check out the drama. Unfortunately, it turns out to be a huge disappointment. It looks just like a cheap copy of ""Business Proposal"", except ""Business Proposal"" was a huge success. The male lead is the worst ceo ever existed."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"King of the Land"" is a heartwarming K-drama that wraps you in a cozy blanket of comfort and cuteness. Its endearing storyline and relatable characters create an immersive experience that left me chuckling like never before. The male lead's character is a shining example of all things charming and endearing, making it impossible not to root for him. The drama's ability to evoke genuine laughter after a prolonged absence is a testament to its delightful writing and exceptional performances. For anyone seeking a feel-good escape with a dash of romance and a lot of laughter, ""King of the Land"" is an absolute green flag."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,9,,One of the best I have ever seen. For real why is it getting soooo much hate? Also It's really popular so i was shocked when i saw the low ratings . I was looking for something like this after business proposal and I finally found something . Totally recommended. If I could rated with 100/10 I would  Plot :8/10 It's the chliche Plot Acting: 10/10 Speechless Chemistry: 10/10 They are perfect for each other . Their chemistry it's just off charts.  Suspense: 10/10 I really wanted to see what was going to happen next and I was never disappointed  To sum up it's a great underrated series and it definitely doesn't deserve all the hate. MUST WATCH.
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Wow this was a great K-Drama. I really loved this series. I practically smiled through every episode. I think I fell in love too. It was really hard waiting for the next episodes to be released. I already said I am going to watch it again. While waiting on each episode I had a chance to watch The red sleeve. That was excellent as well. I know I fell for the lead actor, LeeJonHo, I hope that is right. He is very handsome and debonair in this role. He also has the prettiest lips I have ever seen on a man. Really, that is what I kept saying through the entire series. I just wanted to just gently kiss him. That kinda freaked me out because I can not ever remember wanting to do that at all. Not even to my ""boyfriend "".😁 I gave this a 2 thumbs up and I would have given it 4 if possible. I am here in the US reading every word of the subtitles. Keep it coming I can't wait for the next great story to be told."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"I love it so much. Straight to the point and all. For the very last part where her husband was changing suits, I would have loved to see her standing up to clap but being pregnant though and expecting, then, they would kiss and all that. Who really doesn't want a fairy tale. So fun, lovely, exciting and just name it.  Love the way they hit the nail on the head too. No hard feeling, no beating around the Bush, no suspense, no awkward moments. Everything was just all all worthwhile. Then, hos step sister could have just hugged the step mom out too. This review doesn't contain spoilers for me, if you think it does, please, forgive and parson my ill manners. Thank you. Do enjoy viewing."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"The series is very beautiful, and I hope that you will download the episodes faster. I cannot wait. It is a beautiful series, and the actors are very beautiful. I hope that you do not pay attention to the negative words. Can you change the show date? I can't wait I really really love this drama I'm going crazy I can't wait I really love this drama I really really love this drama And I love the actor Junho and Yoona, they fit together very, very well and are cute with each other, and this makes me miss them and miss the drama very much. I really thank the director and the actors for their hard work."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"If you are tired of traumatic k-dramas, King The Land is the perfect choice for you. It's entertaining, lovely, and visually attractive. Cinematography is top notch, main leads Junho and Yoona are extremely good looking and their chemistry is not joke.  Although the first episode is a little slow and there are some awkward scenes (I'm talking about the caught in bathroom scene), it gets better and better.  The male protagonist Gu Won is totally a green flag. He treats Sarang gently and even ask for permission before kissing her for the first time. The female protagonist Cheon Sarang is a smart, bright and funny hotelier.  The relationship between Gu Won and his secretary is quite hilarious. In short, you should definitely watch King The Land."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"I'm in love with this drama. I love romantic stories, without unnecessary angst and lots of sweet scenes. I like drama, don't get me wrong, but I hate when it's placed wrongly, like I saw in some last korean dramas. So, lots of people are criticizing how cliché it is, but, in my humble opinion, if you're looking for great acting, cute scenes and an uncomplicated romance, this is it for you. I searched a lot for one of this kind and it made me feel refreshed to finally find it. Cliché stories are good, if well made, so please believe me when I say this one is certainly a great one. I hope you like as much as I did! 💜"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"AAAAAAAK I LIKE THIS DRAMA SO MUCH! I like the straightforward characters of Guwon and Sarang. Even though people say the storyline is corny, it doesn't matter to me. The story is very fresh and can relieve fatigue! Even though this drama is facing controversy, I still support and wish the best. I don't know, but I'm so addicted to watching this drama. Guwon and Sarang always make me smile and be whimsical. I hope that whatever problems this drama is facing, it can be solved properly and wisely.  Fighting!  Even though this drama is facing controversy, I still support and wish the best. I don't know, but I'm so addicted to watching this drama. Guwon and Sarang always make me smile and be whimsical. I hope that whatever problems this drama is facing, it can be solved properly and wisely."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"If you read the low rating comments, they all come from a certain group of individuals that were upset by the portrayal of a certain fictional character in 2 of the episodes.  The drama is actually great, from the acting to the cinematography, scenery and recreation of yes, cliches from past rom-coms but with a twist. This is intentional, it wants to go back to original rom-com ways. The chemistry between the leads is wonderful, both of them are very involved in their roles and are delivering more than the script they were given.  So give it a shot and ignore the haters, you will like it, I guarantee."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"To keep it short, it's an amazing series for me, it's probably my favorit series in the last few years! It's a great and lovely romance with lots of comic moments! The acting is very good (worth very few and rare occasions).  I just can't wait for the next episodes to be released (Netflix is stuck at ep. 12 right now)... It's really entertaining for me and they are boosting a lot of different emotions from scene to scene and I love the fact it's built on ""old style"" concepts (like please, thank you, may I, I'm here for you, etc... respect, care, love, friendship, understanding, forgiveness, empathy just to name a few).  It's a 9.60/10 for me, I can't wait to see and re-watch how everything develops further!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"It's just PERFECT, i LOVE everything about this show, just perfect. The characters, their love, they are literally the perfect couple, THE couple.  They love each other, complement each other, there's a lot of love, understanding and respect. There are funny moments, there are a lot of emotions.  Not gonna lie, the first 5 minutes of the pilot i was so bored (like duh, of course because literally nothing happened yet) so i left it there, but then i watched it again and finish the whole 16 episodes in 3 days, THREE days and that was because i was busy, i would've watched this in one day. Watch it."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"I have never posted a review before... and I do not speak any Korean. So imagine my surprise in falling in love with this wonderfully crafted series! The characters are beautifully developed especially Won, Sa-ranh, the evil sister, the besties, grandma, and the loving but down to business father. I enjoyed the development of a love story. A story about friendship, taking chances, and being yourself. It is so rare and refreshing to have entertaining plots that do not have violence, gratuitous sex, a ton of cursing, etc. Instead you have humor, imagination, and fun. I watched the show 2xs in a row and shared with friends! I actually googled cow's head soup recipes and looked on yelp where to find some near me! If you did not enjoy watching King of Land, you need a heart transplant A. S. A. P."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"A must watch Kdramas especially for RomCom fans. This drama got me kicking my feet and feeling giddy inside. The plot is so cute and don't get me started on the chemistry of the main leads. Their chemistry is so good, you will feel like they are dating in real life! It's also refreshing to see a kdrama where the denial phase is skipped and both of the mains leads are confident in each other to avoid misunderstandings. It might seem a bit cliche but trust me, there are parts where you will be surprised. Also, the kissing scenes?! Acting from the cast and featured OSTs were all amazing. Definitely in my top dramas of all time."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Clichés are what dress up rom-coms and King the Land made use of them well.  What make this standout from the rest is the process of the main characters (Sarang and Gu Won) overcoming this predictable story plot isn't cliché. The story is rather developed, specially the great character development of the Gu Won and her sister.  King The Land stayed true to its genre no frustrating moments due to misunderstanding, no unnecessary love triangles, breakups, no annoying second leads and just healthy relationships including friendship, comedy with great punch lines, perfect closure and pure good vibes. Definitely my healing drama.  Plus the most beautiful couple among the rom-com series that I've watched.  Thank you so much Yoona and Junho and all the other casts and the team behind."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"The story is giving a cheesy romance-comedy that resembles a hallmark movie. It's definitely my type of show, especially if you are not looking for a heavy storyline that wrecks your brain. I enjoy the show simply because of the chemistry between the main characters. It's no joke that they may have been the plot all along. Their interaction is natural and in some scenes you may be up wondering if it is acting because of how the improvisation.  For those who dislike this, are probably looking for something new which is quite missing in this show. The set of rich male and not so-rich female are often overplayed in KDramas. It is not a new concept that has been used since the early kDramas.  However, the classic rich male protagonist has never failed seeing how it is still popularized. And if there is one thing that this show did well is probably casting the actor and actress! Personally, this show has been joyful. I would recommend watching this show to get your level of dopamine higher. If you are busy working or dealing with depressing things in real life, watch this with a light-hearted mind!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,1,,"Waste of time , I watch too many k drama but this is not worth to watch at all many better drama are available.  The story is not entertaining, and the series is an addition to the time. The staff is inconsistent, and the quality of the work gives you the feeling that you are watching a series from the 2000s. I never enjoyed it.  I do not recommend watching it at all. I did not expect to see a bad job to this cheek, especially since the quality of Korean series has become good in this era. This is very unfortunate and disappointing.  The filming must be reviewed before broadcasting, regardless of the dialogues being unbalanced and lacking in a sense of humor. The problem is that the episode is estimated at a full hour. It will waste your precious time. Never, never, ever. I do not recommend watching it. If there is a rating of less than one star, I will put it."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Thank you for creating such a beautiful rom-com drama with a good actors, stories, cinematography and beautiful ending. Big thanks to jtbc and director Lim for bringing yoona and junho together, other actors and all the staff king the land. You've all really worked hard. Actor lee junho and actress lim yoona thank you for choosing a good piece of king the land. I will never forget this masterpiece rom-com drama. Unforgettable. You all have to watch this very good drama. If you watch this drama, you'll feel how real love is. So many languages love in them. Your hearts will be very flowering full of love."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"I absolutely loved this show. It was very cute and had me laughing out loud numerous times each episode. I noticed many of the bad reviews hadn't even given the show a fair chance as many were written a month ago before all of the episodes had even aired. I just finished the show this week and have to say it is one of my favorite kdramas. The main characters had great chemistry and were enjoyable to watch. The three leading women had an inspiring tight nit friendship, with each contributing a unique storyline to the plot. The first kiss was ONE OF THE BEST Kdrama kisses I have seen! I would highly recommend giving this show a watch!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Give yourself a break and give this show a chance. This is something that will make you smile on hard days. If you're looking for complicated and mind-blowing plot- this is not it! The plot is somewhat predictable, good ole cliches that we all love. The story just makes you smile and takes your mind off the heaviness of adult life. The lead characters' chemistry is top notch. Even the behind the scenes make you swoon! The supporting characters are also very fit for their roles. I heard the filming took almost a year, and you can see the camaraderie of everyone on set. Over all, a must watch! :)"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,1,,"This drama is very cringe, I feel that this drama is only aimed at young children who can't think fully yet, the storyline is too pushy until I have to force myself to watch every scene cut in this drama this is the worst drama i have ever watched.  To be honest, the image quality in this video is very good, starting from the color contrast and image sharpness, I like it but the writing of the story, the characters and the background of the story are very cringe it all feels very forced relatability everyone knows that drama must not be real but this drama is too imposing a drama whose story is impossible, meaning that there are many stories with a romantic comedy background but they write well but this drama is very, very far-fetched."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"You can tell how hard the director, writers, staff, and actors worked to make the show thoroughly enjoyable. Even moments and storylines seen in previous dramas seem new with how they were approached. Junho and Yoona are such great actors that each scene and moment brings happiness. The most I've ever enjoyed a drama!  As the show progresses if gets better and better. I can't wait to see how the second half of the season turns out. I have complete faith that it'll be great based on the episodes so far.  Junho and Yoona's chemistry really adds to the drama too. They're such close friends and you can feel that in each scene! Great, great drama!!!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Don't be fooled by the bad reviews. The Arabs (due to a scene that has been deleted) and a certain fan group have bombed this drama with hate. This was No1 in the world on Netflix, and the 8th most watched Netflix show for 2023 for a reason. Persevere past the first 2 or 3 episodes. It gets better and better as it goes along. The second half of the series is the best. The cast will make you fall in love. Lee Junho in particular is to die for with his subtle acting that uses his whole body, voice and eyes. He is a Baeksang Best Actor for a reason. Don't expect too much from the storyline. It is light and fluffy and thoroughly enjoyable. Don't analyse it in any detail. Just grab a wine and enjoy. This drama will make you happy."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"This tv series is great if you are feeling low and love romance. The characters and the story are very funny and the story is so addictive. Honestly i will rewatch it.  The main male actor is really hot and good looking, so I recommend to watch it also for this reason.  The environment that is created by the cast also fills your hart with joy and feels like family.  The way he fights and tries to make her fall in love makes your hart worm and make you wish to have this love story.  The hotel setting is also great and pleasing. It is very luxurious and honestly i've never seen a tv romance in a hotel, so i think it was innovative.  I really recommend it."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"My wife and I watched this show and loved it. We'd have given an even higher rating if we could.  It was so refreshing to watch a show that did not involve filthy language, smut and innuendo but had real humor, intrigue and true romance. An almost childlike and innocent love story that left us totally captivated.  I'll admit that some of the scenes seemed a bit overdone at first but that became,for us, part of the charm of this series. We particularly roared with laughter when the eye movements were accompanied by the ""beep"" sound effects.  What's wrong with watching good old fashioned entertainment these days?  We didn't find anything to bad mouth about. The characters all played their parts convincingly and we very quickly developed a ""love and hate"" relationship with the different characters.  A really good series. Thank you Netflix.10/10."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,My wife and I started to see it and we could not stop. It was fun and particular in its own way. Different!  It was my first Korean series and I was so pleased I looked for other and have not found yet one that is similar.  I was surprised by the rate given. Does not deserve that low rating. Makes me think if I have to then look for the low railing ones to find my match.  I recommend this very much ... also liked a lot the culture and the respect the young Korean give to elder people. But in a business world with lots of social pressure and classes.  Hope this review help someone give it a chance and enjoy it like we did.
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"I saw the series and loved it. One of the best Korean series. I loved the story, and especially the love story between them. As I watched the episodes, I laughed, I cried, I was sad and happy. A beautiful story for those who like ""to live in a pink world"". I'm really sorry it ended like this... it was an ending that, for those who watched it, made me wish there was a sequel. I think the producers should think about a sequel.  AMOR 5 S(miles)  King the Land part 2 please.  They know each other in the real life for 15 years, maybe they was a couple in the past... they are perfect to each other in real life also like in the show."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"I really like it! Yes, it's not the most sophisticated show out there, but I really liked it does not try to be one. Just light, fun, corny rom-com. When starting to watch it, that is what you should expect (I think the trailer gives a correct feeling). The lead actor is great, persuasive and I think he delivered deep emotions and the growing love story really good(!). In general, the actors were good and I believed and was touched from their emotions. I thought it is a candid show. The girls friendship was candid and their interactions made me laugh. The videography was well done and with beautiful locations and details. I would completely recommend for those who enjoy this genre!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Had so much fun watching this. Some may say its pretty typical. But this had given me laugh, tears and fulfillment watching the whole series. A MUST-WATCH! All characters are great! <3.  I just had the most delightful time watching this romantic movie! The chemistry between the leads was undeniable, and their love story was so sweet and endearing.  I loved how the movie balanced humor and heart, making it a joy to watch from start to finish. The supporting cast was also fantastic, adding depth and warmth to the story.  Glad I was able to get a hold of this series. Surely added to my list!....."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Exactly the fluffy and cute rom com I was looking for! The plot is excellent and the speed of the whole thing is great. The kind of mixed up we didn't expect. The Red Sleeve ft. Squid Game ft. King The Land. <3  Love episode 7&8! I was laughing the whole time. The 2 leads have an awesome chemistry.  I'm in love this drama and I'm waiting for every episode! It's the best romcom of 2023... I truly recommend it  I'm arabic/Muslim and fully support this drama. For the people who are rating this drama with 1 with fake accounts this reality and nothing new, :)  Cant wait for the other episode !!! <3."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Reminds me of the good, old, classic romcom. It's refreshing and new! The plots are funny, cheesy and predictable yet it still makes you want more, wait for it and give you goosebumps. The chemistry between the MC is just *chef kiss*. The supporting actors are all great and wonderful too! Very talented and believable acting! Every episodes keep me cheesing and wanting for more!  The only reason some might not like the drama is if you're an extreme anti-fan of the actors. Because, if you like all the other dramas that are mentioned alot, there's no reason, this one shouldn't be love.  They're all different and good in their own ways!  I can't wait till the climax and what the future episodes holds!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,I have seen many romcoms but this one is so far one of the best! The chemistry between the leads is insane. They are both great actors and are perfect fits for these roles. The secondary character's also are doing a fantastic job. A beautiful touching and funny kdrama I will never forget. I am actually quite sad that it is coming to an end but I will continue to support and love this show to the end. I am excited to see how the story unfolds in the upcoming last 4 episodes. People are criticizing it for no reason. It definitely deserves better! KING THE LAND FIGHTING!!! LEE JUNHO IM YOONA FIGHTING!! <3.
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Everyone know that Starting episodes are storyline build up time so you might feel down but believe me this was my 2nd Korean Drama and I loved the way how the story events are going on, every episodes are well directed, all characters are interestingly build up and the cute romantic scene will never let you down. Actor and actress have a beautiful chemistry on their face...i love the granny and actor episodes its so cute and nostalgic.  Do rich successful man actually fall in love with poor woman? Don't question your mind and Hop On, sit tight and watch it believe me it is worth watching....."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"This is a very good, must-watch romantic comedy Kdrama! I believe that chemistry is the key to a good romcom and Lee Junho and Im Yoona's natural chemistry is vital to its success. The romantic spark between them, as well as their respective characters (Goo Won and Cheon Sarang) is authentic and presented in a way that the audience unquestioningly buys into the love story hook, line, and sinker. The comedy is equally important to the success of this drama and the supporting characters are all well-written and superbly portrayed. King the Land is certainly a joy to watch and I will definitely be rewatching this again and again!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,Just love this drama the main leads chemistry and acting is awesome. The storyline about this drama is good too. This drama should be love I have loving it form the beginning of the episode. If u Haven't watch it yet you should be watching it.  This K-drama offers a plenty of funny and romantic moments that are sure to bring a smile to your face.  While i look the review of this drama and I see many people doesn't love this maybe there should be various reasons. But it not worth hating. I think people just review it to just make it's rating low. I see in every treading K-drama or C-drama that going on or that have been completed now days people are rating it low. At last I want to say this drama is Worth loving then hating.
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Funny and enjoyable.  The romance between the main characther is great and the chemistry in the show is also very good. A show where you don't have to think much, but it's a nice romantic comedy with a touch of cuteness, just exactly what I needed at the time. Great watch after a stressful day."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Excellent production values. Charming and entertaining. Classic and touching rom com. Leading man very easy on the eyes. Solid script and wonderful casting. Im on Ep. 13 and find myself hoping for a Season Two.  South Korea makes great TV and movies. Right up there with Britain and the US.  Korean acting academies are turning out highly skilled artists. Same can be said for their other staff and crew.  It's a delightful updated Cinderella story. Guaranteed to warm your heart.  Ignore the low scoring trolls. Probly work for a rival production company.  The only thing I really dont get is the title in English. It literally makes no sense. Even if you convert the word ""king"" From a noun to a forced verb... still makes no sense."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,8,,"King the Land whisks you away to the opulent world of luxury hotels, where a quirky chaebol heiress (Yoona) and a dedicated hotelier (Lee Junho) find themselves entangled in a delightful whirlwind.

킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,8,,"It may not be the most original romance story but it really surprised me to see this show getting such a lot of 1 star ratings.  A pretty girl and a handsome boy, nice and cozy romance, a whole lot of smiles and kisses and cuddles, some minor conflicts and a feel good vibe all around. The lead couple's chemistry cannot be denied and the friend group is fun to watch.  And, I found it funny most of the time.  I really did not get why people hated it so much, it is, afterall, a romantic comedy to relax ad watch in good nature.  Anyway, I may be partial to Jun-ho afterall, so maybe that is why I gave it a higher rating than most. Still, it does not deserve a rating below 6.5."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"King the Land is one of the best romance series I have seen. The comedy in this Kdrama is hilarious, and the amount of awkward situations they are in contribute to plenty of giggles and smiles. Whilst there isn't too much drama in King the Land, it is a wonderful safe watch for those who need happy storylines. The predictable romance patterns replicates a sense of comfort to me, and I'm sure millions of other people will love this too. King the Land is perfect to watch on a cold winter evening, to warm any soul. The chemistry between Lee Jun-ho, and Lim Yoon-a is simply electric. Longing stares, and charismatic conversations are just a few scenes of magnificent acting that they portray. This beautiful love story is definitely worth watching for those who love love, and want to be wrapped up in a big, warm, and soft Kdrama Blanket."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"I was shocked when I saw the low rating on this amazing romance story .  What a refreshing change to see 2 main leads portray a true love story without all the drama.  I'ts quite tiring to watch love stories where the female main lead is immature and childish and the male lead teiws to show masculinity , quite a few dramas over exaggerate a love scene only for us to be left with a rubbish kiss. There was no long drawn out scenes before their kisses and they didn't hold back either..  Exactly what a healthy relationship should look like. 2 people in love who respect and support one another with out any child like tantrums.  I only wish there was a second series."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Honestly this is the best Kdrama of 2023 that I have watched. I've enjoyed every scene, moment and second of each episode. This drama is excellent.  Yoona is somebody I've adored since I was a young teenager. And her beauty never fails to impress me. Jun Ho's character and aura just adds onto my love for this drama. Never have I left a review on a Kdrama. But as much as I've watched so many other Kdrama's that I have loved every moment of. This drama made me feel different in a good way.  The chemistry is good. Every episode gives me good comfort and entertainment and never failed to make me laugh."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Really good kdrama for romance lovers.  The main characters had incredible chemistry, and I really enjoyed how they portrayed healthy and mature communication. They supported and loved each other, and that allowed each one of them to succeed in what they wanted.  I enjoyed the overall message of union and supporting one another. It was present both on the professional and personal lives of the characters. I'm glad that the friendship among Sa-rang, Pyung-hwa, and Da-eul didn't have any childish and unnecessary dramas, unlike in most tv shows portraying feminine friendships.  It was really good seeing beloved actors like Kim Youn-ok (from as the grandma, and Anupam Tripathi (from Squid Game) as prince Samir."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"This is the best romantic drama I've seen. I don't know what these guys are doing rating it 3/10stars but I give it a perfect 10. If I am teaching my son how to treat a woman this will be my guide & if it's my daughter, I'll show her to be positive amidst negative people and make sure to be yourself true to any guy as they respects you as Yoona portrayed in this K-drama series. This is the benchmark of how to start, keep and enjoy a relationship. Junho respect this beautiful woman who isn't well off but that didn't matter. The romance was also blissful, the series had a lot of fun & I hope they will end up in a real life relationship. Kudos to the King 👑👏"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"This type of rom-com is what I dreams of for so long. It gives me a lot of happiness and brought me away from stressful life. I love King The Land.  It may be too light for some viewers that looking for heavy plots and more plots. But for me, King The Land lighten up my days and give me some sweet love fantasy that was long lost in real life. You hardly can find true love in this world. Even though I still believe in love. Understanding and communication are so important to a relationship. King The Land was taught well to some relationship between the two. I will never forget the love of Gu Won and Sarang who always thought and taking of each other feelings."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Excellent romantic comedy. Super surprised for the young talents there. Gu won character is well prepared. Without too much words we understand feelings and emotions. Secretary No is loyal and sweety. Mrs Gu totally credible. Not only for young people. We have enjoyed all generations together. 2nd part? Values, integrity and hope is there Respect for the elders but a new step for next generations in Korean drama. In addition not too much chapters. W6 is enough and probably people is waiting for the 2nd part to know what the future brings for the characters ( parents again together...?). Highly recommend for a sweet moment and laughter."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,1,,"Korean romcom are known for cliche and slapstick but this crosses every limit. The so called comedy scenes are so pathetically orchestrated, with the bg music from 90s or 2000s. Someone said great chemistry. Not at all. Both actor in their own zone, no connection. Chemistry is not only having a long kiss scene. As if it doesnt matter whoever can be put in others place. It seems like Director hasn't bothered to take second shot of a scene goes wrong. I have never seen a more caricatured male lead character in my life. And Yoona is not an Actor material, she has proved this again. The drama is cringe max. I have dropped."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"King the Land is an entertaining, enchanting romantic fairy tale with superb cinematography, luxurious actors - a high-end production of a lighthearted, healing drama filmed in several countries - perfect to enjoy this summer.  Ahead of the drama airing, Kakaopage also produced a delightful webtoon of the same name featuring ML and FL as children.  Korean top acting award Baeksang Best Actor Winner for his complex role in ""The Red Sleeve, Lee Junho, is an outstanding actor with heavenly charisma and princely visuals. Female lead idol actress YoonA is a perfect, beautiful, sassy foil for the broody, standoffish character Gu Won who has had little love shown to him ever since he was a child. Supporting actors do their work egregiously. Gu Won's friend and secretary, Noh Sang-Sik (Ahn Se Ha) gives zest and humor to the whole proceedings. Looking forward to the unfolding of this delightful dramedy and the love story between the two stars who seem to clash at every turn, producing hilarious results. Highly recommended!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,1,,"The show lacks literally everything. They try to make it funny but no one laughs, Its beyond cringe. Its a total waste of time watching this. I mean to tell you the truth i started it after looking at the reviews i wanted to see what was soo about the show and oh well i saw , This show is totally boring. Whats worse is the commedy, absolutely cringe. The first episode was eh kinda meh but i mean works what else could you expect but the second episode was nothing like the cover for the drama i mean its cringe because the actors expressoins and actions dont really go hand in hand which makes this really awkward to wartch. Most of all the show lacks expressions . In a nutshell they try to fake literally everything which makes the show totally miserable.  Totally not recommended.  NOT WORTH THE WATCH."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"It's a light hearted drama filled with joy and fun. It's been a long time since we had a fun rom com, and this definitely brings me joy on the weekends. I love how Yoona and Junho portrayed their character perfectly and their chemistry is awesome! Story wise, not the best but definitely very fun to watch! It brings me so much joy these few weeks.  It actually pulled me out of the kdrama slump. I love their characters, the cast (especially Sarang's friend). I also see a the story going in a fun way, I chuckled a few times watching how Sarang and Gu Won interacted with each other. Their chemistry are seriously awesome."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,9,,"A very fluffy, cliche romantic comedy.  Does not pretend to be anything but a light, easy watch that lightly incorporates some ongoing social issues workers can still face in the service industry .  Very beautifully filmed with some lovely cinematic shots. The actors have great chemistry with each other, be it the 2 leads or the side characters and how their stories intertwine.  Not always as politically correct in some instances as some would wish, but doesn't take itself too seriously (so the viewer shouldn't either).  At the end of the day it just makes me cringe, smile and feel good (as was intended)."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,9,,"The main story of this romantic comedy drama is pretty light and uncomplicated. It's easy to watch without having to think much about the story.  From romantic pov, there are many romantic and cute scenes and lines from the characters which might make people couldn't help to dream of getting same kind of romantic life. There are visually beautiful scenes which we can see from the good visual of the male and female lead taken with a nice cinematography.  From comedy pov, there are many funny scenes with small details and adlibs added by the actors. The reactions from the actors in the funny scenes were added with sound effects, makes it even more funny to watch.  There are some scenes and lines which could be changed by production team to make this drama more comfortable to watch. Some might think this drama is boring and showing something similar to other dramas with same genre, but I personally think this drama shows its own vibe. Even dramas have same genre, acting from the different actors will make the scenes colorful in their own way."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"This is a classic funny romcom drama and keeps me watching it. I feel so lonely while watching it... I love that they're both flirty in a realistic way and not awkard with each other. The main lead, Guwon is a green flag, He cares about her so much but he's also respectful with it. I'm curious about his childhood trauma too.  Also actors in romcom kdramas usually don't act realisticly and their expressions are too exaggerated for me but in King The Land; Junho, who played Guwon, his face expressions are so natural that sometimes i feel like he doesn't acting.  I normally don't like this type of dramas but this is really good."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"This show has been called a ""silly little romcom"" by the creators themselves because that's what it's all about. King The Land promised to be a fun light-hearted drama full of clichés and all the tried and tested romcom tropes. It's only halfway through but that's exactly what it delivers. This is a drama that's not meant to be analyzed in-depth so if that's your cup of tea then you may not be able to like this.  This drama also has great characterizations of the leads. Male lead is not your typical chaebol character, i mean he is like them but he is more. He may seem aloof and typically arrogant but he is actually respectful and listens well. The female lead is bubbly, charming, beautiful and amazingly skillful and intelligent. Their banters are so fun to watch and their sexual tension is growing exponentially as they discover more about each other. The supporting casts are also good and provides amazing side stories.  The OSTs are just *chef's kiss*, i have no words to explain how good they are. They provide a perfect backdrop to every momentous scene. The pacing is actually quite fast and is not unnecessarily draggy.  Overall, if you're looking for a relaxed, fun and non-stressful drama, then this is highly recommended for you."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"I have to say this, but I don't get it why they received hate FOR THE BEST AND MOST LOGICAL DRAMA! I've watched other dramas, and yes the first few episodes didn't capture much of their story. But believe me it gets better as it progresses ... plus the casting is perfect!  The chemistry of the main lead as well as the second leads is upto mark! Just a happy and jolly series.  Some series have disheartening themes so I was looking for a drama which didn't have anything sad in it and I stumbled across King the Land and believe me it was a good decision. I'm on episode 11 and it has all along been an amusing roller coaster of positive vibes. If you are looking for a drama that gives only freshness then this is a go for you. I hope they get more appreciation for their work!  Much love!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,One of my favorite KDRAMA so far..I love the chemistry of the characters..Very Comedic and Romantic..Especially with the two..GUWON and SARANG..I love their vibes so so much..SARANG is very very pretty and Guwon is handsome. Their match for it's other..The Comedy scene they had..I love it's so so so much..even the romantic scene..It makes my heart fluttering..Even the other cast are very very good to their respective roles. I love this KDRAMA so so much..10000/100..Very Highly Recommended .. Especially when you watch with your family...Theirs no boring scene. Overall. WOW. BEST DRAMA FOR ME....
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"10/10 for the whole team! Loving every scene of this kdrama and looking forward to its episodes until the end (Hoping for season 2?). This really making me soooo happy (hermesss). It's so lightweight, a perfect go to kdrama for destressing and relaxing. I really looove the casts especially our Junho oppa (best actor) and Yoona unnie, they are perfect match to begin with, and all supporting cast who contributed a huge part in making King the Land.  Our King the Land team did really a great great job. Thank you for making King the Land nation really really happy. You've worked really hard. Fighting."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Chemistry between the Male Lead and the Female Lead is fantastic. Once you start watching this drama, I bet you will never want wait for next week for new episodes. It's that addictive. Both the leads acts so natural and fit into their roles perfectly. Other actor's acting is also good especially Yoona's friends.  No wonder Jun Ho and Yoona are a gorgeous couple and they compliment each other really well. Junho's visuals are out of the world. He is so Handsome and Yoona looks so cute and pretty.  Manifesting that this couple should get married soon. There is some intense chemistry between them. I'll be very happy if they consider to get married to each other."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"This is a lighthearted, romantic comedy that shows the different struggles the 2 main leads go through in life, coming from very different backgrounds. Their proximity within the King Hotel sets them on a course to encounter each other in situations that are humorous, frustrating and endearing. Experiencing the growth of both characters as they get to know one another is delightful.  Both the ML and FL are doing a wonderful job conveying their new emotions towards each other. It's a charming drama that reminds you of the first flutters you experience falling in love.  I eagerly wait to see the next episode."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Never mind the boycott from the Arab world. This is a really good romantic comedy. It is complete, balanced and entertaining from the first to the last episode. The story isn't new, but that doesn't matter because the actors lift and stick to their roles. The filming is beautiful and I especially enjoyed seeing Thailand again.  If you want good entertainment, a few laughs and a few tears, then this is the series for you.  FL and ML have an incredibly good chemistry that carries through all episodes. They appear so natural and unless they know each other from before, this is really good acting.  Thank you South Korea for all the joy you share. Thanks to skilled producers and story writers. Thanks to all the incredibly talented actors who convey all the human emotions and relationships. You are the best!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,1,,"Very boring show. I am really disappointed by the lead actors. To be honest they have no chemistry at all,at least I didn't find. People are overhyped for this show and makers took opportunity because of their dating rumors. I lost my precious hours for this nonsense show!!! It seems they are trying to make a romcom but reality it doesn't seem funny. Yoona doesn't have any facial expressions. If you don't want to waste your precious time just don't watch it and watch other shows. This show storyline is very predictable and cliche. I wish I could give them 0 star . I wish they would make new ,fresh and original content."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Best romcom ever. Very good storyline, superb acting (esp Junho) and great cinematography. It was well crafted that it feels like your watching a movie every episode. No boring episode and every scene matters. I am really excited to know about Guwon's mom. And I can the romantic scene in episode 8 is very well executed. It feels so real. In the many years I have watched k series, this is first one I really loved. So I was really surprised seeing those negative feedbacks. It is a purely an intentional demolition job. So sorry to tell you guys, you cannot put an brilliant work of art down. Congratulations to KTL family and to Junho and Yoona, hope you will be my next binjin...hahaha.. my junna."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Not very original but the main leads' chemistry and acting overshadowed the lack of originality for me. I liked Yoona even before but wasn't really into her acting but she proved me wrong with this one. She is definitely the embodiment of Cheon Sa Rang! As for Lee Junho, this guy REALLY can act, might have another acting award for this one. I also like the supporting cast, especially Cheon Sa Rang's friends! They make it appear like they have been friends for a long time and not just acting.  This drama brings back the romantic comedy vibe that have drawn me into Kdrama/Kpop way back in the 2010s. Editing and cinematography is also superb!  If you want a drama to cheer you up or just a feel good drama then would really recommend this one!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,2,,"I should have trusted the users' opinion for this one but I imagined being the leads two idols perhaps they were a lot of haters giving it a low rate. The truth is it's all just so cliche, but not in the good way., The script is so bad it didn't engage me at all, the dialogues were not funny. The comedy didn't feel natural, too forced and corny. The acting also disapointed me, the characters lack depth and it seems they were actor friends just hanging out for the pay check, I couldn't watch them pass episode 3, and that was too much for me. Totally not recommended. Just, don't waste your time."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"I love this show so much coz it has simple storyline and I can enjoy it without thinking much. I laughing, giggling, crying, screaming whenever i see Yoona and Junho on the screen. Their chemistry is top notch!! This is my healing drama. The other casts also doing great job and makes this drama even better. Even the script is a bit cheesy but it did not feel cringey because the casts doing great job with their lines. Their acting is so natural and great. I love all the casts in this drama. Every episodes is fun and I smile a lot watching this show. Hermess!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"I never thought that I will be watching a very light and comedic drama again for the 1000th time and enjoy it! I am really enjoying it.. and wait for it every Saturday and Sunday... as for Yuna I used to hate her acting, but I must say that I found her acting in this one much better than all her other dramas... of course she still need a lot of training to be an excellent actress, but I think she's on her way to be a very good one.. as for lee Jun ho I am so proud of him.. he is a very good actor and he was the main reason I watched the drama in the first place.. I wish this drama all the success."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,8,,"This show isn't for anyone and I can see why a lot of people dislike it. This show is so silly and unserious. It's so funny and I really love the chemistry between the two main leads. The fl isn't those aeygos or whatever you call them. She's bold and straightforward while the ml is silly and VERYY dramatic. It's like one of those typical rich guy falls in love with the poor girl troupe but it's soo good. The relationship buildup is good and the dynamics between the fl and her friends is so cute too ..!! The only negative thing about this show is it can give u a lot of second hand embarrassment. Other than that, I really really enjoy this show. It's like business proposal and what's wrong with secretary Kim but a bit better in my opinion. If y'all are into those cute cutesy romances, pls give this show a chance :) it will make u squee with excitement and makes u want for more eps..!!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,8,,"I really don't understand the harsh criticisms for this drama aside from the problematic(?) representation of middle eastern people. I am not Middle Eastern so I can't really say much on that but aside from that, I think this is a solid Kdrama. Yes it has cliche moments but i will always eat that up 😫😫  The rich boy- poor girl trope that other reviewers are saying is not really cliche in this? In my opinion, Yoona's character is paid pretty well and she adores her job. Junho's character doesn't really flaunt his wealth and he's just ignorant on some things but he is willing and open to learn what ""normal"" people do.  I also like how the show presents consent and pretty good communication as well? I also like how there's no love triangle. Some of the kissed scenes were a little awkward but i also just get shy watching pda that's more than like 10 seconds.  Overall, I think this is a cute light-hearted drama to watch as it makes me kick my feet and giggle like a little girl. I recommend this to anyone who like kdramas that are funny and romantic bc this one is soo unserious.  Side note: loveee the relationship gu won builds with yoona's grandma."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Even though it's ""an idea already used before"", it's still very enjoyable to watch, very cute and good for relaxing, with interesting characters, Sa-Rang is not annoying like protagonists in other dramas I've watched, on the contrary, she's hardworking and captivating, of course, she has her tantrums, but they're understandable, there's nothing bad to say about Gu-Won either, very mature and very charismatic, even if he is ""cold"", and they end up becoming a fantastic couple, with a lot of chemistry, and every time a new episode is released I find myself anxious to continue accompanying this lovely history.  Charming, it deserves all the fame it is getting, without a doubt, and I say that not being a fan of Korean series, I actually watch a few.  I highly recommend this drama."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Traditional ROMCOM type with amazing casts .  Especially Yoona and Junho is absolutely slay their characters . No serious plot but still relaxing and freshul . Very Much Funny, Beautiful Cinematography and stand out acting . Yoona as Cheon Sarang is so so beautiful . Her smile will make u feel stress out . Junho is also amazing actor . He's so handsome with suits . And many OST in here just beautiful . You may think King The Land is predictable and simple. You should know this drama is classic romantic comedy like Full House . No similar to these days ROMCOM drama. King The Land is absolutely worth to watch 10/10."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"It's my favourite series, along with The King: Eternal Monarch. For the fist time in K-drama, I saw a strong woman and man not giving up to pressure and holding together forever. Characters well builts, matures, mentally strongs and I specially liked a female character finally different from all I've seen: not shy, just embarrassed enough, a little prissy but not overly (I'd even say sickly, like all the other K-drama I've seen (20+)). Finally, a woman on a par with a man. They think in unison, act in agreement and trust each other completely. Also, the BEST FIRST KISS ever in any K-drama. Lee Jun-ho & Lim Yoon-a are really amazing. Their self-confidence is extraordinary. Great job from the Director, Im Hyun-Wook. Also congratulations to the creator and to the writer. Amazing story. The music is really fantastic. Thank you to all that gave, time and dedication, so King the Land could be so amazing."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"A perfect blend of drama, romance and comedy. Leaves you with the feed good emotion which is the hallmark of Korean series. A unique script which revolves around the lead actors with the usual rich poor divide but articulated in a very meaningful way to keep the audience hooked.  Set up in a grand hotel the drama has many twist and turns, the lead actress is too cute and brings a smile on your face with her innocent act.  The lead actors looks dashing, his dressing sense makes you fall in love with him wanting to copy his unique dressing style  Low IMDb for this beautiful piece of work is a big surprise.  Go for it without thinking twice!!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Admittedly, it starts off on a cheesy comedic tone but when it settles in, it's a wonderful story that isn't just the romance but about that, the working class and the power dynamic of bosses and companies with their employees, friendships, healing and growth. The relationship between Won and Sa-rang is 100% believable and we see how Won becomes smitten with one of best people on the planet. There are also compelling and interesting stories involving the leads' friends that could have had their own show, they are that solid. I have watched a lot of Korean entertainment lately and this is one of the best. Lee Jun-ho is a phenomenal leading man, walking that walk of a confident man. I dare say, he might be a better leading man than fellow 2pm member Taecyeon. Sorry, Taec."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"I am absolutely loving this drama! It has captured my heart and kept me hooked from start to finish. The storytelling is captivating, and I find myself eagerly anticipating each new episode. The performances are top-notch, with the actors bringing their characters to life with depth and authenticity.  What really sets this drama apart are the scenes of closeness and intimacy between the protagonists. They have this undeniable chemistry that sparks fireworks on screen. Every time they share a moment, my heart flutters, and I can't help but feel butterflies in my stomach. The way they convey emotions through subtle glances and tender touches is simply mesmerizing.  The production quality is impressive, with stunning cinematography and beautiful set designs that transport me into the world of the story. The writing is clever and balanced, blending moments of humor, romance, and heartfelt drama seamlessly. It's a rollercoaster of emotions, and I find myself fully invested in the characters' journeys.  Overall, this drama has exceeded my expectations. It's a gem that deserves recognition for its exceptional storytelling, brilliant performances, and the way it makes me feel deeply connected to the characters. I can confidently say that I am thoroughly enjoying every minute of it and eagerly waiting for the next episode. Highly recommended for all drama enthusiasts!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"I watched this seri as my friend who works in hotel services management recommended. The drama has lots of things about hotel services that we can learn from and also understand for the hotel staff. I did not expect more but watching it was beyond fun and exciting. It's like a piece of cake for the weekend. Yes, it's kinda classic icon of romance in K-drama but what's new is the way the character portrays. I have never seen a K-drama that points out other character so honest and realistic, such as the way the male lead asks for the female lead's permission before their first kiss; the way the female lead pointed out jealoucy is only from insecurity. I never see that in other dramas. This one defintely nailed it. Old but new!  Bonus, the drama has lots of beautiful nature scenes in Korea.  Can't wait for this piece of cake every weekend."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"This series is a very refreshing take on chaebol stories.  We don't get the typical cold, arrogant CEO male lead - instead, it's a cutely pathetic guy who would do anything for our female lead, even if it's a stupid thing to do.  And the female lead isn't the typical poor, damsel-in-distress lady. She is an excellent woman who knows a lot of languages and does well in her work.  There's a lot of funny moments which is well-balanced with the romantic scenes. I literally burst out laughing for a lot of the comedic scenes, which I typically don't do in ""comedy"" kdramas.  There are questionable decisions by the writer and director but honestly if you're not related to the issue, it's not even noticeable and doesn't affect the drama enjoyment.  It's a must-watch if you like light-hearted stories and want to take a break from heavy drama, murder, and complicated plotlines!  Not to mention that the leads have excellent visuals, so it's a treat to the eyes on a relaxing weekend :)"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"I have been watching K-dramas for more than 10 years now and this is one of the best rom-coms I have ever watched. The acting is superb and so natural. The male lead is actually a Baeksang Arts Awards Best Actor recipient so impeccable acting is as expected. The chemistry of the leads is just amazing as well as the great ensemble cast. Cinematography is beautiful & the OSTs are just heavenly to listen to. Every single episode is so funny and a joy to watch. I find myself smiling from ear to ear the whole time watching it. Whether you are a K-drama enthusiast or not, King the Land is a must see!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Watching this show really makes me smile and I look forward to the new episodes each weekend. There is a warmth and charm to it that is endearing. The early episode where both lead characters are a little tipsy is great, not overplayed - just right. Pity the ratings are so skewed. I am Scottish, we are often portrayed in an unrealistic/unflattering way, but they are depicting one character and not a whole country, most people are savvy enough to know it's a plot device and retain balance. This show does not deserve one star - comment on the individual episode not the whole thing if you are angry, give that episode your one star, the show deserves better, the leads are fantastic, really enjoying it."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"It's a good thing episodes only come out twice a week, otherwise I would have watched the entire series in one night. Or I would have tried to. This is my favorite K-Drama on Netflix currently and it makes all the other ones just seem boring. I also just learned the two main actors are idols! Cue the google deep dive.  This isn't one of the shows that likes to drag things on forever either, there is something happening to move the story along every episode. Each episode will leave you wanting more, especially after the eigth episode. Having to wait a whole seven days is going to be torture.  There's good chemistry between the leading couple, locations and settings are fantastic. There isn't much more you could want from a K-Drama about a hotel mogul's son falling in love with the star employee."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"The tension happened between Goo Won and Cheon makes me hooked for what might happen at the end. I like the tense inheritance fight between these two lovers, yet they need to kick out the bad feelings towards each other, and fight for whomever promised Cheon with wealth yet lack of good manners. I believe these who think they could buy your love for money are the worst, because she doesn't know what these kind of people what they have been doing with their people or family. One more step for Goo and he'll be at the edge of bad or good man, let's see what this season could bring to us with surprises."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Wonderful, fantastic cast, good silly with suspense, family, friends, plot twist, action, and that no beat around the bush funny grumpiness, that will make you laugh, 10, 10, 10 all the way, Mr No thumps up both of them, in fact the hole cast top to bottom is brilliant. We what more.  I would add I would wish for the show to be dubbed to English, sometimes the English subtitles go so quickly but still well worth the watch and read. Korean language and sounds are perfect as well .  The girlfriends stories and trip, love grandma, Prince Samir what a pick up just when your waiting for the next level in the story line.  Easy on the heart and mind, need more great shows like King the Land, Hometown Cha Cha Cha, 39, Strong Girl Nam Soon, Castaway Diva, Attorney Woo and so many more. We thank you all for the smiles."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"I don't write reviews for everything I watch, but I felt with the low ratings, I might offer a perspective.  I haven't seen many Korean romcoms - maybe I don't know any better - but King the Land made for the most delightful viewing experience.  It has things I love (which many dislike): cliche - slapstick - the oddest of sound effects - slow motion romance scenes - clean fun - adorableness - ridiculous situations   Also.  What I saw was an incredible role modelling of what it's like to be in customer service and how hard you can work to ensure each customer has a positive experience.  Initially the male character is perplexed by how hard our female lead works to a high level of excellence. This is slowly transformed through seeing how they truly love their work.  A point a review made was for the lack of cultural sensitivity. I can try to understand this view, but I honestly found the character they were referring to, to be lovable. That they are one of the only friends the male lead has, to me, tells me there is respect there (though playing into stereotypes - as they say perpetuating negative concepts - possibly would have been better playing into tropes instead... the character could have been from anywhere).  Then there are the friends and family. Their support and love for one another is a mark of unconditional love and I enjoyed each of their stories. The only character not showing the love the others do is the male character's sister. Who has her own deal going on.  The female lead has an opinion, and while she takes a while to figure out what she wants from life, she does so in her own way - not paying attention to the naysayers - really she was going along doing her own thing and the story happened to her until she took charge. I loved this plot.  I also honestly love the corny nature of the show was sucked into each episode making my hands into a heart shape to place around the characters -"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,9,,"The storyline is over-the-top cheese but it also reminds you that love can happen for anyone. I enjoyed that the story almost gives off impressions of ""if you work hard and live your life how you want, love will find its way to you.""  While the Arab scenes were cringey and inaccurate of cultures, it's not an accurate depiction of the show in its entirety. If you enjoyed Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha, King The Land will remind you of similar feelings. Lee Jun Ho and Im Yoon Ah have good chemistry and provide viewers with lots of hope.  As the header says - if you and your significant other are looking for a cheesy but feel-good story, this may be right up your alley."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"I really do not understand the low rating. But I agree with other reviewers who state that it is being review bombed for some reason. If you look at the reviews where people actually took the time to write comments vs just clicking a star, you'll see the positive reviews far out weigh the negative.  This was my first romantic Kdrama (I consider it my first Kdrama but since I did watch Squid Games first, I guess it actually holds that spot even though I didn't know what a Kdrama was when I watched it). But this series got me hooked on Kdrama's. I do not feel like there is anything being created in the US that compares. I love the slow paced romance based on small gestures of kindness vs just sex as is so common with US dramas. And I really like how they do not drag out the relationship setback misunderstandings...those usually get resolved within the beginning of the next episode if not the same episode.  But within King The Land, I really liked the strength in Sa-rang's character. How she quickly dealt with adversity herself rather than waiting for Gu Won or someone else to save her. I thought Im Yoon-ah did a great job with the character as did the other actors in the core group. I also liked the balance given between the main romantic thread between Sa-rang and Gu Won and that of the secondary romantic threads for Sa-rang's friends, Oh Pyeong-hwa and Kang Da-eul. I thought they gave enough time to the secondary threads to properly evolve them without taking away from the primary story.  While this was my 'first', it will be far from my last Kdrama. I'm currently hooked and will be exploring all that the various streaming services have to offer in this category."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS SHOW ! I was sad that it ended it needs another season ! It was so cute and addicting to watch, some parts were sad but it was good overall. People need to give this tv show a chance, I might rewatch it all over again! Can't get enough. I loved how this story came together and how it ended I was teary eyed. But there should be an another season for the rest of the cast to see where it goes for them as well! I'd like to see what would happen next with them and hopefully see noh sang sik finally find his girl would be pretty cute to see too ! But over all you should watch."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"This show was really amazing. There was no over-acting, no loopholes in the storry, no silly script lines. All main and supporting characters were well written. Recommending it 100%.  I loved the idea of friend group of 6. Both main female and male characters' friends and their side stories were nice. The chemistry between main leads were perfect, not to mention how charming they both were. All cast was very talented.  Some people gave low score, being critical on Arab prince character depiction. But it was also one of the nicest supporting characters. I did not think they were being offensive as this character was not representing everyone from Middleeast. It was same, way like script was written to make main male character depicted as spoilt rich Korean man who was scared of everything, as it did not represent all Korean rich executives."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Just Beautiful! I love everything in this serie, it is to easy to watch, refreshing, funny and so sweet, I don't want all the drama as well in fiction, I just watched it for second time in three weeks and really I could repeat it all again, the chemistry between the main characters was WoW!! He is a Prince charming I love him! But definitely I love her as well they are perfect together. I live the development of the characters, a touch of glamour and sympathy, is impossible not being attached to this serie. I hope others can enjoy it, sadly the ratings are not showing the real colour of this lovely k drama."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"This is a must watch rom-com kdrama!  For sure was head and shoulders above the Business Proposal.  Cast: 10 of 10 Storyline: 10 of 10 Only 2 episodes moved a little slow, but i was totally fine with that. Pacing was perfect for the rest of the episodes.  I loved allllllll the characters and wish they would've made a season 2.  The comedy did make me laugh out loud a few times esp the scenes with the Saudi Prince. The ML & FL chemistry was off the charts beautiful. I enjoyed every twist and turn along the way. I cried at some moments. It was def very well thought out and written with no hurried ending. Didn't leave many wondering at the end. I like nice tied endings.  If you like kdramas like my demon, nevertheless, business proposal.. I promise you'll love this one! 💖"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,8,,I loved this drama so much. It was so full of romance with comedy and drama.  The leads were perfect and their chemistry was a bliss to watch. I was so sad it ended but it ended so well and OMG their wedding 💑 🔥  I just did not like the side stories that much mostly the air hostess which was quite boring at some point. Otherwise their characters were amazing. Not to forget the kisses 😘 They were so steamy and the right timing. The career path and career choice for Sarang was also well put.  Ofc cannot forget the outstanding OST which made us feel like being in a dream all the time.  Recommend if you love a romcom. It's swoonworthy ❤
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,9,,"King the Land is a genuinely enjoyable drama, and I'm surprised by the low ratings. The storyline may follow familiar tropes - enemies to lovers, office romance - but it's done with warmth and great chemistry between the leads.  Some scenes are truly fun, and the supporting characters (especially the male lead's assistant) are spot-on and add a nice comedic touch.  Yes, it could have been a few episodes shorter (some parts feel unnecessarily stretched) but overall, it's a light and satisfying watch.  If you're looking for a breezy K-drama to binge and lift your mood, this one is definitely worth it."

킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"I dont know why there is low ratings.. But I would give more than a 10 if there was. Honestly I fell in love with the actress.. she had played such an outstanding role.. .very real expressions and all her friends.. I could say even the actor played very nice bold characters and soft. Not like other actors who would act like very kid behaviour .. I have seen some 40 + actors playing teen characters but that was not teen it was like kids character I would love to see them married. And series of them. Please make this Sequel also. I am shocked never b4 seen such actings like she expressed in every kind of situation.. wow.. all the characters played very well.. And main thing is thanks to the dubbing masters which they really made this series wow.. This is my, I would say 2nd most loved series.. first one is Money Heist. When the dubbing is good,series will be more good. If you are reading my comment then go for it . It brings you smile 😊 and flash backs that you have not done b4. Today 04Apr/2025."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Such a Sweet and Comforting kdrama for your soul with Non-Complicated Plot,i dont understand the low ratings,i like watching healthy relationships..The storyline flows smoothly, allowing you to immerse yourself in the characters' lives without getting lost in unnecessary twists. Goo Won and Cheon Sa-rang stole my heart! Such a sweet couple..the love and respect they have for each other and great level of understanding..the way they look at each other and smile ohh my god what else you want in your life partner! Their connection feels genuine and relatable. Lim yoona has been my favourite since i watched k2 and now i got my new crush Lee Junho..loved every episode ,The ost is also good... Absolutely worth watching!!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,9,,"If you are looking for a fulfilling romance plot then you are in the right place! The chemistry between the lead actors is absolutely heart-throbbing to watch and they are eye candy as well!  However, the show has made one fatal mistake. They not only introduced an Arab prince using an actor who is not Arab himself, but they also proceeded to offend Arab culture on a large scale. I genuinely hope that we can hear an apology from the director himself.  I am giving the lead actors a 9/10. The director is a 2/10 for misrepresenting Arab culture although the rest of the show had great potential.  If only, if only this mistake hadn't been made-I would totally recommend everyone to watch it for the beautiful romance and video production!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"This Korean drama series is heart-warming, heart-fluttering, and funny. But there's an intra-family inheritance war - not violent, just scheming-heavy.  The filming locations are very beautiful (South Korea, United Kingdom and Thailand), so there are a lot of good views to enjoy.  King The Land also provides an opening to discussions about working conditions of women in particular, in service industries, and how they balance that out from day to day.  Follow Won, Sarang and their friends SangSik, Pyeonghwa, DaEul and RoWoon as they figure out what a smile truly means, while navigating their work and love lives."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"This is the a nice drama for you to watch after a long day at school/work. Most of the plot is predictable but it still worth to watch especially the chemistry between both main leads. I watched all the recent episodes (8) and there wasn't any part that was boring, there are a lot of comedy in the drama which help me to stay focus. You can see how Gu Won change himself overtime with the help of Sa Rang and the romance between these two is amazing too. The development of the relationship between Gu Won and Sa Rang is great too. Overall, this drama is a comfy type and fun to watch, the relationship between all characters is great too. Worth to watch it if you like romance."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,9,,"This is such a good drama. If you want to have a pleasant time, watched it's funny, cute and romantic. YoonA and Junho have really good chemistry and their acting is really good.  It has really good moments between the characters and if you watch the BTS you'll see YoonA and Junho's input on their characters, some of the lines are ad-libs the actors improvised  I'm mostly impressed by Junho's acting, he pays a lot of care to his character you'll be surprised  My issues with this drama was the way they portrayed Arab people, was really disrespectful hope the the writes and production team apologize for this."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"It was a funny sad and romantic story just what you need from a k drama. All the actors were brilliant- I laughed cried and was happy with the whole storyline it was very well written and acted and probably would watch again!  The plot was typical but with a twist, there were some great moments between all the character's which had you gasping laughing or crying the scenery was wonderful and it transported me to Seoul x.  I especially loved the friendship between the girls and the main female character wish we could all have the love and support they showed each other. I could see another season following their lives it would be amazing."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,9,,"I'm still on episode 8, but this is a sweet quirky story of boy-meets-girl Cinderella story. It's lighthearted, quirky, fun. Well acted, he stares at her... music... she stares at him... music. He's the knight in shinning armor, classic prince that wants to rescue his princess. Fun story that makes you forget about the world. It gets better and better with every episode. I like it because it's lighthearted. No trauma, no who's gonna get slashed in half this week. Really light comedy. I have worked in retail and hotels and I can relate to some of the plotlines. Easy to enjoy. This is an old school romance story."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,8,,"King the Land starting out with some scenes & dialogues similar to the hit series ""Business Proposal"" But if you just stay with it, the story does get more enchanting & interesting. It's worthwhile of your time.  The lead female role Sa Rang was played by the actress who's naturally beautiful with definitely sweet, charming smiles and dynamic personality. Her strong performances are convincing.  The leading man Won, is a more complex figure.  He started out as a cold, distant ( appears to be a bitter person) angry man. Not a likable person initially.  However, with each episode rolled along, he became different person, much more likable.  The ending was certainly very satisfying, even more satisfying than the series "" Business Proposal """
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,8,,"Storyline is not much but the romance between the MC & FC is lively and cute. Enjoyed watching LJH for the first time. Hope to watch more drama with him in them.  Story is based on a hotel where big sister is the managing Director and younger brother returns from overseas to play thus part. He meets a young and energetic concierge who dreams to be the best concierge she can be. Their lives intertwine and things start happening to them and around them, impacting their daily lives.  I enjoyed the constant battle and let's be friends afterwards - story line.  Rich or poor - love makes the world go around."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"I'm no expert, I can't tell u oh lord this series have x and y elements necessary to create the perfect climax or yada yada. No, from my opinion as a viewer it's fun and entertaining, has drama, comedy, romance. The scene of the guy's fake laugh was gold lmao. The plot is good, I'm waiting for them people to announce the second series. I think that the people voting 5/10 are weird as if they.could write a better story come on this time most of things are already invented and too many things can be foreseen because they already happened in 4-5 other series. Is not like oh let's be creative let's make something new."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"I am Asian American 2nd generation.  I ""fell in love"" with King The Land.  I just found this K-Drama two days before our Netflix subscription ending.  So I binged watched non-stop. It was well worth my well-being of sleeplessness. Hee-hee :) Thank you and cheers 🍻 to love rom-com!  Blessings to the cast 'from the bottom of my heart' <3. Keep bringing the draft beers to all of you. It will be my treat. Kindly bill it to my suite!  I found this drama delightful. The world needs this kind of happiness right now. Many thank yous. If there I a next season to King The Land, I certainly would subscribe to Netflix. Stay well all of you!  Kind Regards, Mary Ann."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"I'm not understanding how this show ended up with such low ratings. This is one feel-good k-drama I can keep coming back to, and it instantly became a favorite. It is SO cute and just makes me feel so happy and warm and fuzzy. With any show, there is room for improvement but you're never going to make everyone happy. For me, this is probably my favorite k-drama now, and for sure in my top 3. I've already rewatched it and plan to many times! When I'm having a bad day, this is the one. From beginning to end I loved it. I'm hoping ratings will improve as more people give it a chance and put in some positive input."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,,,"So this starts off great. It immediately creates the perfect cozy romcoms vibes, with a pinch of mystery. The leads are great, the chemistry is chemistrying. There is some really good enemies to lovers situation going on that gets you hooked. HOWEVER. There is a big however here. And it starts right after the leads get together. Cause then that's it. It's literally not interesting anymore. It's like watching a couple's moments and at some point it's tiring and absolutely boring. I stopped watching, then I decided to continue cause I don't like leaving shows midway. But I couldn't. And trust me, I tried."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Their chemistry is very suitable and beautiful, the story is beautiful and fun. Cheon Sarang with her kind personality, always positive and cheerful, truly describes her as a true angel, Yoona succeeded in playing her, as did Gu Won Lee Junho. The whole story is really cool and exciting, I even keep rewatching it.. so You all must watch it."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"King the Land was such a joy to watch! This is my first time writing a review for a show and it's only because I honestly don't understand the low ratings. This show delivered everything I was hoping for. The chemistry between the leads is absolutely magnetic, and their relationship felt so natural and heartfelt. On top of that, all of the characters were wonderful - each one brought something unique that made the story even more enjoyable.  More than anything, it was a true escape from all the chaos in the world - warm, funny, and romantic in the best way. Sometimes we just need a story that makes us feel good, and King the Land did exactly that. Highly recommended for anyone who wants a sweet, uplifting watch."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,8,,"This series was my first K-drama & it was a great one to start me off. I got to learn that: the romance develops slowly; conglomerate (chaebol) families are about money & power over love; drunkenness is common, especially when soju is concerned; food is such an essential part of Korean life.  The 2 lead actors (Lee Jun-ho & Im Yoon-ah) have a chemistry that is essential to make the viewers believe they are experiencing the aspects of a relationship. He becomes very sweet in how protective & attentive he is to her. Her character nicely develops from this apologising servant to a more assertive business woman.  The supporting crew of the 4 'siblings' were great, especially his assistant & the airline hostess. She has been a hostess before in another series (Love to Hate You) so she has it down pat!  I liked that they travelled somewhere outside Korea so we got to see another interesting culture.  Overall, it was basically a 'Cinerella story' but an enjoyable one."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,9,,"A simple drama with a plot reminiscent of Business Proposal or What's Wrong with Secretary Kim. It's a sweet love story with a happy ending, perfect if you want a romance without major misunderstandings between the main couple. The chemistry between Gu Won and Cheon Sa-Rang is incomparable. I've watched this kdrama twice and I think I'll rewatch it someday."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,9,,"It is one of the nicest television series of all time I have ever watched I would like to recommend them all With this it has the nice chemistry between the starring im yoon ah So called cheon sa rang and Gu won The story stats from enemy ending upto friends leaving it most successful turn that I have watched previously on business proposal.  So for those who want to watch best chemistry staring from enemy to ending upto lovers this is the best season and tv series to get watch My rating to 9 out of 10 purely rely on how they make viewers to get excited for what next ,is going to happen makes this as one of the most compatible."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"How can such a beautiful series be rated so low? Honestly, this is one of the best romantic series I've ever come across! It's also my first K-drama-and I'm so glad I started with this one. Now I'm officially a K-drama fan!  The cast is absolutely amazing, especially the lead actor and actress, they look perfect together and have incredible chemistry. I'm really hoping for a Season 2, but even if it doesn't happen, I'm satisfied because Season 1 ended so beautifully.  Also, the background music is so soothing, I've already added it to my playlist!  Please give this show a watch! You won't regret it."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Such a lovely and cute story, with a lot of fun moments throughout the episodes. I love the music and the characters as well. Cried a lot in the end and definitely have to watch it all over again. I'm pretty new to Korean shows, but I love the culture and I really like to see something else than the usual American romantic comedies. This is by far the best Korean tv show I have seen and definitely some of my favorites of all. I have noticed that Netflix got a lot of Korean shows, so I can't wait to see if there's anything that can compete with this show.  Also this really make me dream of visiting Seoul."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"The best feel good story I saw since a long time. Nothing realistic, it's in fact a real Cinderella story.  It's funny as well and you would love to have friends like she does.  Love the work environment of the series too.  OMG, what a passionate first kiss. And don't know how long ago it was I saw such passion in a K-drama. In fact I don't know I ever saw so much passion in a K-drama. I really really loved it. And what a gentleman ""Do I have permission?"" If you want a love story that gives you a man who would do everything for his woman, watch King the Land. You won't be disappointed at all!!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Even the sadest scene is taken with refreshing, delightful, beautiful, heart full. I loved this so hard. Netflix put a lot of efforts to create or recreation of scenes. And the Camera Work is so so much far better and I happened to visit Thailand due to Netflix in King the land. While watching one charming scene you can say that ""wow amazing"" but wait, there's another, another, another, another, another, another! Overall idk y's rating so down. If it doesn't contain scenes from your country doesn't mean you can unfairly judge sach a humble-charming K-drama...! I just was so so impressed by Netflix's Work 🤞🏼👍🏼🙌🏼"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"A delightful romantic comedy that hits all the right notes, earning a well-deserved 10/10. Starring Lee Jun-ho as Gu Won, the charming yet initially aloof heir to the luxurious King Hotel, and Im Yoon-ah as Cheon Sa-rang, a hardworking and bubbly hotelier, this drama delivers a heartwarming blend of romance, humor, and workplace dynamics. From the outset, the chemistry between the leads is electric. Lee Jun-ho's portrayal of Gu Won is both charismatic and nuanced, capturing his transformation from a cold, business-driven chaebol to a man softened by love. Im Yoon-ah's Sa-rang is a breath of fresh air-her infectious optimism and resilience make her endlessly relatable and rootable. Their enemies-to-lovers arc is executed flawlessly, with playful banter and tender moments that will leave you swooning. The drama shines in its pacing and storytelling. Spanning 16 episodes, it balances romance with subplots about friendship, ambition, and family ties. The supporting cast, including Gu Won's loyal friends and Sa-rang's quirky colleagues, adds depth and humor without overshadowing the main storyline. The workplace setting at King Hotel is vibrant, with stunning visuals that highlight the opulence of the hospitality industry while grounding it in Sa-rang's earnest perspective. What sets *King The Land* apart is its feel-good vibe. It avoids unnecessary melodrama, focusing instead on heartfelt connections and lighthearted conflicts. The show tackles themes of class differences and personal growth with a gentle touch, making it both entertaining and meaningful. The soundtrack, with its catchy and emotional tunes, perfectly complements the mood, while the cinematography elevates every romantic scene to cinematic heights. Humor is another highlight-Gu Won's deadpan wit paired with Sa-rang's playful energy creates laugh-out-loud moments that never feel forced. The drama also excels in its depiction of strong friendships, particularly Sa-rang's bond with her two best friends, which adds warmth and relatability. *King The Land* is a masterclass in romantic comedies, offering a perfect escape with its swoon-worthy romance, lovable characters, and uplifting narrative. It's a drama that leaves you smiling long after the credits roll, making it an absolute must-watch for K-drama fans. 10/10 for delivering pure joy from start to finish!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,9,,"King the Land is a very sweet and enjoyable drama. The story is quite typical, but the plot is still interesting and keeps you watching. The actors are really cute and funny, and their chemistry makes the scenes even more entertaining. They bring a lot of charm and energy to the series.  The atmosphere of the drama is light, pleasant, and very comfortable to watch. Everything feels natural, and it's easy to relax and enjoy the story without stress. The combination of humor, romance, and small surprises makes the drama fun from start to finish.  Overall, I really liked King the Land. It's a warm and enjoyable series with lovable characters, a charming story, and a cozy atmosphere. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a lighthearted and entertaining drama."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"It's worth watching you can enjoy every moment of this drama show it's a rom com that reminds me a lot of those old school kdramas, reminded me a bit of what's wrong with secretary kim, I don't know why!  The plot is no complicated and it's filled with with sweet scenes, silly comedy and funny moments.  I loved to see The actor playing Prince Samir back again! ( heartbreaking when I watched Squid Game! ) he was fantastic here too)  I like the chemistry between the leads and you will be glad to find NO dead fish kisses in this drama whatsoever.  And the die hard friendship between the three girl friends and how they are always there for each other was awesome as well.  Overall very enjoyable! You shouldn't t miss it.😁"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"Even if everything seems to happen much slower than an american series, it kept me very interested. It was such a beautiful love story! I think that everyone would like such a partner. I want season 2. It's been a long time since I've watched a series with such a desire to see what will happen next. The actors are very handsome, especially the boy. I experienced such beautiful feelings through this mini series. There are differences in approach, but we adopted one and it is normal to be like that, being a series made in another culture. Everything was much more innocent and I liked it very much."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"The series is amazing. Only good feelings, some laughs and lots of romance. Just bc the Arab prince wasn't an arab speaking person made this show to have low rating. But it's an amazing story.i loved every part of it.from beginning to the end it makes you feel happy. Loved both the male and female lads, they have good chemistry."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,10,,"King the Land is an absolute delight from the very first episode to the last. The chemistry between the leads is beyond perfect-effortless, natural, and filled with moments that make your heart skip a beat. The comedy is sharp and genuinely funny, the romance is beautifully developed, and the emotional beats are sincere without being overdone. Every scene is visually stunning, the acting is flawless, and the balance between lighthearted fun and heartfelt drama is masterfully handled. It's a feel-good series that leaves you smiling long after it ends. A flawless 10/10 watch!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,9,,"I loved this show.  Amid the complicated and overrated series this one is fresh, easy to watch, funny and addicting.  I'm glad they did 16 episodes, they are not dull and each episode has it's own story.  The only thing that I would want to say is that it's a pure fiction. Most of the depicted events, actions and dialogs are NEVER meant to happen in South Korea with their strict society.  I highly recommend to give this show a chance. Definitely it's not everyone's cup of tea, but if you are tired of endless blood-driving movies and series this can be a good option to switch to something bright and promising."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,3,,"... and not in a good way.  It has all the tropes belonging to a shoujo and while that has its charm as a comic aimed at teens... for a live action its just extremely outdated and boring.  Everything is predictable, there is zero tension in the story. It almost needs a brutal death of any of the characters to balance out the sugar and sweet dripping from it and a doubt even that would be enough ... its just the wrong genre for a massacre.  The acting is fine, though it truly does not feel like much acting is happening. Rather I feel like I am watching two friends hanging out in a project that would be fun for them (no hard feelings) but sadly not fun for anyone watching."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,2,,"I'm sure there are a lot of good screenwriters in Korea, so why the decision to decide to adapt this terrible, deplorable script to the screen. Is nobody on the side of the station, the director. Actors had not even a moment of reflection that they would undertake the impossible to present this incredibly boring story. I watched a few episodes and I can't count how many times I rolled my eyes seeing these clichés, then I fast-forwarded, finally dropped this series. I realized I was just wasting my time on this nonsense, I'd say I feel sorry for the actors who had to play it, but for some of them all that matters is the pay if they choose to put their names on it."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,2,,"I didn't expect Korean drama to be so bad. I watched many productions from this country which were very good like King's Affection, Business Proposal, Tomorrow, Stranger. Despite the different genres, each of these series had a good script and actors who understood their roles well and delivered a quality product. That's why I'm surprised that such a poor quality drama as King The Land appeared on Netflix. The poster itself surprised me, very in the style of poor quality Hallmark productions. But I gave this series a chance and watched a total of 10 episodes, I made it this far only because I wanted to give this series a chance to develop. Unfortunately, the script is very weak, the episodes are dragged out and just boring, the main cast are rather not professional actors because I don't believe that a trained actor wouldn't manage to bring a bit of reality and honesty to the scenes. The romcom genre is often based on cliché but here it is absolutely indigestible. If I had to point out the weakest point aside from the terrible script, I have to unfortunately point to Female Lead, there is no effort in her case to bring her character to life, which remains flat and papery. Dear production companies please hire good writers, nothing can save a drama if the writing is lacking."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,1,,"One of the worst, didnt even know low budgeted show srill exists, It's 2023 and I cannot believe we are being subjected to such irrational nonsense, that is King the Land. This series is a hotspotch of the usual tried and rested boring rich boy poor girl formulas with nothing new or exciting to offer. 3 episodes in and I cannot watch it anymore. I am so disappointed as I was looking forward to this show and really wanted to love it. After 'Red Sleeve' and 'Big Mouth' I cannot understand why they would do such a bad show. The script and screenplay is just the same tried and tested chaebol/simple girl formula. I am sure the high reviews are for GG's Yoona and 2PM's Junho. They are the only reason I am giving this 2 stars."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,2,,"The rom-com genre is all about humor, characters you can relate to, good chemistry between the actors, and cute writing. In the case of this drama, none of these elements were delivered. In principle, this drama has no plot, so the viewer gets bored very quickly, especially when the characters are flat, in the case of a good script, the characters go through a path, learn, develop, here everything stands still and leads to nothing. The humor elements are pathetic, the number of cringe moments is overwhelming. The main leads do not show any effort to make their characters even a little human, the second leads are a bit more interesting, but it is still not enough to interest even the undemanding viewer."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,1,,"It is important for me to share my candid opinion because as a moviegoer, I value high-quality films that are able to captivate and entertain. In this instance, I felt that the film failed to deliver on both fronts. The storyline lacked depth and coherence, making it difficult for me to engage with the narrative. Furthermore, the performances seemed lackluster and uninspired, failing to bring the characters to life in a compelling way, Additionally, the technical aspects of the film left much to be desired. The cinematography and editing did not showcase the expertise and attention to detail I have come to expect from movies of this genre. This, unfortunately, detracted from my overall viewing experience and further compounded my disappointment."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,1,,"Please don't make my mistake this is the Worst time I ever spent on anything in my life, awful show bad acting less than bad directing and even a horrible horrible horrible horrible story there is no facts no story lines or journey just words that doesn't make any sense even the lighting and sound was bad, sticking a fork in to your eyes repeatedly over and over again would be a much more entertainment experience I highly recommend doing that instead of watching "" King the land "" even the name doesn't make any sense it's a book you could judge from its cover, sincerely, Someone who looks out for you ."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,1,,"In the last two years, i have seen my share of kdramas, but nothing as bad as King the Land.  I got hooked to kdramas because of the original and creative premisses (Attorney Woo), strong and consistent storyline (Red sleeve) or light but funny romcoms (Business Proposal). Even super light shows like secretary Kim, so light that i dropped it, feels like a Shakespeare play compared to the void that is King land.  I was just stunned by the poor writing and especially by the stale humour, isn't a romCOM supposed to be even slightly funny. I hanged on for several episodes, pressing fast foward on the frequent cringy scenes , and finaly quit in ep10, the worst episode ever of kdrama history for me.  I could not believe that in this day and age, an 1hour tv show would offer absoluting nothing as a story. It´s a compilation of promos for tourism in thailand, glamour pointeless shots of the lead actors and a string of unbearable cute/funny/giddy sequences with the cast, that could be from a B-rated US sitcom from the 70´s.  The humour here is simply appalling and It´s painfull to watch good actors lost in this degrading and meanlingess episode.  What's next, for the second season you don´t even have to pay a writter, the producer only has to mix some glamour stills shots off the lead actors, a PowerPoint presentation with ""happy"" moments of a random cast of actors who look funny and a promo video from the board of tourism of the country who pays better."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,1,,"I watch far too many Korean dramas, but this is not one of them. There are plenty better dramas available. The story is uninteresting, and the series is a waste of time. The personnel is unpredictable, and the work quality makes you feel like you're watching a show from the 2000s. It was never something I enjoyed. I strongly advise not watching it. I was not expecting to see such a poor job on this cheek, especially considering the quality of Korean series has improved in this period. This is extremely terrible and disheartening. Regardless matter whether the dialogue is imbalanced and lacks a sense of humor, the filming must be evaluated before transmission. The issue."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,2,,"It's 2023 and I can't believe we're being subjected to such irrational nonsense this is king of the earth.

I'm so disappointed because I was looking forward to this show and really wanted to love it. After ""Red Sleeve"" and ""Big Mouth"" I can't understand why they put on such a bad show.

킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,3,,Its funny. They spent more on food then they did with anything else.  Beer and food. Thats it!!!!!!  The stars r cute but everything else is sooo over done. Ten episodes in and still confused over them being real siblings or step. No substance to it.  The poor actor and actress - they made them go soooo over the top......everything is sweet but silly. No reality feel.  I wish they didnt have to over do it in every episode and i wish it was more real. Too much drama. Unnecessary and a drag.  Such a cute star cast cud have been alot better. Unfortunately was just a waste if time. So unfortunate!!!!!
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,1,,"The show has no originality, it's the worst show I've ever seen, it's a waste of time, I want my time back. The time the story was so trivial, there is nothing in it that would get bored from the first second, the show was so awkward that they tried to add some funny clips, but it was so awkward that I felt like I wanted to cry instead of laughing. Forced nothing was normal. I don't feel sorry for the actors either, they read the script and approved of it.  They used a hotel as the basis for the show, which has been used several times. I can think of 3 off the top of my head who lied to me, encounter, and hotel kings. I have no clue why hotels are used as stories for TV in Korean society."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,1,,"No plot , no chemistry , no good acting , no good supporting roles ,no reason of existence, not even something good to tell about. Only cringy moments , repetitive and boring dialogues , travels with no reason and a continual exposition of wealth.  After watched it , I still keep quenstioning myself , what was all the hype for? I thought I was watching a parody or something like that. The storyline seemed badly written , like it was written by a teenager. The scenario team tried to focus on kissing scenes ...but all of these ,without a romantic background or even a plot , was simply cringe and corny.  Bad bad bad....pitty for Junho , he did great work in Red Sleeve."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,1,,"So boring , couldn't pass two episodes.after.  It was showing that it from the very good rating Korean series in Netflix at the beginning however I start watching it and I couldn't set watching longer so I stopped many times and said that iam going to try later as maybe my mood wasn't good that time but unfortunately I couldn't continue.  I think that the Korean drama these days becoming so commercial they want to finish many and many series as they can without any actual evens in the series it self.  Finally I do not recommend any one to wast time or effort watching this series at all.  Thank you."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,1,,"Among the ongoing telecasting drama in Korea, i think this is the lousiest storyline and absolutely wasting Lee Junho's acting talent. Lee Junho deserves for better role and script. The worst part is KTL keep stealing some ideas and script from Junho's previous successful production, The Red Sleeve. TRS is a precious and worth for 5 stars drama, sorry not for KTL. To KTL production team, don't steal someone 's credit to your stage. The viewers are not blind. If Lee Junho not participate in KTL, i doubt this drama will go far. I hope he will make a right choice in his next project and he deserves it."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,1,,"This whole show is like a TikTok videos edit by a horny webtoon/wattpad-loving female teenager. It's full of slow-mo staring at each other, holding each others' hands, hugging, kissing, saying hoo haa at food and buildings. The script writing was so plain and sounded like something you read off of a quick google search on ""what to say to a guy/girl you like?"" So painful and I had to fast forward a lot of scenes because they were just boring.  Just because two people are very good looking, doesn't mean they can act or have great chemistry, because they definitely did not in this drama. Two street cats fighting on the street would even look romantic and sweet if they are on slow-mo with romantic music ballad in the background.  I am more invested in the the two best friends stories than the leads. They are much better actresses and their story lines are much more interesting.  This whole show is a huge miss, not even close to Business Proposal and I did not even like Business Proposal that much. King The Land offers nothing, no thick plot, no climax, it is simply a Yoo Na-Jun Ho fan excuse to make a lot of video edits of them put together into one whole boring show that should have been called ""Yoo Na & Jun Ho Together Clips""."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,1,,"Just boring to watch over-all. No storyline to follow. The highlight per episode seems to be the enigmatic smile of the male lead. Apart from that, nothing else is exciting. After the 2nd episode, watched the rest on fast forward. The power struggle between the two protagonists (brother and sister) is not given depth and substance, and it's such a waste because this series seems to have very strong lead characters. The female lead Yoona, is also weak and shows mediocre acting abilities in this series. I truly hope the 2nd set of 8 episodes will be more fast-paced and will show a much improved storyline. 1 Star over-all. 2 stars foe actors."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,1,,"This show fails to bring anything new to the table, lacking originality from start to finish. Episodes 5 and 6 were particularly disappointing, leading me to lose interest entirely. As a dedicated K-drama fan, I can't help but feel let down by the lazy writing and direction employed by the team behind this production. Even the talented actors cannot be excused for their involvement, as they had prior knowledge that this format offered nothing innovative or fresh. The choice of using a hotel as the central theme has been overdone countless times before in Korean dramas such as ""Lie To Me,"" ""Encounter,"" and ""Hotel Kings."" It remains unclear why hotels seem to be an incessant source of inspiration for storytelling in Korean society. The attempts at comedy felt forced throughout, lacking any sense of naturalness. In fact, background sounds were even used excessively in an attempt to enhance comedic moments - a cringe-worthy decision. Regrettably, after enduring six episodes with little enjoyment or engagement, I have made the decision not to continue watching this series. Six episodes proved sufficient enough for me to provide an honest review that reflects my disappointment with its lackluster execution."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,1,,"The Series began well but, unfortunately, lost its way halfway through with a weak plot and storyline. In particular, the episode featuring the Thailand trip had poor cinematography and a poorly written script, making it unenjoyable. It seems the Thailand tourism department sponsored that episode because it was pretty dull and unnecessary - What a bummer.  Furthermore, it was strange that the villa was booked for six people but only had two rooms to share for six people - poor writing, there  Overall, it is worth watching if you have nothing else to do. It could serve as background noise while you clean the house, but it won't keep you engaged."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,1,,"This is my first time rating a show, and unfortunately, it will be a negative one. I couldn't finish the series because it was just that bad. Nothing charmed me, and the acting felt exaggerated. There was no chemistry between the main characters, and their performances were so poor that they seemed like beginners who didn't deserve leading roles! The performances of the secondary characters, like her friends and the main character's sister, were much better. There was nothing that made the main characters admirable, and any admiration they had for each other completely came out of nowhere.  The main storyline about working in a hotel is interesting, but it wasn't executed well, and the casting for the main roles was poorly done.  If there were a rating lower than 1, I would give it. I can't believe how popular this show has become, with people recommending it as a must-watch!"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,1,,"First time when i saw rating here on imdb i was thinking something is wrong, because k dramas never been so low with rating. But no...people are right! This show is so predictable, shallow, cliche it's really bad! Always arrogant rich male, poor girl, classic Cinderella story. We all know how it's gonna end. I am so disappointed as I was looking forward to this show and really wanted to love it. I couldn't even finish episode 1 and I am a romantic comedy fan. If I could rate this a little more than 1, I would. I can't believe I spent my precious hours trying to watch it.  Lesson learned: Just because a drama and the actors in it are popular doesn't mean it's good."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,1,,"The first episode seemed promising. The plot is about the hotel. But as each episode goes on, it turns out to be strictly a love story instead? The story line lost me and left me uninterested to view the rest of the episodes. If I wanted to watch a love story, I would have watch something else. I thought it was a drama with some comedy mixed? This is forced comedy at its best (Bad script) and a obvious love story which leaves nothing to look forward to! (Very predictable) I don't want to give anything away as you can watch it and judge for yourself. I'll bet you can predict whats going to happen next without any spoilers?"
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,1,,"I've watched a lot of bad series but I've never seen anything as disgusting and disrespectful as this series.  The script is atrocious, the acting is terrible the pacing of the film is also extremely poorly balanced,Absolutely everything in this series is terrible.  This series doesn't even have a ""guilty pleasure"" factor like Sharknado or the room I wonder how anyone read the script for this series and thought ""wow this story is amazing""And decided to produce this cinematic atrocity.  Again,DONT watch the series for your good health and life I'm sure you will have heart attack ASAP.  SAVE YOUR TIME."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,1,,"It was totally cringey for me. Romance is one of my favorite tv series genres but I think this is too much for me. I watched up until episode 2 and could not even finish it because I wondered what the hype was all about.  The characters are so corny, and the things they do do not make sense. It is just the same old rom-com formula with no originality or something that makes it rise above anything else. I have watched others with the same formula and I loved them but I don't know why I just could not get past 1 more minute watching this show.  I am curious why it is at the top ten watched shows but I guess not curious enough to continue watching. Bye2 King the Land I am off to a new series and I hope it is not as terrible as you."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,5,,"Low-class, hard working girl enters her dream job in a luxurious hotel and through her efforts raises the ranks. She also meets the son of the boss, who falls in love with her: they work through a few but minor obstacles to fulfill their love. There is also a minor mystery involving the male lead's past life.  It's a romantic comedy between the poor but good girl and the rich boy who is also her boss: nothing much different from other romcoms, such as ""What's wrong with secretary Kim?"" or ""Business Proposal"". If you go in this series expecting nothing too revolutionary, but just a lighthearted watch, you will enjoy the show. Also, the ending, while not being ground-breaking, is a slight twist on the usual tropes of the genre.  Is it a bad series? Not at all, it does not deserve all the hate it gets. Is it a great romcom series? Not the best, not the worst; if you like the genre, probably ""Business Proposal"" is a better choice.  So why did I give it only 5/10? Because with series like ""Mr. Queen"" and ""Crashlanding on you"" on the scene, this rating is the correct one in perspective."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,2,,"Korean Drama "" King The Land "" is a romantic comedy with two strong leads.  The drama has a smooth start, with a story that brings back nostalgic feelings for the old Korean romantic comedies that ruled the last decade and even before that. The romance is sweet and the banter between the leads is adorable and entertaining. The friendship was also an enjoyable factor.  However, everything went downhill when the two leads got together, which happened early on. Thus, the drama was left to deal with romantic dates, traveling abroad, and some family drama, which at least kept things interesting here and there but was too predictable to be able to save the drama.  Other than the boring plot, however, the performances kept being strong, and the main couple had chemistry.  So, overall, two and a half out of ten."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,1,,"I don't recommend that this drama. Don't waste your precious time. You will regret wasting it.  Cliche stories and implausible story development. The level is so low that I don't know if the author actually wrote it.  Compared to other Korean dramas, the level is so low that it is difficult to watch and the content that disparaged other cultures was also very bad.  I had high expectations for a Korean drama, but I was so disappointed.  It's kind of hard to give a rating. If time is precious, I hope you don't watch this drama.  I hope that please don't make dramas like this in the future and look forward to high quality Korean dramas."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,1,,"I'll be honest. 1st episode was good and therefore my expectatios had grown but after the 5th episode I left it.  The premises were good but the scenes are absolutely empty, the script is ridicuolous, dialogues are ridiculous that it's almost cringe.  To summarize it's boring, because it's almost predicting.  They didn't bring anything new to the table: a rich, cold and arrogant chaebol, an hotel, a girl who work hard to earn a living, humble and sweet who will change his mind, they'll marry and have kids (?) I guess because I did not finished it.  Don't let famous actors fool you and think this is a good drama, because I am sorry but it is not."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,1,,"I just started this K-drama hoping for a new Business Proposal / What's wrong with Secretary Kim... Unfortunately something immediately rubbed me the wrong way. For a romcom I need to have believable actors for the male & female lead.  While the female leads are rarely the problem (they all look nice from my viewpoint as man) and again this one is looking quite nice.  However I have an issue with the male lead, on the poster he looks the standard Korean male lead. However I don't know how much photoshop they used but the second he landed with this parachute on the roof and I got a good look of his face I was disappointed. Am I really to believe that this guy is going to be the knight in shining armor for the girl???  He looks average at best. Especially for a romcom I'm gonna judge by beauty. If I as a man don't find the male lead believable as being able to attract a hot woman than I can't enjoy the series.  This guy is clearly NO Kim Ro-Woon or Kim Young-Kwan.  Dammit Netflix, why do you waste all those resources and don't cast an attractive male lead."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,1,,"I couldn't even get through the first episode!  It was silly, childish, boring, cliche, over the top, predictable, meaningless, etc etc.  The story is repetitive. I think I've seen the scenes one hundred times in other shows.  Same characters, same story line. Bad mean violent bosses, good hardworking employees, evil family member,.. in another word, everything you need to make a shallow boring and most importantly, not funny Disney cartoon.  The acting is also not good. It seems like the leads are actor wannabees and only get parts in projects because they have ""fan base"". It seems like number of fans is more important than actual talent in Korean entertainment industry.  All in all, don't waste your time."
킹더랜드,King the Land,2023,2,,"If a script is good, it may turn out to be a good movie, and it is also possible that the movie will be bad... But if the script is weak, it will definitely give a movie... In the movie, I saw very weak dialogues and a bad and very weak scenario, all these shortcomings. It was on the shoulders of the actors, but I think the stage designer did a good job... and the story was too long and the viewer got tired... and it was ridiculous when the Arab man came... and from there on, the story line got messed up and it's obvious What will be the consequences of the lack of story... Anyway, this movie is not recommended at all, it was extremely boring and pointless, don't waste your time."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"South Korea can make damn good zombie shows.  Overall, this was a fun, intense, and emotional watch. I binged it and couldn't stop, which I normally get bored of doing with most shows.  The characters were greatly developed and the story was compelling. You'll find yourself shocked with grief, laughing at well executed jokes, or intensely watching the screen wondering what will happen. Literally anyone can die in this, which adds to the anticipation. If you aren't into reading subtitles the English dubbing was also well done.  A couple quirks here and there, like the constant replaying of old scenes during ""aha"" or reminiscing moments. It's a bit overdone but not a problem really.  I don't want to give it a 10 because it's not like it's the best show ever made, but I would give it a 10/10 for entertainment alone. Definitely worth the watch."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"There is a lot to say about this zombie teenage drama.  The zombie portion is done very well, the only reason I bumped it up to 7 stars instead of 6 is how all of the constituent parts come together to create something greater than the sum of its parts, but this series is not without its flaws.  If you can appreciate good acting, a nice score, great cinematography, and a decent story (and love zombies) then this is for you.  However, if you're a logically minded person then this will be a trial of frustration in which characters will continually make the worst decisions possible.  Whatever you imagine you would do in the character's situation you can almost bet that they will go about things in the worst way imaginable. This is a compounding problem. There is no salvation from idiocy here, only bad decision after bad decision. This can be tolerated to an extent but the frustration only continues to rise.  Despite this glaring problem, everything else balances it out. It's worth watching if only because the dumb decisions benefit from the suspension of disbelief. You will find yourself rooting for the cast and get caught up in their emotional drama. You will find both high points and low points worth celebrating and mourning, all of the braindead decision-making be damned, you'll still be forced to feel something.  It's not the best zombie flick, but it's a damn good addition and a worthy addition to the Z-roster. Don't let this one escape you, just be prepared for the frustration that will inevitably rise."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,Koreans really know how to make a zombie flick!  Great character building and introduction of the different plotlines.  Two episodes in and it's mayhen and chaos all over the school!  As you go on more characters and different situations are presented and it all unfolds perfectly.  It is really well paced and non-stop action. A dramatic scene here and there but not too much to get you bored.  Freaky zombie outbreak like I've never seen before (only in Train to Busan).  I can't wait to see how it all plays out.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"When I heard of this Korean high school zombie series I was interested, despite the subject matter being done to death over the years. Then I saw the trailer and thought it looked amazing. Having just finished up the show, I can confirm that this is one of the most entertaining shows out there, and far surpasses the likes of THE WALKING DEAD. The small scale works a treat and somehow they manage to eke out the momentum over the whole 12-episode arc. It never feels too small and it never feels dull, packed as it is with expertly directed action and tense mayhem. The Koreans excel in this one and I loved every minute of it."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"I've read webtoon ""All of us are dead (Now at our school)"" right after watching the trailer of this show. It wasn't a lengthy comic with a heavy conversation, so it was easy to turn to the next chapters. I'm not a fan of the style of the comic, but it was still fun and intense. I'm in the 5th episode right now, and so far I've felt the show adapted the original webtoon quiet well which is why I wanted to write a review about it. However, I get to see these assumptions of promoting High school of the dead from the comments which is not okay seriously. I also watched High school of the Dead long time ago. All I can remember is that the anime was more about female body images rather than zombies and stuff. Plots and characters in both shows, there's no any similarity between the two. The only similar aspect is they both use high school students as main characters. Honestly, Is there anime that doesn't use high school students as main characters? Seriously, google High school of the dead anime, and watch it on youtube, you'll get the idea within 2 minutes. I would not recommend to watch it with female companions or friends though. Back to the show, All of us are dead, it's well made, and it adopted the original story very well.  Update: I ended up watching the whole series for 2 days. It's worth it just as other positive reviewers say. It's well paced, and mixed with good actions. Also it created a different type of zombie."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"The action of the zombies in this show is very realistic. It is interesting to watch the relationship between friends. Well executed until the middle of the series. From the ridiculous lines, to the moronic ""decisions"" to the horrible way they treated some characters. The typical Netflix-style ending was a bit disappointing, but I really enjoyed this show."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,6,,"There's a lot to unpack here, but the core problem is that there are maybe 6 great episodes worth of content in this 12 episode series.  When it gets it right, it gets it very right. Love, loss, longing, poignancy, savagery and pathos, it's all there. The writing, acting and production are strong enough to get you engaged, so as the cast get chowed on, you'll feel it.  However, it suffers from uneven tone, with too many cliched tropes and characters. Big-awkward guy, punky-girl, straight-laced nerd hottie, alpha and beta heroes, coward, and generic thug villain. You've seen them all before, many times.  Some scenes eschew peril for jarring slapstick, which breaks you right out of immersion. There's far, far too much shrieking, repetition, indecision, repetition, pointless sacrifice, and repetition.  Still, the effects, both practical, makeup and subtle CGI are top notch, the overall story arc is well conceived, and there are a few touching character developments.  It's not amazing, but it's solid, and it ends strongly and credibly without pushing the To Be Continued too hard. Just about worth your time."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"I am enjoying the show. I think Koreans know how to make a zombie movie or a show. I binge watched it entire Saturday and watched 9 episodes in a row. But since I need to sleep, I will watch the rest (3 episodes the next day, Sunday 30th Jan)"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,6,,"George Romero, the movie god who invented the modern zombie, always cast ordinary people as the characters in his films. He wanted zombies to represent us in a world of problems so relentless, so savage and so violent that they threaten to literally eat us alive. He wanted a world without death, with no end to our suffering, where we become the monsters when we die. He wanted the brutality to be banal, familiar and up close, where a world isn't saved by handsome Brad Pitt in three hours of pointless CGI.  Everyone has problems, and that is why every country has zombie movies. In Romero's US, the zombies represent a population so self absorbed that they have lost track of what is important to them. Both the surviving humans and the zombies themselves seek refuge in a shopping center because consumerism has replaced idealism in this country, In Venezuela, the zombies represent the rapid disintegration after the madman who ruled the country dies. The Venezuelans who try to escape are killed by their own friends and neighbors. In Africa, the zombies are what happens when nature takes the land back from the humans who are trying to change it. In the UK, zombies make England's island isolation into a prison where escape seems impossible.  You all know the movies. If you are reading this review, you like zombies.  In Korea, zombies are about young people. Train to Busan is the story of a young girl who survives, but to what end? #Alive is about a young gamer. The Wailing is about the disintegration of a village.  Korea is rapidly changing. It becomes more Westernized and industrial every day. The generation that lives through the Korean War is dying, and the ancient culture that sustained the country for centuries is being replaced by a First World country with cutting edge technology. However, Korea still sits between China and Japan, and the threat of annihilation from the crazy man in North Korea is ever present.  To that end, this series is both the same old zombie by virus plot, but embedded in the daily horror of high school everyone faces. The bullies are nearly as awful as the zombies, the principal is an idiot, the teachers are a mix of caring and stupid, and the pressure to succeed is painful.  Zombies invade a high school through the idiocy of a teacher. There are massive casualties as the kids fight for their lives, Only when it is obvious to everyone that all hope is lost does a teacher admit what has happened and tell the kids to leave. Then it is still every person trying to save himself. The virus that causes the zombie infection is stronger than human connection.  Young Koreans face a world in which, no matter how hard they work or how much they care, they are not safe from monsters. Teachers don't care if they are bullied. Friends turn against them. And, everyday, they face oblivion.  But they are teenagers, and they try.  Romero would like this series."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,5,,"...watching someone turn into a zombie before they take action? You take action before they get off the floor and try to bite you. It can be forgiven the first time (maybe even the second time), but every time? And it seems all the kids know zombie lore (one of them even mentions Train to Busan), yet don't act accordingly to defend themselves?  I've been watching a lot of Korean shows, and there's a trend where people don't do the right thing so they don't embarrass themselves or the job. And everyone always seems to be up for a job review, and it's better to let people die rather than speak up to avoid a negative review. Is it a narrative staple in Korea, or is that actually the culture (like the incessant crying in Korean tv and movies)?  I'll still watch the shows because they're still a hell of a lot better than the American crap."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,I can't begin to praise this superbly entertaining zombie thriller enough. The direction is superb clear even though lots is going on. Some of the scenes are truly memorable and epic. There is such a variety of scenarios and action sequences that it is exciting throughout. The stunt work is seamless so that it looks like the actors are doing them. Some epic scenes feel like a big budget movie.  The show doesn't fall short in the more intimate quiet scenes either. Characters both heroes and villains are involving and sympathetic and the relationships are interesting enough. The emotional scenes are good too - not overwrought but moving enough when a character you like gets bitten.  Cast members do a good job. The older cast has some familiar faces especially if you have seen the excellent but different pandemic show Happiness. The young cast isn't very famous and that's good since you don't associate them with other roles that much.  The 12 episodes just sped by. Of the recent worldwide topping Netflix shows I enjoyed this more than Hellbound and Squid Game.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,,,"All of us are dead is extremely graphic and disturbing than you may expect. Squeamish people... don't even try. People who want an edge-of-the-seat entertainment and can handle lavish gore... you guys are in for a ride.  Each episode delivers and even though they're a bit longer than usual, they don't feel tedious. When there's no mayhem, there are the character conflicts, thus making every episode as gripping as possible.  The characters are horror flick typical but they're smart and resourceful- okay maybe some foolish decisions here and there but hey they're still high school students! Seeing them come up with clever escape gimmicks is always the most fun part, as well as seeing them build trust between each other.  Cinematography is fine with some striking and ominous frame shots. Sound effects are impressive and detailed (with lots and lots of squelching lol). And the zombie transformation scenes - no matter how repetitive they get - always look pretty insane!  The cast are fantastic and everyone shines. I love that they're actually young actors cast as high schoolers (Hollywood take some notes!).  Overall, All of us are dead succeeds at being grim, comedic, and emotional all at the same time. Definitely a neat addition to the zombie/survival genre. Looks like another Netflix hit from South Korea.  8/10 worth the 12 hours.  TW: Bullying / Sexual harassment / Suicide."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"Happiness (2021) is also a Zombie Kdrama, except it's not. It focuses on the human aspect of survival in a way to try and present itself as unique. It tries to show us that humans are worse than zombies, except the writing is absolute garbage because the basis of each episode is a character making a dumb decision and then the two main protagonists having to fix that dumb decision. That is not how you create plot! That show falls into every zombie pitfall trope possible.  Now All os Us are dead on the other hand is amazing. If you want to see how cruel humans can actually be to one another, this is the show, especially after episode 3. Good cast of characters, great action, great plot, great sfx makeup and average cinematography. However if you're watching this show for film making techniques you've come to the wrong place."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"All of Us Are Dead is South Korea's latest entry into its esscalating body of undead mayhem (Train to Busan, #Alive, Happiness).  All of Us Are Dead pulls no punches and unleashes a savage and seemingly never-ending assault of fast-running zombies on an unfortunate squad of students who've managed to survive the first wave of a zombiecalypse. With 12 episodes running 1 hr long each, it gets a bit exhausting at times due to continuous gore and violence, yet it sticks to the basics and delivers a positive outcome, although there's nothing new.  All of Us Are Dead's zombie action is never not impressive. Whether it's giant chaotic crowd shots, massive ensemble brawls, or tricky ""oners,"" this is massively kinetic storytelling that will drain you as emotionally as it drains our heroes physically. Likewise, there are dozens of instances involving astounding body acting.  All of Us Are Dead may not offer up anything exactly new in the realm of zombie carnage other than its somewhat cruel and unrelenting nature, but sometimes that's enough to pull off some damn effective survival horror.  My Rating : 7.5/10."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"The serie is quite fun to watch but it doesn't bring anything new or special, unfortunately because sometimes these kind of movies from South Korean production companies can be a hidden gem (i.e. Train to Busan). However, it is really a South Korean zombie production so if you don't like that, don't bother to watch it. However, it doesn't meet the level of TWD but it definitely is much better than FTWD.  For those who love South Korean zombie production, All of Us are Dead is worth to watch. Sometimes it is a bit annoying and slow that you start to wonder whether you are watching a highschool serie. However, I binged it in a weekend and I kinda got into the main characters of the serie. I just hope that Netflix won't kill this serie and that it will order a 2nd season as the story got potential for another interesting zombie season."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,6,,Who greenlit this to be a 12 episode series? It's so dragged. No story just talking talking and more talking for 12+ hrs. It should have been just 6 or 8 episodes. Wasted potential.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,6,,"This show has decent characterization and the action is fairly interesting. It falls apart with the lapses in logic, though. Some characters do things that don't make a lot of sense, like taking unnecessary risks or not helping other characters they like. The show also excessively wastes time on characters who do nothing in the grand scheme of things. One person essentially took like 2 hours of screen time in the first season, opened a door for the main group, and then left. While that gives the feeling that any character could die, it also makes it seem like only the core characters actually matter and that everyone will just vanish or die from the show. Not to mention that there is a character who could easily deal with many of the issues the main group faces and... just doesn't? Maybe they explain at some point why this girl doesn't use her unique abilities more... but it seems like most problems are easily solved by getting that girl to go do things for the group. In conclusion, there are many logical issues that take away from the various problems they have to solve but the zombie stuff is still interesting for a zombie fan."

Most of characters are meant to be 16-17 but this is really an adult drama, when the students turn Zombie they bite out throats, take chunks out of people. Victims and Zombies alike jump and fall out of windows, frantic boys and girls barricade themselves in classrooms, battle against the Zombies. Fast moving action just like the Zombies who sprint about. Subplots about bullying and teen romance help the narrative along while the school principal wants to pretend everything is ok. A horror series which shocks but the terror is leavened by the teen love stories. The outbreak spreads. Zombie hordes charging at lines of riot police, even 3 deep they struggle to hold them back. Zombies munching on intestines. The dranas between the still human students becoming more intense. Refugees fleeing Hyosan are ""othered"", feared, even attacked. As so ften happens the authorities abandon the inhabitants of Hyosan while pretending to help them. It's an old trope but is given new life (or death) here due to the editing, acting and direction. How the Zombie virus was created is gradually revealed, it's root cause tied in with events which transpired at the school, you'll have to watch the series to put everything together, no spoilers here!

The virus spread all over the school and even the city.  It is too lengthy series with no story, it begins nicely then it is getting bored while you see, it should be in 8 episodes instead of 12 episodes and the episode run time should be 40 to 50 minutes instead of 60+ minutes.  The cast of the series is okay and the music is fine and the story also good but it should be not too lengthy and in this series they just talk and talk.

Probably the most infuriating show of this year so far. When I looked through this show, I was surprised that there's 12 episodes with 1 hour average runtime per episode. How can you make such a long show about zombies, one of the most saturated horror genres?  Just as my suspicion, the first 4 episodes were utter rubbish. It added nothing new, just the zombies pandemic breaking out. At this point I was thinking: let's rewatch Kingdom or Busan rather than this. The only thing kept me forward was the unique way of how the pandemic started.  Then episode 5 started, and the show picked up quickly with a new twist. It was very intense, chaotic, and unexpectedly funny. The characters were all hormonal kids, so they are bound to make stupid decisions amid a zombie attack. The twist was pretty good, and I think that it did enough to justify the existence of this show.  Character-wise, some were just straight-up wasteful. The two most notable were Na Yeon and On-Jo's dad. Some characters were incredibly infuriating like Nam-ra. The rest were pretty straightforward.  One thing that I have to point out. This show referenced Train to Busan, and made it clear that zombies movies exist in this universe. I think that it's supposed to be funny, but this really made the character decisions baffling. One kid pointed out this fact, but no one else seemed to be aware of this fact. The zombies acted pretty much exactly like in Busan and Peninsula. Couple of characters at one point killed zombies by stabbing the neck or head, but at another point had no clue how to kill a zombie. Like why don't they learn? It's an urgent situation, but they can't be that stupid.  Overall, this show is filled with problems, but it still added something new and made most of the runtime intense and fun. 6.5/10."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,5,,"Korean Industry has set high expectations about Zombie movies and dramas. So,if I compare this with these than this is nothing infront of those masterpieces. It is an avarage Zombie drama about how the school students survives from Zombie Apocalypse. I find the reflection of ''High School of dead '' anime somehow. It is because both occurred at school and they kind of have similarities too. However,I enjoyed it without thinking more. For me maybe, 5/6 episodes would be enough. It seemed to be dragged a lot. As there were no survival techniques were shown, all are about running or climbing the floors again and again. There weren't much character development and plenty of plot holes. Most funny thing is some zombies don't even die after killing multiple times. What they are trying to convey? They are immortal??  The ending is awful. I don't think there is any season needed, it was already dragged too much but they ended it this way."

One thing I like, and perhaps what may make this series different from other zombie series/movies, is that it tries to establish the similarities between domination of certain sections of people over the others in our society and dominant / invasive nature of parasites/viruses over other living organisms, irrespective of intelligence, consciousness or any other things.  Will have to see how the rest of the series turns out to be. Hope it turns out to be another critically acclaimed Korean series, among so many others."

Featuring storylines and premises done better in the movies and shows I have mentioned - like drama, romance and Zombies in a campus - the series is predictable and only adds one thing new: the ""Halfbies."""
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"This show has been pretty good thus far as I feel they have stepped it up a notch from the last Korean Zombie series called ""Kingdom"".  The special effects look more realistic of the blood spewin from the zombies necks compared to previous korean zombie series and movies also.  I dont like watching anything Korean but I do love their zombie stuff cause its always got superb acting. Out of all Asian zombie movies/shows i would say Koreans ranks the top as I have seen some very terrible ones from I believe Thai Or filipino and also Indian zombie series that were trash.  Western Zombie stuff is different then the Korean ones from the way they look too how they transform into zombies.  What western shows like The Walking Dead lacked was that it became to easy too kill zombies that their was no immediate danger. As well as the zombies all walk slow vs in the korean series they run and move fast and every encounter becomes a very close escape.  I seen some bad reviews on here but i feel these people are not giving it a fair judgement. Some complained about how its repetitive like other zombie shows but when u rate a show/movie u should be rating it for itself and not comparing it to other movies/shows.  Thats where Bias mindsets always kick in cause they always keep having expectations set already of comparing it to previous zombie shows or even worse is when people compare how an actor acts in other movies vs current ones.  So give this show a chance and dont rate it against other shows, thats not giving it a fair chance at all.  Just rate it as it is and how it is presented and you will find you will enjoy tv series n movies more then always having a closed mindset with full on expectations of how it shouldnt be or should be directed n written n acted."

Even though the story is nothing groundbreaking, it doesn't fail to deliver enjoyment to the viewers that seek for zombies and epic action.  My overall impression of the drama's story is not very great, not very bad either. It was a mediocre story and there were many unnecessary and illogical things for me to accept. Also, several same (or almost same) things and events happened which made the story repetitive and tedious at times. What I liked the most, was how it manages to show how differently everyone acts in order to survive or to save someone else.  Postive -  Entertainment  Emotions  Negative -  Plot Holes  Illogical Things."

지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"This is a decent zombie flick. High school students tried to survive a zombie outbreak at their school. Of course, it would not be a young adult flick without love stories, friendship stories, bromance and .... bullying. You would expect that, wouldn't you?!  One thing I would like to add for future zombie script writers. Zombie movies have been around since 1978, so the terms zombie outbreak and its symptoms are not an unknown thing to people nowadays. But every zombie movies always begin with an outbreak that looks like nobody know what it is or what to do. Please, next time write a zombie flick which the protagonists are aware of it and know what to do about it. It would be a refreshing story.  Worth watching 8/10."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,6,,"My expectation for the show was higher than what it turned out to be. The storyline was good, however, felt like it way too stretched that it should've been. The reason to create that virus that made the people zombie was that satisfactory. This shows the cruelty the victims face from the people they expect to aid them. The romance they tried to create in this show was not something appreciative at all. As the romance was not even a bit exciting all along the show. You can watch it if you have time it's a mid tier apocalyptic show.  The ending was a cliffhanger and it was a nice exciting one hopefully they can bring out the next season and make it a good one. However, my expectations are not that high as I don't think there can be something more added to make the story better."

I find it quite weird that there isn't a whole legion of people complaining and calling it woke. Guess they hid it well enough with splatter and gore.

There are some plot holes or things that didn't make sense but overall this is another Korean show that will go in my top 10 of awesome zombie shows/movies.  Cannot wait for season 2."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,A Korean high school is the epicentre for a virus which turns the students into flesh eating zombies. The story centres around a small group of students and their attempt to survive as they are continually hunted. It is well acted and it tells the stories of the good and bad pupils which the zombies do not differentiate from when they mindlessly attack. It has plenty of individual introspection as friends and family fall victim and although not the best storyline each episode does enough to hold your interest for the whole series to discover the outcome.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,I do love watching anything Korean and zombies thrown into the mix was a bonus I really enjoyed it was was glued to the TV all day. Ignore the negative comments and give it a try and then decide for yourself. 😉😊
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,6,,"The acting is convincing, but in stark contrast with the unrealistic emotions that the plot requires.  When your best friend clearly becomes a zombie, you hug them; when a bunch of zombies run towards you, you freeze for 10 seconds before reacting; when there's a clear path to safety, you consider staying behind because supposedly ""everyone"" you love is dead, everyone being just your crush and your best friend and not your very much alive parents.  Since that's the kind of scenes that these actors have to enact, the actual storyline hardly matters. Even if you are able to ignore those nonsensical lines and scenes, you still won't see much depth in the story. In place of tough moral decisions, this apocalyptic story chooses to focus on bullying and petty bickering.  This series is strictly for people with a lot of time to kill."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,4,,"I enjoy K-Drama with Train to Busan going down as a top 5 zombie movie of all time. In it, you saw the motivations for why people acted the way that they did.  In this series, I think the mistake was having 12 episodes, meaning they had to stretch out the story using manufactured drama, lots of it, in every single show. There was no reasoning or explanation on people's actions and reactions(Episode 3 will make you toss something at your TV). Also, having a very weak protagonist who causes the death of other people is never a good idea. This series is more closely related to dreadful Army of Dead than Train to Busan. Most of the decisions are just plot devices for failure. At one point you stop caring who lives or who dies.  The people who like this will be the same people that say Real Housewives is good reality TV or really liked Twilight. The rest of us is a no."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"Only 4 episodes in, its very dramatic but fun moments and zombie attacks everywhere, gonna keep continue watching this, any zombie lover and korean series watchers would love this one."

I really enjoyed this series, binged with my wife. If ur looking for a good zombie horror action with some kdrama and kquirks this is really good, just note the 1st episode sets up the show so it's abit slow."

Highly recommended for both who likes the zombie genre and those who doesn't like it.  This isn't your usual, ordinary, zombie show. It's full of character development, real life and realistic drama, and lessons in survival and life itself."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"This show is so different from every other zombies movie or series, It's very interesting how the virus works which we find out later, the virus was supposed to help the weak, it's not just that but I won't say too much but it's so interesting and it's not some stupid action movie, and it breaks a lot of stereotypes of tv series, and the best thing is the characters know how zombies work, it's so meta. It's rlly good."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"This is what good television is but you should absolutely NOT compare it to other zombie series'. Anyway! Korean zombies are far more terrifying in their look than western TV and film zombies!  The Zombies are just as terrifying as the ones in the other South Korean Zombie series'; like the excellent ""KINGDOM"" or the brilliant South Korean film ""RAMPAGE""! I love it and its good fun watchable television; better than any reality series trash!  The only time that the series is/was calm and plodding along was in the first episode - before anyone turned Zombie - but after that it was a case of Shock, jump out of skin and a continuous Holy Crap viewing time :) Its come along just in time seeing that ""The WALKING DEAD"" will be no more each week...it had a good run though and was highly enjoyable viewing.  Don't sit next to your girlfriend, sister or wife when watching this; unless you are wearing some kind of, good thick anti nails digging into your arm, protection! You will then be safe to watch some great acting and a lot of scary scenes!"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"Genre is not new but feels refreshing.   Acting is decently good, except for some, unknown whether due to role or actor. Dialog is in Korean so let's leave that to the Korean speakers to decide if it's natural or not.   Zombie fighting scenes are well-choreographed, entertaining and brutal but not gratuitously gory, the most fun part of the series. Main antagonist was given too little screen time (fighting scenes against villain too short, often ends abruptly).           ---All in all: worth a watch---"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,5,,"It actually started off great. Interesting characters, very creative cinematography, and great acting. But as the show went on, it got dumber and dumber with plot holes, bad writing, inconsistencies and things that just don't make sense. I was hoping this would be a Korean 'series', along the likes of Kingdom, Extracurricular, Stranger, Squid Game to name a few. But instead it's just a 'K-drama' with zombies. To give credit where credit is due; the acting for the most part is excellent. The cinematography (at least in the earlier episodes) is very creative, especially the one take sequence in episode 2. The stunts by everyone (especially the zombie actors) is incredible and the action choreography is excellent. Just wish it was written and directed better."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"Yes -- I see you.  This series was awesome.  One of the better zombie movies for sure. It's not one of those blunt zombie movies where people get eaten alive. The movie touches upon real societal issues, youth violence & crime, and class division. There are only handful of zombie outbreak movies out there that can even compare.  Ugh so much blind hate."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"This show had me from the very first frame, the cinematography is what drew me in first, then the story and the actors all are excellent in their roles. There is so much going on in each episode and each episode is an hour or so Long. I'm on episode 7 and can't wait for my boyfriend to get off of work so we can watch the rest Tonight. This is a crazy good show."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,6,,"Too excited for this show and maybe that was why I was disappointed. Non stop watched to ep. 3 trying to get into the storyline and characters, and although it gets better after each episodes, both storyline and characters so far are unremarkable. Too many holes in the plot, timeline all wrong.. Some of the main characters are so annoying that I rooted for the zombies.  Nevertheless, the zombies are great and it is definitely entertaining so I would grudgingly finish watching this."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"First of all, when zombie attacks started, I thought same thing like other comments ;'welcome to train to Busan', till now it ok for me I am on second episode. A little slow and too long but still ok. Some scenes are really good as a cinematography, Korean people knows how to make tension.  I will not say this is a disturbing zombie series."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"Solid zombie high school K-drama. Beautiful and memorable precious things about High schools and friends are shown inside this show. Suspenseful, heartbreaking and very interesting! Legit acting. This tv series deserves recognition. Overall, very promising and recommend to watch."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"3 episodes in, I have to say I'm enjoying it.  Yes it's not perfect at all; whenever someone is transforming in a zombie, people just stare and stay still. While there's enough time to take action like throw him/her out of a window or bash its skull. Rather than doing that they just watch and start running when the zombie has fully transformed. I could understand that the first time. But after the same person has seen more than 10 zombie 'transformations', and still does not take action and is surprised the zombie then launches at them, you start to wonder how stupid they actually are... CGI doesn't look to good when there is action involved like a zombie launching itself at someone.   Saying that, I have to admit really enjoying this show. It's well acted, well written, sometimes even original and overall it's just tons of fun.  A solid 7 for me."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"After squid game, Korea did they it again! Don't watch the trailer, it will spoil so much. This one is highly recommended, it's wild, entertaining and engaging. There is no nudity,sex and this show feels so real. It's super awesome starting from the 3rd episode. Also a cliffhanger at the end of every episode. Ending is satisfactory. Hoping for the 2nd season."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"✅ Easy plot but the storyline compensates it as a whole ✅ Gore effects ✅ Lead roles (males) and the class president's acting ✅ Properly executed but its very predictable twists and cliché ✅ Mind blowing scientific explanation on how it (zombies) started  ❌ Character build up ❌ Slow start ❌ Some loopholes like people are aware that they are zombies but they don't know how to kill them and etcetera ❌ Female lead roles' action skills ❌ Ending can be a lot better (I think); a different cliff hanger, maybe. Why would they go back to the same place where they barely survived even if its for a good purpose?  ❌❌❌ Because of plot armor It could've been 8, however, I find some unnecessary conversations which doesn't add up to the storyline. Its just there to make the episode longer. 😅  Add ons:"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,2,,I really wanted to like this series. Interesting start. Lovable and hateable characters. Wayyyyyyyy overdrawn and annoying at times. They jumped the shark so many times.  The plot holes are cavernous.  It's so cheesy it's disgusting.  It's pretty much anime in live action. Not in a good way.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"Holy WOW! This show blew me away by excellent production quality especially the zombies, amazing young talented actors, and excellent storyline with depth not just senseless zombie flick.  Honestly I never thought that after Walking Dead's massive let down I would ever enjoy a Zombie flick but this show just took it to whole new level. It had everything you need, a great storyline from start to finish, excellent mind boggling graphics, excellent cast, emotion, gore, cringe, and edge of your seat scenes, adrenaline and more.  Wow. Hollywood needs to wake up and take lessons from Korean shows! They are just on another level! I really hope there's a Season 2 for this show. I am totally hooked!"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"First, I highly recommend watching with original audio and subtitles. The dub version voice acting is just not engaging enough.  This classic zombie plot series stands out by deeply portraying a variety of characters who don't typically frustrate the viewer by making poor decisions. You begin to connect with the characters and empathize with their decisions. Don't get too cozy with them as the series takes a GOT ""no character is safe"" approach.  From start to finish each zombie encounter felt real. Nothing seemed too absurd including the various emotional impacts of certain decisions.  Excellent series with minimal areas for improvement!"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"The first episodes of this series are wonderful, turning the Hollywood cliché of ill-mannered teens fighting zombies into an almost cartoonish depiction of zombie invasions. Fun. The action is well filmed, the acting adequate and the pacing for the first seven episodes tight and disciplined.  Of course, the show is not without major faults, the biggest being characters just standing there as zombies attack, reacting only at the last second. I laughed every time because it plays into the MacGruber joke and does it too many times.  Too bad ep 8 is so boring, The series tries to get back on track but loses its way with too much repetition (a sense of deju vu abounds throughout as the series progresses)."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"Is this a great zombie outbreak show? Yes. Is it plauged by the occasional cheesy comic relief cliches at points? Also Yes. But this show goes so much further than that. In the end it's less about the zombies and more about the horrific trauma the outbreak inflicts on everyone involved. It shows the perspective of survivors as well as rescuers and military. No one is spared from the effects of this nightmare and nothing is black and white. It's honestly tough to watch at times and nauseating to see what these people have to go through, but it's refreshing in the sense that it isn't just a mindless hack and slash zombie flick and actually deals with tragedy as well as moral and ethical dilemmas. Highly Recommend."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"If you're looking for some 'Train to Busan' kind of horror or action, then walk away because the movie isn't for you.  Not every zombie movie or show has to have the same storyline; it can either be funny like ""Zombieland,"" serious like ''World War Z' or be in the form of a TV series like ""The Walking Dead.""  It depends on your preferences. Speaking of ""All of Us are Dead,"" it's a decent watch if you're into survival genre and you have nothing else to watch at the moment.  In addition to that, 1. It's based on a popular webtoon 2. The effects are good 3. It's only 12 episodes, unlike some TV series with 16 plus."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,The first episode was difficult to watch due to bullying and sexual assault. To begin with the story draws you in and you want the characters to be able survive the zombies apocalypse.  As the story continued the characters stories are all intertwined from a horrific event. The overall question became will theses characters be able to survive each other and zombies.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,6,,"The character is not special enough to like.   -For me, the atmosphere in the movie is not attractive, maybe the length is too long.  -There are a lot of scenes that are a bit awkward.  -There are a lot of boring dialogues.  Old content but not more advanced.   -Quite long for entertainment.  *Other than that, the action scenes are fine."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,I loved the show for its suspense and great special events it never got boring up until the end where I got a bit annoyed due to the lack of action but other than that one little bit it was an incredible show.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,6,,"I looked forward to this kdrama and the trailer was quite good as well. So, I had expectations for it. I even completed reading the Web toon to get ready for the watch.  But, it was kind of disappointing. I directly compared this drama to ""Happiness"", which is another Zombie centric drama that was aired just mere months ago. While ""Happiness"" had a lot of things right and had found a right balance between the Zombie action and human interactions, ""All of Us Are Dead"" was just mindless actions in most of the episodes. Sometimes quite repetitive to the point that we can easily predict the outcome.  I liked the four leads, but other than the characters of Lee Cheongsan and Nam Ohjo which were built well, Lee Suhyeok and Choi Namra's characters could have given much depth. Especially Namra's who had the most interesting character arc. But hers was not explored till the last episode.  Likewise there were so many things that fell short of expectations. Including the final explanation that the Webtoon carried. Anyhow, the drama is still enjoyable and the action is good. The settings and choreography are well done as well.  Good effort. But overall, the drama is just okay."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"I haven't had one of those ""just one more"" until 3am tv shows in a while.  It's so well done, you feel like you speak Korean -it flows seamlessly. Moments of laughter, moments of bawling. It was just great.  Nothing scares me more than running zombies. Refreshing take on a virus, just great.  One downer was sometimes it was a bit slow. Otherwise fantastic."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"Perfect? No, but def worth a watch, kinda addfictive.  Zombies are very cool and scary, feel like Train to Busan zombies. I really don't understand why some people complain about them.  Characters: they are many of them, some are more likable than others. What is nice is we never know who will die or not ; sometime a character got a big story but then die right after, sometime a ''secondary'' character (at first) will become important. So it's stressful when they are under attack, because we really don't know who will survive. Yea sometime they die in some weird/dumb way, but it would happen in a real zombie invasion. It's not alway super cool and heroic in my opinion.  I don't agree when people complain that some characters just stand here and don't move. It's possible to be shocked when your best friend or dad or mom turn into a zombie. Not sure if you would do better, really.  Perhap a bit too much teen drama for my taste, I was a bit annoyed at episode 7-8-9, but it's ok. I kind of agree that the serie could have been like 10 epiodes instead of 12.  Not a fan of the pseudo intellectual jaded ideas of ''humanity is evil, bad so they deserve it'' and stuff.  A good 8/10 for sure, try it."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"All of Us Are Dead doesn't disappoint if you (like me) like a zombie film/series. There's plenty of zombie action and lots of gore, it's a fun show.  Just don't expect too much from it, it's a zombie series after all, it's not meant to be taken that seriously. I found it to be an entertaining watch - good cinematography, effects, acting and direction.  It has its flaws, the biggest one for me being that there isn't really much of a narrative there, it's just a lot of ""oh no, there are zombies trying to get us, we must escape"" kind of thing, but I still liked it for what it was.  If you like the genre then you'll probably enjoy it, if not, don't watch it."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"This Korean serial surprised me a lot, through 12 episodes there was a lot of action and it was actually realistic then it could be. Seeing group of friends making decisions was interesting but in middle I kinda started being like what's going on. But when it was almost over of episodes the drama and decisions and things they had to do just survive or save theirs so called friends was something really good to see and it was probably 1st Korean serial that I've actually liked this much and watched it all day long, always thinking what they will do or what would happen even though some parts were predictable but still enjoyed this movie."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"This series has it all: Action Gore Surprise The unexpected and addressing the mundane questions we often mutter, but are not normally addressed - i.e. 'how do we go to the bathroom?'   I really enjoyed this series. Each episode is quite long but giving enough time to learn about each character and the situation they are in.  Just as you think you have guessed what will happen a curve ball is thrown and it takes a different route to the one you were expecting. In summary this is a series about zombie survival - a story which is way over played - but there is something about the series which tackles the subject in a different way.  Characters are killed off you wouldn't expect to be killed off... gore happens when you don't expect it to happen... and the overall surprise of it all makes 'All of Us Are Dead' compelling viewing.  If you enjoy zombie survival films then give this a try. 8 out of 10!"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"We have had a bonanza of gory zombie movies and series, not to mention the entire Walking Dead saga and its numerous spin-offs. But I must say the Koreans have risen to the occasion, and are now outputting world-class material that provides a formidable challenge to Hollywood, and any other nation.  At the heart of this gripping series is the journey of a small group of friends, torn apart by sacrifice and cruelty, kindness and savagery, but all the while growing closer together. Watching their very real pain when their friends die is truly terrible. This series manages to generate tension at times when you forget your surroundings and are yelling into the screen. And just like any other zombie genre, painful unexpected deaths get you when you least expect them.  The series knows how to play with your emotions, making you cringe when sacrifices are made for seemingly senseless reasons, and when redemption is missed by mere seconds. There are plenty of twists and turns - no one is safe. The interesting idea of an internal struggle between human and zombie is also a new idea altogether."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,6,,"Watching ""All of Us Are Dead"" is like watching someone else play a zombie video game, but the player controlling these characters makes them act, for lack of a more ridiculous term, ""silly"". Plainly, the characters go through woefully contrived motions for the sake of forced tension. By the fourth or fifth episode, I found it easy to root for the zombies, at least some of them had brains. Low hanging fruit, you know how I feel about zombie content. I finished the season because I had to."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"What can I say about this show that hasn't already been said? Well, let me just start off by saying that all the 1 star and 10 star reviews are wrong. This show has some flaws, but absolutely not enough flaws that would make it unwatchable.  'All of us are dead' has this unique blend of comedic high school zombie action that, although used before, has not been achieved at this level of live-action television before. During the first episodes of my viewing, I definitely felt the typical ""how can they stretch this out to 12 episodes"", just to be proved absolutely wrong! The first episode is by far the worst, and with this usually being a red flag, it definitely is not here. 'All of us are dead' consumes the viewer, and already by episode 3 you will find yourself deeply attached to these characters, hoping none of them will die (except the bully) only to know that is not true.  I believe the biggest strength to this show, is this attachment you will have towards these characters. With a massive cast of high school personalities, nearly all of them have a reason to cheer on their survival.  'All of us are dead' often follows some typical tropes of zombie tv, but is filled with enough action and dialogue to make this feel fresh in its own way.  If you can ignore some of the rare negative character actions, the not fully fledge out description of how the virus works, and the few repetitive scenes (such as the bully always reappearing again), then this show is a MUST WATCH for any zombie-lover.  A complaint by reviewers which I found absolutely unnecessary was that some were shocked when certain characters died. One of the best things to come out of television in the past decade, was the unknownness of death brought on by shows such as 'Game of Thrones'. If you can't work past this inevitability of death, especially in a ZOMBIE show where one bite is the end, then why would you even start a show like this in the first place?  Although I was not expecting or hoping there would be a season 2, the cliffhanger at the end makes me fairly certain there will be, and I am ok with that as long as it sustains some originality.  Overall, by weighing all the negative and positives this show still maintains a solid 8 out of 10, but due to typical K-drama bashing, fake reviews, and hate due to unexpectedness, I will give this a 9/10!  I am already wishing to re-watch it with a friend, just to see how and who they will form attachments too, as character attachment is needed for success!  Thank you for this wonderful wonderful show, this was definitely a great way to start off 2022!"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,I would rate this close to TWD in writing and special effects - the story came up a little short and the Direction was a little slow at times but on balance a surprise to be sure. It took a couple of episodes to get into the characters but the inter stories were compelling - the show runner my have made a mistake in killing off too many of the characters but the primary ones survived and might give Netflix enough to go with another season - the ending was intriguing and left the door open for a second season with a whole new direction - I will watch it if it does and recommend it for those that are into Zombie movies - my wife isn't but she has other really good qualities.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"The first couple of episodes was a bust, i was on the verge of quitting it but I decided to continue and I am glad I did. The reason as a lot of people said before me was the emotions in the first couple of episodes lacked, however further on their emotions do come out. Had some funny parts as well as sad parts. I enjoyed it so watch all the episodes before you rate it because it does get better."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"This show is absolutely one of the most craziest experiences I've had in a long while. From the get go there has not been a dull moment. Characters are introduced through exciting events which helps keep the viewers engaged. The encounters and instant interactions between the protagonist feel real as it would in an actual event. Even the decisions and behaviour traits portrayed by each character are fantastic and show in-depth character progression. Certain plot results may have not thrilled the fans as the build up for characters wouldn't always do them justice in the end, but I guess that's just how realistically the writers wanted to make the show appear. Overall, fantastic show!"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"I thought the cast worked hard and well. But I also thought this series could have been limited to about 8 eps at the most. For me there was too much repetition of Zombie tropes and cliches in the storyline as well as from the genre itself, and slow pace-often dragging itself along. Frankly, I got tired of the Zombies and am probably tired of the whole genre. That said, I really did like the cast, who made me care about them, which kept me watching. But still, the plot itself is predictable and underwhelming except for a few threads that touch the heart. It is okay, but no Train to Busan, Sweet Home, or Kingdom."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"Really well-put together show.  EXCELLENT VILLAIN and creative conflict.  There are so many aspects to the conflict: bullying, killing, betrayal, friendship, survival, they literally thought of everything.  The main story-line of the primary group of classmates was incredibly thrilling, but the side stories were just as good.  We not only get multiple perspectives of the apocalypse, so that the whole show isn't just stuck inside of a school builing.  I was so STRESSED watching this show though, mostly the second half. Some of the bad decision-making drove me up the wall, but the characters are so well-developed that I understood why they made their decisions."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,6,,Good story but they don't rally dragged it out. Chronic overuse of the people running and falling. I don't think Koreans are as inept at running as they portray. My gosh not one person could run without stumbling.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"Despite all the horror, violence, blood and human entrails typical of zombie movies this story is really beautiful.  True love and sacrifice, real friendship and team work and hope till the end. Characters both heroes and villains are very original, not super humans, super strong, super smart or super evil and emotionally unstable, nothing is exaggerated (which cannot be said about most of the recent productions where we simply see freaks, even protagonists). Compered to adults depicted in this story teenagers look more human in face of danger and despair and their strenght is not in their brains or muscles but in their hearts. Simple story and simple message nothing new but well told.  Young Korean actors done really well. On-jo her character show us how delicate and infantile, maybe even weak person could be really strong and pure in the same time. The child and the adult in one person - teenager. All the rest are brilliant and original either.  10/10 because this story is entertaining and smart, scary and touching, funny and sad, simple and yet deep and complex in the same time.  In between high masterpiece and really bad movies lays the real cinema."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"The puns always fly high with the zombie genre with films and adaptions been done to the death you could say but it just never stays dead. Added to the catalogue of zombie stories is this Korean Netflix series which has been a pleasant surprise. I've become quite bored of zombie movies but this series has really revitalised the genre.  I've never watched the Walking Dead or seen some of the other recent films, but like many have been a huge admirer of the original Night of the Living Dead which was seminal. This series in many ways harks back more to that film than other adaptions as its more about the people than the gore. The real horror is possibly those you're holed up with.  What we have is a virus outbreak at a school decimating first the school and then the local Korean City, with a bunch of students holed up trying to survive. As expected there's teenage pains but it's handled tenderly and there is a well scripted handling of the trauma in surviving this catastrophe. Add in the usual mix of politicians, family issues, God fearing heroic cops, the school bully villain and so on and you have the ensemble.  The difference here is that given a series it allows for greater depth to the characterisations. You begin to empathise with some deeply whichyis quite brilliant. Much credit also for keeping plot armour to a bare minimum which is a relief, no one is safe.  The CGI is great but really it's the actual acting by the youth that keeps you most interested. The pacing is good and there are plenty of surprises along the way. It also balances violence, humour and emotion without going too far.  If there are issues then maybe we've seen much of it before but that shouldn't distract from this fine effort. One or two twists also were stretching things but it is a zombie horror show!  It's worth a watch. I guess they may make a sequel series but really I hope not. This is fine closing as it did. Enjoy."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,4,,"Korean shows tend to be really hit or miss for me. Sweet Home, My Name, and Squid Game are all great shows with well-developed characters who act in a believable way given their situations. This show is definitely a miss for me though. The writing seems to focus only on making things dramatic; characters do terrible and dumb things for no discernible reason, since in many cases they haven't been developed enough. The kid on the roof who we barely know screws everyone over because... reasons? The Military commander is ruthlessly evil in some scenes and then in other scenes tries to take the high ground and and lament what they have to do, and it just doesn't feel coherent. The writers also forgot that humans need water to survive, even though one of the students says in one of the earlier episodes that they are already dehydrated. It even starts raining at one point and NOT ONE PERSON thinks to get a bucket or something and collect some drinking water. The EMS father finds a stockpile of guns and only brings one because ...? And then he gives his only gun away before he even gets to the school? Soooo much stupidity in this show. I could go on and on but you get the point. If all you want is drama and you don't care about character decisions making sense, then by all means give this show a go. But if you are the type who gets annoyed when characters behave in dumb or unbelievable ways, stay far, farrr away."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"I'm halfway through the series ""All of Us Are Dead"" and say it's a win for zombie aficionados everywhere. Like most flicks of its kind it makes you wonder, was humanity already brain dead well before the apocalypse hit?  There's a nice subtheme going on related to exam hell and the fact that students in Korea come out of 12 years of education with virtually no skills beyond those required for test-taking and punching fingers at SmartPhones.  When watching this I can't help think of the Sewol Ferry and how a paucity of critical thinking skills was at least a contributing factor to that completely avoidable tragedy. I have a feeling it was very much in the minds of the creators as well.  I have a personal connection with Andong, where much of the movie was filmed, having spent 7 years teaching at the national university there. As a side note, on several occasions I tried to get my students on-board terrorizing the community with a zombie night in lieu of something called English Education night, a series of demanding performances which everybody seemed to loathe. This was way before zombie mania hit Korea in the form of ""Train to Busan"" and, now, ""All of Us Are Dead."""
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,I don't care about what people say bad about this series . I swear this was the best zombie series ever with hints of romance thriller drama and suspense . I really recommend watching this .  I love the way namra catch out nayeon plan not gonna spoiler it . I loved every second of this series.  No matter how much you re watch it you will never get sick of this show.  All of us are dead had great acting and the series didn't have fake/unrealistic scenes or acting. The actors did a very good job. So we'll done to the cast . This movies really targets zombie lovers and k drama lovers like myself.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"I liked the slow pacing here. Yeah some might get annoyed with this but overall the series was decent. Some scenes are pretty brutal, they didn't hold back. There are some moves and consequences which annoyed me very. Some deaths and also few others things. Yeah it is fiction, but some parts were completely missing. But a potential season 2 has the chance to be much better."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,Really decent at first when I saw it on the netflix programmes you might like i though it looks two bob but put it on for background and couldn't take my eyes off it the further in you watch the better it gets. Pure action no pc cr*b just non stop. Wish the west made zombies like this.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"All of us are dead is show following zombie apocalypse story resembling with Train to Busan, well containing lots of references. Story is simple virus outbreak in school and some students fights to survive in this situation. Basically this type of show should attach peoples emotion with survivors but its lack because of less character building. You will definitely feel at the time when episode are streching like it don't have much to do with story progress. Lots of scene where body parts are all over the floor and its just feels disgusting. Yes, but at the end it revived itself in last two episodes. Feeling of curiosity to watch more grows. Not sure to watch Season 2."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,One of the best Zombie series I have seen.. I don't know why some give negative reviews.. Seriously what you guyzz expect in zombie series???emotional scenes are good.. Zombie scenes nice... I could rate 10/10.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"This is the type of show you put on when there's nothing else to watch, or if you don't want something too complicated. Some really great acting in this one, I even found myself getting annoyed by some of the characters. Amazing CGI and special effects, definitely feels like it had a big budget. There were some plot holes of course, and some things were just left unexplained until the end but it doesn't really affect the viewing experience."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"Very, very interesting, especially the last episodes of the series. The element of surprise is present in a way that makes the viewer stunned. Advice that is not related to any character."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"The first two and last two episodes are great. The production quality is as high as any other work. The zombies are very believable. The pacing in the first few episodes is phenomenal. We meet the characters being their world is thrown into chaos.  Unfortunately after that the series gets a little repetitive and boring. They throw the same zombie off a roof two or three times. They gather together to make a decision together several times. They end up going back to this room, etc. In some of these moments I also thought characters behaved inconsistently.  I also thought the human-zombie hybrids were not a great idea. The zombies and evil humans are enough! No need for extra non-sense.  I think 13 episodes might have been too much for the script. But overall, the series was entertaining and worth a watch."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,5,,"I am a fan of zombies and Korean movie industry has built some good reputation in this matter. BUT this series may have pulled down the reputation because this series is so bad such that I wonder if it was directed by teenagers.  Bad acting!  Good thing is that the mystery got explained very soon in the second episode (if you can go that far).  Those creepy/zombie scenes are totally predictable and common in a zombie-themed series/move so they can't be constituted as a reason to give applause to this series.  Too many scenes are not logical at all. For instance when Onju was pressed against the floor by a infected male student, what should be expected is she simply can be bitten. But no, apparently she holds the fight and get away with the zombie. But wait! One second ago she is too terrified to move and next second she fights back the zombie.  And the extinguisher can also defeat zombies?  It just a tip of iceberg showing how bad this series."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"Despite some flaws, this show is a pretty good zombie series and I was rather surprised at how binge-able this was.  It did a very decent job of presenting gore, mystery, thrill, drama and--of course--romance. The overall effect of the plot is captivating that you find yourself drawn in. The makeup on the zombies is extremely disgusting, which superbly serves its purpose. The mystery and thrill of the story does a good job to keep you glued to the screen, wanting to know what happens next. Although a lot of characters remain flat, I'm glad they aren't all so one-sided.  My biggest gripes of this series are 1) how quickly they get rid of characters without giving them a chance to really make an impact or finish their stories 2) the frustrating decisions some characters make leading to dumb consequences (seems like a theme for a lot of horror/thriller movies, which could be fixed). 3) The color of blood on the costumes at times feel a bit too pink, but that's coming from someone who works in film. 4) The CGI feels very unrealistic at times, which takes you out of the film. If these elements were done better, I think I would have enjoyed this a lot more.  If you're into zombie shows, this deserves a shot. It has a lot of gore, endless action sequences, mixed with different character relationships and thrilling nailbiting moments."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,I only watched 2 episode right now ...guys its awsome its not serious like TWD.but its not funny as ZOMBOAT...trust me you will like it even you are not ZOMBIE fan .....

지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"...not so much at closing them.  Men... I can't tell you how many times I got mad at them. I feel like I finally understood my mom when she screamed, 'Close the door!'  Thanks, Mom, for a valuable post-apocalypse lesson. I wish they had a mom like mine.  Good show, by the way.  But... the NOT closing doors... Jesus... I mean... your life depends on it, you know?  Maybe none of them had one growing up?  Or maybe they all had self-closing doors at home.  I mean... I knew doors were a good thing before this show, but I've reached a whole new level of appreciation for them after this.  I hope this review helps you remember to close doors every time from now on, so you get used to doing it, and when the time comes, you will be safe."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"I've watched a lot of zombie movies and TV over the years, and I thought All of Us Are Dead was among the best. The action was often incredibly exciting and tense, and the high school students' developing relationships seemed emotionally believable to me. (I mostly watched in Korean with English subs - the English dubbing struck me as weak, causing many dialogue exchanges to sound stilted and overacted.)  Also, even when I like an action show where a group of characters is in constant danger, I usually think repeatedly, ""You're such an idiot, you deserve to be killed."" But I can't remember thinking that here. Sometimes the characters make mistakes, but, to me at least, they're realistic mistakes that might actually happen in stressful moments.  Anyway, it's the rare new series like this one that keeps me from cancelling Netflix."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"This series isn't bad. It's just a bit frustrating at times. The action and gore is pretty good, and the acting is also good, especially from the zombies. Who are all so realistic and played superbly. My biggest issue is the STUPID decisions that the characters were making. I don't think I've ever shouted at the tv so much in my life. A fun and entertaining watch, if you don't mind not taking it too seriously."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"Absolutely. Totally unexpected, but such charismatic characters played with finesse in a story line I never expected would hold my interest. Every once in awhile, Korea presents an amazing series with fascinating characters masterfully portrayed. This was a beautiful series with a background of enigma and moral ambiguity."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"It's a good show! You can have a bit of everything in it and all is handled really well. I'm a bit disappointed about the last 2 episodes, but for sure i'll check for the next season. I also love the references to the classic 'train of Busan'.  The stories of students are really involving, you can have romance and family stories in a pure zombie drama. Actors' performance are quite acceptable, even if not all the young actors are really good in acting. I hope second season will bring the same quality and a new good plot! I'm also curious to see if we will see back certain characters. I enjoyed the whole drama."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,2,,"Not sure what to make about the people giving this rave reviews. My guess is they're really young or just paid accounts. This series was very disappointing (as usual with Netflix). Poorly written, acted and execution. If you're looking for the next Squid Game this ain't it. Not by a wide mile. Trust me on this, skip this low budget trash."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"Just finished watching this series and wow.  I love Korean products that talk about zombies, this amazed me, it was a mix of emotions. I laughed, cried, screamed, felt sorry for the characters, got upset about some adult choices, and empathized totally with them.  I find it a fantastic product, the relationships between people and the reactions they have really amazed me.  I hope a sequel comes out, I want to see them again."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"Darn this was so amazing It was so thrilling!! Ofc it's the same old plot about zombies attacking people and biting but what makes its really good is legit EVERYTHING - Like the character interaction, what all they did for survival and how they saved themselves. The series had people betraying others which made me really mad and frustrated. But it also had amazing characters who sacrificed themselves. The entire acting is amazing and i never got bored. I've been super hyped about it ever since the trailer came and after watching it didn't dissapoint me!! It made me feel soo conflicted and so sad. Really good and worth the hype."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"Having enjoyed Squid Game, thought I would give this a go, the first scene was very violent but captivating all the same, as the storyline became clearer it became addictive viewing. Only watched 3 episodes but really enjoying this South Korean horror fest. Enjoy."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"I enjoy the zombie premise but the characters talk way too much. One group literally spends entire episodes talking and not utilizing their surroundings for survival.  A lot of high school drama. But mixed in with a lot of terrible adult storyline and acting. The show lacks focus.  Coming off of the walking dead series, this show really focuses on running and not fighting. The constant running and bickering can get tiring."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,It is a good web series and its story is also very nice. The way it is directed is also very good and I want to watch its season 2 And i am requesting watch this series once you will also be a fan of it.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"Koreans have been making some pretty decent stuff lately, biggest example squid games. Last few years they been making some great stuff. This year they already came out with 2 different shows including this one im writting about. This was pretty well done, had some flaws with it that is considered tv show mistakes. Had lots of things I remember thinking why can't he do it but she can? So some flaws they did not see but other then that had decent story pretty good characters not huge development on them but still had some, id consider this show more action but was still really good and always kept my attention. Im really bad at reviews and writting in general so I hope people really looking for an awnser can understand what I was trying to say ( if not clear)"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"Great kdrama, it was nerve-wrecking, horryfying. Love the fact that no character presented as perfect and the storyline reflects many societal problems that we know but usually ignore.  Overall, I recommend to watch!"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,5,,"I started this show with very high hopes, as it's first episodes shown well done Zombie action. The makeup was really great, the effects were cool, and overall, everything Zombie related was pretty well done. And although that persisted throughout the episodes, I must say that it's script is, sadly, one of the stupidest, worst written and most obnoxious ones I've watched in a long time.  Every time, every single time, a character opened their mouth or made any kind of decision, I just wished for all the cast to be eaten by zombies right then and there. Every single death from this first season was due not to the zombies themselves, but to every single character in the show having less common sense than a rock. Characters made the worst decisions they could have for every single scenario.  This became extremely obnoxious half through the season, and the last two chapters I just straight skipped dialogue scenes because I couldn't bear to watch more of the plot.  The zombies are cool tho, so if you are a fan of the genre, I guess it's still enjoyable to some extent. Just be prepared for the plot."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,Excellent series with lots of emotions mixed by koreans  Koreans really know how to make a zombie flick!  Great character building and introduction of the different plotlines.  Two episodes in and it's mayhen and chaos all over the school!  As you go on more characters and different situations are presented and it all unfolds perfectly.  It is really well paced and non-stop action. A dramatic scene here and there but not too much to get you bored.  Freaky zombie outbreak like I've never seen before (only in Train to Busan).  I can't wait to see how it all plays out.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"The vibe I got from the trailer was that of a censored version of The highschool of dead anime. However, its superior in every aspects. Even though the story has a major plot hole but the background score, cinematography and stunts completely filled those voids. The sense of story telling with the aspect of time is a major win for this series. But the prospect of a thick plot and dense character study looses all its volume with a hurried ending. I would not say that its a ""must watch"" but a ""good watch"" indeed."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"I don't get those people giving bad reviews about All of us Are Dead! I enjoyed every episode from start to finish. It never loses its momentum. In fact, 12 episodes to me are not that long. I am hoping for a season 2.  This show covers everything relevant to societal issues like the pandemic, bullying, political influence, pressure of getting into college, family relationships, friendship, love, human behaviours. I love how they included the youtuber character because he's not just for comedy but it's a reality that people would do stupid thing just for social media views.  I like how they got into detail of the origin of the virus and the mechanism of the virus. Most zombie movies don't go into detail with the origin of the virus (usually it's chemical spill and things like that).  Each episode keeps you wanting more and the actors played their parts perfectly. The female protagonist, On-Jo is a very realistic character. She's not one of those badass superhero frontal heroine but like most of us, she's an ordinary girl who has to deal with the pain of losing loved ones and yet keep going for the ones who are still alive.  This show isn't just about surviving or killing zombies. It shows you every human relationship. In this show, although they show you how cruel humans can be, it also highlights the good side of humans and how one is willing to sacrifice for the good of others.  The side stories are all put together very well, without spoiling the main plot. I disagree with the comments saying there are too many unnecessary plots or characters because every side story has an impact and every character has a story to tell.  Plot wise, acting wise, visuals, effects, everything is phenomenal. 10/10 absolutely!"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"One of the best netflix series. Why I really love it because of scenes which we never saw in american pop-corn movies. Like the best characters, whom we love from hearth, they also die (some of them). The evil is relativized. Also there are astonishing secrets, which we (viewers) know, but in the series, the characters never find out. You never know what will happens, full of surprises. Also the best in this series, there aren't any force moral lessons. The things just happens, and you cannot say, what is good and what is bad behaviour, just like in real life."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,6,,"The shows bring nothing new compared to other zombies tv shows/movies. I'm 4 episodes into it and it's really slow, the characters are so cliches and the whole thing is boring."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"This serie is clearly an adaptation of Highschool of the dead Manga series which sadly stopped. After the first couple of episodes I like it a lot, the acting is very good. Zombies are superb as you might expect from Korean Zombie genre."

I'm used to characters in horror movies and series making idiotic decisions, I really am, but this takes it to a whole new level. If this series tried to mock the stupidity of most horror flicks, it would be a fun little series, but unfortunately it tries to be serious. What a waste of time and brain cells. I don't understand the high ratings, but to each their own I guess."

The way they created the scene and casted actors, everything is amazing. I watch even stupid zombie movies, but this one was done really really well. Go for it. After Kingdom, train to busan this is one of best next gem from Korean cinemas. Congrats to all the team !!"

Harsh, brutal and gory at times, exactly what you would expect.  That's how a zombie series/movie is made. Zac Snyder could watch and learn.  Pure awesomeness!  If you like the zombie topic, this is for you.  Two thumbs up!!"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"A lot of zombie stuff has been done and there's only so much creativity you can come up with if it's already been done. So, when someone comes up with a new show, it's intriguing because I'm curious to see what's different about this one. This show is your typical Zombie but story set in a high school. It's got something for everyone.  The zombie parts of the show were done REALLY WELL. Acting, action choreography, sound design, cinematography - everything was top-notch. Then there's your typical high school story that was a hit/miss. There's commentary on the society & family values - this added depth to the plot.  Overall - it's a decent show with a lot of thrills but with minor pacing issues here and there, think Marvel trying to insert random jokes just because they can. They work, but seem out of place. The show has 12 eps, so this is a decent commitment. Could have been 8 eps, maybe 9.  If you go down this road, you'll leave satisfied/non-disappointed by the end. If you'll be mind blown or not, is up to your taste."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,Loved it from start to finish. Every episode leaves with suspense. I recommend this everyone to watch it. You never get bored from start to finish. Waiting for season 2./
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,6,,"Mostly dragging on to much, with wooden acting and just laughable dialogue. Its pretty boring most of the time, with hilarious scenes in which main characters dodge dozens of zombies in narrow corridors becaus plot armor. Emotional impact missing, some deaths just random and some ... lets say weird superpowers. If one had started to fly at the end, I would not hav been surprised.  Made it to episode 6 before checking out.  It is well crafted in some regards, hence a 6 out of 10. But you won't miss out much if you don't watch it."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,6,,"I like watching a good zombie movie or show from time to time. So I gave this show a chance after seeing the trailer. Overall I'd say it's decent but has various problems as well.  I think the acting overall is fine but I'll say that I watched it in Korean with English subtitles. As always you may want to be careful with English dubs.  Something I've noticed with Korean shows is that kids/students seem to be pretty nasty and unlikable overall. Is that a common thing in South Korea? You got bullies that actually are pretty nasty criminals and other kids that basically just go along with the bullies where no one speaks out. In addition you have a school where teachers and the principal are more focused on appearances than actually teaching the students. Well, maybe it really is reflecting real life...  In this you then have a zombie outbreak scenario where to be honest I thought a lot of those characters deserved to die. The one good thing I want to mention is that the students call these things as what they are => zombies. I always get annoyed when shows try to be fancy by inventing new names for what clearly is a zombie (""walkers"" for example). The police, soldiers and other officials never call them zombies though.  The zombies overall are really inconsistent. Characters are either dying right away or will have a thick plot armor. The students in their capabilities are also very inconsistent. For the most part they will not really fight but run away. Then in some situation they seemingly suddenly mutate to combat and strategic experts just to then forget about that a few minutes later.  There is focus on some characters which makes it appear they will play a bigger role later on and then they are just killed off with no real impact. Also the way the whole situation is resolved towards the end of the first season is a bit of a letdown. I guess they were trying to create a complete story in case they will not be renewed for a second season while still keeping the door open. The result is leaving me a bit unsatisfied."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"..if the zombies in Train To Busan arent enough for u, then this Kdrama will satisfy your needs! I love every episodes! Literally the best Kdrama of the year!"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"This would be a decent and exciting 8 episode series, but 12 episodes made it a bit slower than it needed to be. Some of the scenes and story lines are unnecessarily drawn out, but there was still just enough to keep it exciting and scary.  I felt that some of the acting was questionable, but I later wondered if this could be a cultural issue (I'm from UK). In fact, the cultural aspect of this show caused me a lot of problems, and here is why...  Initially I really struggled to differentiate the characters from each other. I was surprised at this, but I am not kidding, it took me several episodes to get a grip of who was who, and even well into the show I was still making mistakes. I even Googled this, and was somewhat relieved to discover that this is a fairly well known human trait, of one race not easily telling people of other races apart from one another i.e. ""they all look the same"". I got better as the series continued but it did not add to my enjoyment of the show in the beginning. Nevertheless, there was enough character development as the show progressed for me to eventually see the different personalities coming through. I liked that they boys and girls did have their different individual personalities, it made them seem a lot more real.  Another cultural issue was the old fashioned attitudes they seemed to have towards the opposite sex. A guy says to a girl ""I like you"" and she goes to pieces. I mean, they looked to be between 16-20 years old, but were acting so shy and timid, it was more like they were about 10. The men/boys were always the leader of any situation, and the girls needed to be shouted at and encouraged to help or do anything useful.  Lastly, the attitude of the soldiers/policemen/teachers/politicians etc. Toward anyone in a position of leadership (or should I say power?). For example, the commander of the army, and the behaviour of his colleagues and staff. They were so subservient to him, they acted like little boys, shuffling their feet and squirming in front of him, eyes averted. The politician lady - her staff were always grovelling to her. I found this difficult and frustrating to watch. It was as though they were not worthy of an opinion, or unable to question the decisions of ""the boss"".  I would have given a higher score but these things were quite a big distraction for me."

Just fight and stop pushing zombies away and why is it taking so long for the dad to get to the school?"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"The show started in a brilliant way and I thought this would be some unique in the zombie genre. As things were shown in a very realistic way. But, the way the episodes moved forward I started to lose interest. As I felt some middle episodes were so repetitive & lengthy. The show didn't deserve 12 hrs runtime. After finishing the season I can say the story would've been completed within 8 - 9 hrs max. One thing I can't deny is that this show was technically brilliant.  Each character had its own story, it's not a problem for a series. But, in a Zombie apocalypse it has been shown in a very stretchy way. In the other hand, some characters didn't end up the way they should've been. As an audience we get to know so many things but the character didn't, that's the reason it was very disturbing to watch some scenes. Last 4 episodes were too much interesting and were the best episodes of the show. Good thing is that we get to know some good survival techniques.  Finally, it's not the best in zombie genre but of course A Very Good Watch.  Available on Netflix.  © Zombieddict."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"Undoubtedly, it's one of the best serial about the zombie. It's very interesting to watch how teenagers to cope with such difficult problems better than adults. Scenes with zombie looks very realistic and I hope for the season two."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"Ok, it's not the 'Train to Busan stopping first at high school' that I had hoped it would be but I quite enjoyed it. It might benefit from there being a bit of a lull in good stuff being released right now though(?).  It basically follows the progress of a couple of groups of kids (most focus being on the the one, larger group) as they try to escape the zombie infested high school.  Along the way, stuff happens - some more interesting than others, some of it is really quite stupid and there are times when I felt like switching off but am glad I didn't. The first episode or two in particular are a bit... iffy...  Watch it expecting a Young Adult horror series and you'll enjoy it more than if you go into it expecting it to be outright horror."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"A really enjoyable thriller of a zombie outbreak in korea, most of the characters are really well written, a few plot holes, but other than that this show was worth binge watching."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,6,,They overrated the drama the series was just crying and surviving i guess this is korean drama it's not interesting or the story so ridiculous kids can make better zombie series better than this.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"It's the first zombie series that I've watched with sufficient amount of time given to explanations about the causes, govt reactions and research. Add to that an effort for the character building, two types of zombies as well as interesting ending.  This series is quite unique in that sense, and that's why I am giving it an 8.  What I didnt like is generally seen in almost all Korean movies and series: too long stares between actors, their slow reactions, aggresive behaviour of women which are hitting guys all the time for no reason. The way Korean girls run is always clumsy with their hands down. Girls always yell on guys for no reason, they never yell on them etc.  There are also some unreasonable things that bothered me, like not looking for food, water nor toilet in days.  But all in all, i would recommend this movie to those who specifically like this genre as there are some unique and never-seen before ideas. Hopefully producers of other future zombie movies will pay attention and develop on that, as zombie genre really needs this kind of refreshment, to move away from boring and simplified 'chase and kill' action."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,6,,"After watching so many zombie movies and series, this one doesnt have anything new and exciting to offer. The characters have no depth and the scenes are predictable and not believable. All of the episodes are just endless acrobats and running around. It such a shame because some of the actors are actually good."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"Loved the character arcs, the unexpected twists (literally nothing goes the way you'd expect it to for any character) a thoroughly enjoyable experience with a particularly poignant final episode. Cannot wait for season two."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,,,I've been watching zombie movies for 30 years. I have watched or attempted to watch every movie or show containing zombies.  This one is definitely the worst. It's pointless and ridiculous nonsense. I could only watch the first episode and less than ten minutes of the second one.  This show is bad beyond compare.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,6,,I watched all episodes. Overall it was a good watch. Sometimes it becomes boring too see some long conversations. They seem to be usesless. Yes i understand there is a philosophy about this show but they don't need to smash it all the time.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"In general, I would say this is a very good show. I admit there are some flaws in some plots. You can still call this zombie show a good one. It covers a lot of topics. High school campus life, school bullying, society problems, politics, friendship, love, humanity. All of this elements in one show, compared with some other zombie show, this one is extraordinary."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"I liked this show. It was a good experience watching this and I was screaming when the zombies suddenly came. The most appreciated thing about this series was the makeup, the location and all the things that make zombies look real."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"I don't think it's bad, it's entertaining, the plot is nothing to write home about, it's really quite common, zombie infection at school with teenagers? Very common, but even so it does it well, it is entertaining, inside if it is well built you can see how it is at the beginning, why, how it spreads little by little and the obstacles they face.  It has a good development, and it looks like it is going to affect the entire city and its surroundings little by little, it does not suffer from having many cliches and it really is entertaining that at the end of everything it is what it is looking for, to entertain you, it will not be the series of the year, not much more, but it falls within the range of entertaining, it is quite good and if you are looking for a series for an afternoon to entertain yourself, this is one of those, it is highly recommended."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,6,,"Survivors are ignoring their instincts. Characters' deeds are not logical. For the eleven episodes, no one decided to make a weapon to fight zombies. I watched that with embarrassment. Good CGI, though. If you like movies where people only run from place to place, mainly doing stupid things on the way, this one is definitely for you. Great potential lost miserably."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"The dialogue gets a lot of criticism, but as a teacher in S. K. it's on par with the speak. Their interactions, barring the two psychos, is everyday here. The only criticism I have is to the episodes. Episode 11 was the perfect send off for the show - dark, mysterious and ambiguous. They pushed forward and made a twelfth which not only had a different, child like tone; where all dread, fear and the doom had been replaced by joyful wonder. The first 11 episodes took place in a 3 day run. I know that childhood conditioning is rife here and that'd take some time to overcome or break free from, but the 12th episode is 3 months later. These children who've experienced the darkest situations should no longer approach life like children.  Let's just say...if you watch till the end you can expect disappointment."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,6,,"I love the series but my annoyance kept piling up because I thought it was a Korea movie that I shouldn't raise my expectations. Not until I saw squid game, with it episodes less than 10. They tried to make it as real as possible and it became a huge success...  Why will a Commander commit suicide because he ordered the execution of a small town so as to contain the virus. Thus saving million.. In US such scenerio are called COLLATERAL DAMAGE.  No one would persecute him for that!!!  I love the K-drama because they are growing so fast and rapid but 90% of their series makes me so mad at the end. I had to stop watching Lee Min Ho because his movies are too childish and his acting too.. not talking about the good looks.  I had to recommend this series to a lot of my colleagues after watching the first 6 episodes... And you guys kept disappointing me thereafter.  Especially the zombie bully running around the school, he should have been eliminated.. and some scenes are just too dumb.  Like Nam ra father sacrificing himself... Come on, I'm a fictional writer.. some sacrifice are just too stupid likewise Na Yeon mom, that's the most disappointing moment ever.  Tz_Chilest."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,5,,"I just finished this show, and it certainly was entertaining.  However, it's (very) flawed. Also, I think the target audience is way younger than me.  It definitely has some highlights though, and is a well-made series. The FX are pretty neat, and some fight scenes are badass. I really like the ""no mercy at all"" attitude of the whole thing too.  I don't watch many movies/shows from Korea, and what I was thinking about this one in particular is why the actors don't have any ""feelings"". They all seem very cold and (almost) never smiles or anything. Even when they cry they look the same as when they don't. Is this a Korean thing - or just a thing in this show?"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,I loved this series a thrilling ride to start to finish. I was gripped and loved the characters. The Koreans really are at the top of their game. Hollywood watch out.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"Intense and doesn't let up. I had to stop a few times to take a few breaths.  The perfect zombie flick, except it is 12 episode long. Koreans do indeed do zombies justice.  Ignore those naysayers, just watch it. At least you'll get the ride of your life."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,As korean i was disappointed.  The original webtoon is more great than it.  All story is boring.  And it is cliché lump There are too many useless scene.  I don't know why this drama is NETFLIX 1st.  It is just for killing time.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"I thought this series was entertaining throughout. A good zombie flick with a solid crew of main characters. I binged this series over 3 days. Any zombie fan out there would enjoy this series, highly recommend. I took off 1 star due to they typical horror flick where you think to yourself, ""no don't do that"". But not enough times to get cheesy. The zombies are not the smartest, but they sure are fast. I find that the recent flicks from Asia are indeed worthy of watching. There is the right amount of chase, dialogue, drama, and suspense. If you are looking for something to watch, as I do, definitely give it a try. In my opinion, limited series are always the best."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,6,,"Pretty standard overly dramatic k zombie, the way the characters written are pretty dumb, but then again they are high school students so i guess they were supposed to be dumb? The ever so often comedic bits are pretty much what gets me through watching the while thing. In conclusion, scientist oppar is hot af."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"I put off watching this and eventually started the first episode and binged it and finished it as fast I could. I binged squid game in a day but couldn't with this for various reasons, none of it being my lack of interest.  It definitely gets some things from train of busan but that isn't bad because that's a great movie itself. I thought 12 episodes was going to be too long but would have liked another episode rather than a subtle hint that could lead to another season. It should end with the last episode.  The thing that intrigued me the most is the zombie and the sets and how hard it must have been to put makeup on all of them and dress them accordingly and the effort of rehearsal to get some of these scenes done right. This absolutely deserves many awards. The acting from the kids is meh but everything else is top notch."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,6,,"I like that type of movies, but I couldnt stand this one, was watching with my wife, but we stopped at 2 episode, as it was simply boring.  You can give it a try if you are desperate to watch anything."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,5,,"I was really looking forward to finally get some frightening, suspensful and cleverly written story with unexpected and shocking or sad twists.  Instead I was fed with episodes which are almost identical one to onother and with a story that seemed to be written by a teenager during a lesson break."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"This series is really amazing wait for 2nd season. This is one of the greatest series in netflix and also korea .I am really surprised and So many congratulations all of cast and all of us Dead,s members."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"From starting to end, not a single second seemed boring, neither the ending is predictable nor the characters you will think definitely survive will survive. It's gory, it's emotional, it's amazing. Just don't believe in bad reviews, they must have bad taste. From the first episode you'll see how amazing this series is and you'll end up binged watching it. If you like Train To Busan, you're going to love All Of Us Are Dead."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"Some very cringey moments, idiotic decisions made by characters and it drags too but once you get used to it you can get hooked.  Not the best Zombie show out there but it's quite entertaining. Hope they make Season 2."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,I finish this series in one day 😂 to be honest it's very catchy and thise who dislike this zkdrama after watching 1-2 episodes imma advice you guys to take your time and give it another shot because it will be worth! Good and interesting things happen on the middle of the show not at first! You have to be patient. I can't wait for season 2 already if there is gonna be one but i hope yes! I'm obsessed!!! 10 stars from me.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"It is the best zombie apocalypse series I have ever seen.  Every character justice their role. As a student, I can relate to the characters easily. I love bonding between them. Love, compassion, friendship, fun everything.  Sound effects, VFX all are top-notch. Korean made the best movies, series no doubt.  The last of this series has a great twist.  Hope it's session 2 coming very soon early waiting."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"All of Us Are Dead is fine.  But it is a conceptually very juvenile show. The whole origin of the epidemic is difficult to digest. This series has a certain bizarre tone, that tries to balance the drama, comedy and action-horror, but it doesn't always work. Or it won't work for everyone the same way.  Having said this. I had fun. The various points of view on the zombie apocalypse are very well made. Action scenes are great. And the overall production value is pretty decent. There are several characters I liked, and I was sorry to see some of them being dismembered.  Despite having some problems with the more childish elements of the narrative, this series, in general, provided me with good times.  But it's definitely not as refined as Squid Game. Despite being very ambitious in its proposal.  I rate this series 7.5 out of 10."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"One of the best zombie series out there. Don't believe ,check it out. Let me tell you Zombie isn't my thing. I'm shocked how I fell in love with the series.  (I suck at reviews , hope you get wht I mean to say)  The characters are so well written and so well played, one can clearly see the human behaviour and how they change according to situation.  The friendship ,the way the characters stepped up sacrificing themselves for others , so selfless , so bold and so touching. Every character has it's deapth ever sacrifice had it's meaning , totally touched by this series , I wish you wld too.  ( P.s - I'm in love with the character Lee CheongSan , man hez the real hero )"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"Over all I believe it's a well done series.  One thing I did notice that was completely wrong was the students debating the meaning of the distress signal S-O-S. They are debating this in the episode where they're on the school roof top. The female student who's father was an EMT says that SOS doesn't mean anything, that it's not an acronym. It does in fact stand for SAVE OUR SHIP.  Not sure the writers can get more than one series out of this. Just my opinion."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,1,,"Honestly looks like they had everything (budget) to make this a great tv show unfortunately is horrible and poorly written.  The characters omg , where should l start?  Are we suppose to do think that teens in schools are so dumb?  Zero skills to survive or think head ?  One of the main character the fight fighter daughter , shockingly slow and dumb or maybe she has some mental issues?  But overall all the characters super sad, pathetic, useless.  Why did the writers write such a thing?  Not even one of them was switch on.  Also some flashbacks about happy memories super super cheesy  maybe if you are a boy/girl under 10years old you might love it but if you have some decent intelligence you might feel this is extremely sad and dumb.  Example they see someone no zombie yet and they wait until he/she become a zombie and then they start screaming :P instead of killing it before . That happened many many times.  And many others situation are actually hard to watch.  The Adults acting is actually very bad too.  Like l said before its a shame because they had all to make this great.  And instead they made everyone useless and no charismatic at all.  I couldn't have any sympathy with any of them at all.  Please try to make it a little realistic at least a little this was sad."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"This Korean TV show just left me wanting more. In fact every episode leaves me wanting more. How do Korean movie directors manage to achieve this hangover effect. The acting is flawless with these kids. And the Zombie CGIs are top notch with gory scenes.  Just like HELL BOUND, I am asking 'When will Season 2 be released already'😕"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"It's in a few words: amazing. Very entertaining and emotional. Safe to say it's also very heartbreaking... When an episode ends you always want to watch the next one, making this an amazing binge watch (if your heart can handle it) . Lovable, and hatable characters that you really want to keep on watching, since you have built in hopes for their futures. The only reason I'm giving it a 9 instead of a 10 is because my favourite character died :) and if he's back for the second season, I'll be changing that rating despite the tears that I've shed. You won't regret watching this! Amazing zombie thriller series."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,,,Only on episode 3 and already hooked this is brilliant.  Everything is so good about this show. Its so freaking scary love it!  This show is so good that anyone who likes horror should watch it.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,6,,"This is a Korean teenage zombie drama. It's exactly as expected. Overdramatic, cringey, cheesy but simultaneously, intense, well directed/well produced, gory and it doesn't hold back. I mean, noone is safe here, even the heroes/heroines may die. There are also many funny/warm scenes. Many awkward, too.  It's definitely not bad, it's rarely boring and the action is good. If it was a movie, i would probably recommend it but it's a 12 hours tv series. Too long for a ""not bad but also not too good"" tv series to make you invested and watch. At some point, i just wanted it to end and i didn't care much about the characters. These are not uninteresting characters, and many of them were likeable. Still not interesting enough for a 12 hours tv series though.  If you are under 30 years old, maybe you will find this tv show more appealing.  Finally, i would like to say that i love Korean cinema, there are countless good/great movies filmed in the last 20-ish years. However, Korean actors/actresses need to be improved. They should be better at their job. Less cringey, less overdramatic. It is not entirely their fault, directors are liable/responsible too, probably more. Korean movie industry is strong and movies/series are getting more and more popular. That makes me happy because i really love Korean cinema. This is just an opinion from a well-intended person."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"I don't understand all the bad ratings, I really liked it. Some characters not so much, but in general I really liked it. It was entertaining and comical."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"It's thrilling and fun. In particular, after Kyung-soo turned into a zombie, he was able to immerse himself in the drama. My time melted gently. I was deprived of time. I'm sure you feel the same way."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"It's a good show. Sometimes too long. Could have been shorter at about 8 episodes. I found myself just forwarding lot of moments and during that nothing happened. Just people watching into each other eyes. And that's a lot of minutes. Sometimes, i questioned a lot of decisions. But reminded myself these are just a bunch of kids who are supposed to be 15-17 years old. In addition, this is happening in an Asian society so a lot of decision makings are just different from kids who are in a western country.  The Character developments are okay. We see different types so it'll be easy for people to recognize themselves in the kids.  Some comedic moments are added to the show to lighten it. Some scenes are just gore.  The ending leaves space for a part 2.  Overall it's a good show to watch. Not perfect. But good."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"And... I have seen a lot. The thrill and action with which this series kept me latched to episode after episode - I loved it.  The cast did great acting, became a fan of a few actors. Screenplay was amazing, editing was crisp, the zombies were believable (quintessential zombies) and it is worth a second season. I hope to see the characters again.  Great job team ""all of us are dead"""
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"First moment, it started well but by going end of it, it becomes miserable Korean emotional drama.  I couldn't understand characters, I couldn't understand their decisions. Over actings against their families and friends made feeling so stressed.  Too much dramas for zombie action. The original webtoon was kind of this, but they shouldn't apply this kind of unnecessary things.  And why they chose those bad actors?"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,1,,"It's not even good, yet people rate higher than 1 star. Slow pacing, lots if unecessary dialogue, conflicts were forced, and mutations were so random. I love zombie movies, but this is just meh. Wasted my time. Skipped through every single episode just to get to the ""good"" parts."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"This is a big budget, large cast, tightly-scripted zombie (near) apocalypse TV series written as a miniseries. I'm saddened to think that there might not be a season 2 since there was complete closure at series end.  Very bingeable, great character depth and development as the series progresses. I had one problem with the series that keeps it from getting a higher rating (it's an 8 rating, a 10 rating for overall entertainment):  There were too many scenes where the core group of students just stood there like deers caught in headlights, while a single member of the group did most of the battling. Also little prep, no weapons.  It happened too often and it wasn't until a second older group of students emerged (senior class, the archers) that appeared more suited to surviving and behaved more like expected. They also understood the importance of arming themselves.  I understand the paralyzing fear and their younger ages (+/- 16 years) being a factor. I understand that this is how any younger group might react (so it was well-written in this regard) but it was still frustrating to see this as an adult.  Side note: This is the fifth South Korean TV series I've watched in the last few months. All (except 1) have been really good TV.  Recommended (in no specific order):  -- Hellbound / JioK  -- Squid Game / Ojing-eo geim  -- All of Us Are Dead / Jigeum Uri Hakgyoneun  -- Sweet Home / Seuwiteuhom  xx The Silent Sea (Failed for me)  On my watch list:  -- Glitch / Geullichi."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"Loved this! I don't think there was a single episode that didn't keep me on the edge of my seat!  It had a little of everything, plenty of violence, funny moments and some really touching moments which won't be everyone's cup of tea if they just want a run of the mill zombie movie!  I thought it was fantastic, ended on a cliff hanger so already looking forward to the next season!"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"The friendship and their loyalty was the best thing that the show represents. When it comes to movie between life and death and you want the actors to make the best decision instead of irritating and selfish ones well this is it.  Ive never been so satisfied with the characters and their decisions. Their loyalty, love, perseverance and tolerance. Each character brings so much presence in their own right.  On the plus side. Park Solomon is easy on the eyes. And so are the rest. But he shines like never before."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,Some of the characters were a little annoying and the romantic interests felt just a bit silly and somewhat ill fitting given it's an apocalyptic scenario. I felt it was aimed at a predominantly teen audience and that it was really quite laboured with not a great deal happening given that it was over 11 hours of TV. It could easily have been done in 8 episodes. Those criticisms aside it was otherwise reasonably entertaining.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"Yes, some holes are there in plot but but.  They are very very minimal.  All the show was done with very good highdrama and action and complete realistic zombie series ever made in entire cinema world.  Friendship, Honesty,Love, Survival, right to live was portrayed very well.  10/10 rating was very less i will give 1000/10 .  The efforts they had made to make this series is very greatest."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"The show doesn't pretend to be intellectual or sophisticated. It is straight up what a good classic zombie drama should be- packed with heart-thumbing action throughout, characters that one can relate to and despite being helm by a primarily a young cast of high school students, everyone delivered their roles really well, and some really emotional & heartbreaking moments towards the end."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,1,,"If u are expecting it to be like kingdom or train to busan. Then this is not it. Storyline' s a bit mundane, some actings are -meh-. Reviewers here are smitten by the cute Koreans actors period and nothing more. So expect bias reviews and ""don't listen to hater"" quotes used. SIMPS reviews are not actual reviews so do yourself a favour don't waste bingeing this series like I did. You are better off re watching the other awesome zombie series/movies."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"A nearly perfect zombie series... definitely worth watching... The rating should be above 8 star Underrated... Again proved that korean dramas makers are 🔥🔥 creativity, story, visuals, technicalities, choreography.."

지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,Very well-paced! It was interesting to see zombies all over the school. I couldn't keep my eyes off as the story unfolded.  It was so much fun! Trust me.. you will love this series.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,Amazing series worth to watch its an interesting series with lot of emotions and fun i really enjoyed it. Forget about bad reviews just go for it.the actors acting is also really good i hope they will make season two of this.i know that koreans never disappoint us while making these type of contents.the visual effects are also really good......
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,6,,"""All of Us Are Dead"" marks the latest high-budget Korean release from Netflix, fighting for room in a genre already groaning from the weight of the likes of ""Kingdom,"" ""Squid Game"" and ""Hellbound.""  Posh Hyosan High School and its affluent pupils think it's going to be just another day of working towards tests and surviving the bullies, deadlines and awfulness of puberty that high school crams daily into 7 hours. But then one student comes stumbling in, claiming a teacher abducted her, and before lunch is over, the entire school, save for a handful of stragglers, will either be dead or dying.  Netflix's show sets up its premise well. The premier, having to do a hell of a lot of world building, manages to establish key characters and relationships without too much exposition, and finds some potential drama and tension it can explode apart later. Then the promise is fulfilled in episode 2, which begins with an absolute massacre in the school cafeteria as the confusion and fear of what is happening mixes with more blood than a Wes Craven film. Beautifully shot and well executed, it never lets the gas off the pedal.  Sadly, the show then begins to fall under the weight of what it wants to do, and what it needs to do. We get four main threads to follow involving politicians and rescue services, a good natured police officer, and two main groups at the school. That's not including the parents, other surviving school students or faculty, or secret services that need paid attention to, also. By episode 5, there's so much going on (and so many barriers to any progress) that the momentum stalls and the show, despite the numerous chase scenes, resembles a dog chasing its tail.  Further, the characters are just horrible. Not badly written, no, but evil, inconsiderate monsters. One may forgive them on account that they're young, privileged and facing a fantastical problem, but even resident bully, Gwi-Nam, is just one of many monsters wearing people faces. It gets tiring to see the students sabotage and ruin one anothers' chances over and over again. Redemption is a banned word in this universe, and Neitzche would likely baulk at the pessimism on display.  Lastly, the zombie virus is just too complicate to understand. In this world, some people don't fully turn, allowing them to develop super powers while maintaining their identities. I don't understand how a virus can increase strength and speed without boosting muscle mass, but here we've got kids going at each other like a Rita Repulsa monster smacking down the Power Rangers. Who gets this mutated virus is also arbitrary, with only three people getting this lucky dose (and obviously each is integral to the story).  Still, when all is said and done, there's some great fun to be had here. The first four episodes alone are worth catching, and as the kids' relationships take center stage in the middle, the cast prove proficient at being good dramatic actors. Even as it lags, there's no denying it's a treat to watch, with scenes of destruction exploding into zombie herds chasing down unlucky survivors. The tension, as threads are cut, snaps in a very satisying way. But, in the end, it's five episodes too long, and plays the same cards too often to be as successful as, say ""Kingdom."""
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,4,,"3 episodes in and I'm waiting to give a crap about any of these characters. None of them are likeable, or particularly smart or clever. The perfect show to watch while on your phone."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"Imo I thought the first episode was a bit slow to get to the zombie outbreak and boy was I happy when it did.  I find how the virus was made a little interesting, nothing mind blowing, but interesting. I think the only thing that gets me are the points where the writing is dumbed down so the plot can move forward. The best moment I can think of is when a kid calls the authorities. I sat there and repeated ""please don't be stupid and say ""zombies are attacking students at my school""."" and then the student brings up Train to Busan, which you should watch if you haven't yet. So far this is a good zombie series.  Some points off for writing and pacing but still good."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"Each and every episode just hooked n booked but only the last episode of the series little bit slow n length of episode felt ,but at the conclusion I just wanna say it's completely horror + thriller combo which is made must watch drama."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"Love these Korean zombies series fast paced great action what not to love about it . Why better than British zombie movies . I want more. Don't understand negative reviews , not to be taken to seriously delicious fun everything you want in zombie series ,prefer films myself but this one of the better series I have watched."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,This is actually a masterpiece.. Korea knows how to dissolve someone's heart .. they provide best zombie cinematic with lots of emotions and all characters are frictional..
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,6,,"I like Korean horror films but this series is kind of lazy. Fast zombies, frantic action, some good gore, but then it's just more but slightly different. Some of the slower scenes were scarier by far.  And I like an honest answer to this. Do Korean schools have that serious a bullying problem??!! That was a f-ed up. Seriously. The adults too. Wth.  The few things that gave a glimpse in Korean culture are always appreciated. The school itself was kind if interesting and reminded me a little of when I visited a Japanese elementary school.  Bottom line - It was fun for a while and then I just stopped watching early in episode 3. More of the same."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,You know korea has made many amazing zombies movies and they never disappoint us. This movie is also one of the best zombies. You should definitely try this.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"Decent show - I will admit reading the other reviews I can kind of understand peoples opinions about the first 2 episodes, they are arguably the weakest, and things really pick up in episode 3 and especially in episode 4. Overall though, it's fun, jumpy, some fun characters and awesome zombie chase scenes. Another solid Korean flick - ignore the haters."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"This Korean fun and thriller show is a really great example of how students think when they are in school when they ""daydream"". The show has few really great twist and turns that makes the show more fun and lovable to watch. One season is only there but from the start till the end the show will not let you leave your seats. Yes there are a few loopholes but every movie or series have them but the good thing is that more good things are there to talk about. In short a really good and fun show to watch if one loves zombies."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,5,,"Not sure how this got 7.7.  It's not ""that bad"" but it's also not very good either. Everything gets very repetitive and/or very ridiculous VERY quickly, and this is someone that stuck with the dumpster fire TWD until the end.  This review is totally ignoring how the writers chose at PURE WILL to FIT THEIR MEDIOCRE scripts just how long it takes to turn into a zombie after being bitten. 5 seconds? Yeah sure, if it fits the script. 5 minutes? Yeah sure, if it fits the script and the person bitten needs to give an emotional goodbye,  Not a terrible show, not a very good one either."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"If you are watching this show only for the gore (like some of the low ratings here), it is not for you.  Yes, there are very bloody moments and somewhat unbelievable zombie sequences, but that is a mere fraction of what this show is aiming towards. Under the ""zombies"" and ""fighting"", there is excellent emotional tension and moral exploration. From the students to the officials, the implications of moral judgement are monumental to the progression of the plot. Within the inhumanness, the interactions of such characters entrance us into a somewhat first-hand view of their relationships, where the threats from the ""zombies"" are often side-lined. This led to a truly well rounded series. This is matched with a great musical score, good direction (mostly) and excellent performances all around.  There are a few things I didn't like. Firstly, there are many scenes where it feels alot like a soap opera. Characters freeze up way too often, and such moments are quite cliche.  Secondly, the girls in this episode, (except one) are extremely sterotypical, and to an extent, useless. Most of them just stand around and whine, sometimes even when the group is being attacked. They after running two steps, they can't get up, they sulk and cry instead of fighting back. I would like to see more women step up and become emotionally and physically strengthened.  In general, All of Us Are Dead is a thrilling show that often side-lines the blood and gore of a traditional zombie show for a emotionally charged and humane primary plot. It is at times stereotypical and cliché, but it is an excellent binge-watch. I had an excellent time watching it, its topping the Netflix charts, and I would certainly recommend it."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,6,,"I liked every thing about it besides watching zombies chasing people down a school hall for the 12,000th time! It still kept me interested and invested in the story but sometimes it did feel like a slog. Could probably have cut two episodes worth of zombies running around."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"I have nothing really negative at all to say about this show it's pretty perfect! Just enough episodes and character arch stories and build, each episode wanting you to keep going. Lots of drama, thrills and omg moments, I cried a lot because this was making me an emotional wreck. I just love it! The cast, the pace of the show! I really hope they continue as there is still more to unfold with it's ending and the hambie's!"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,6,,"Well, as a Netflix production, this is way better than this piece of garbage that is Squid Game, (probably because it is based on a webtoon, so they already had the origin material) but I would not call it best tv series of 2022!  The characters lack a bit of personality and charisma, and there's unecessary teenage drama too. Most of the characters and events are predictable, there's no surprises.  Still, it is a decent show to watch, but I had to fast forward lot of boring stuff.  There are way better Korean TV series out there! (Taxi driver, Signal, Hapiness, Sweet Home, Strangers from Hell, Uncanny Counter, Mouse etc...)"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"I felt compelled to write a review just because someone compared this to High School of the Dead. This wasn't similar in any way.  I actually think the zombies in this show were quite horrifying. I liked the depressing tone, the scary visuals, and the gore. I liked that anyone could die at any time. There were a lot of terrible decisions by the main cast, but overall I found this to be enjoyable."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,6,,"I was quite excited when I first heard about another zombie Korean thriller. I didn't particularly have high expectations for this one but I did hope it would be memorable. It's way too long with many unnecessary plotlines. I think it could have been perfectly wrapped up in 8 episodes if properly executed. The main characters were dull to me and I couldn't relate to any of them,especially Nam Ra.  There were way too many foolish decisions that were only introduced for shock value and character development. I don't see myself revisiting this show unlike the others I've watched of its kind."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"Although there were some minor illogic scenes but overall its good. Its not a waste even its a paid drama. Its too short though, should be 16 or 20 episodes.  The ending reveals that there will be a sequel which I can't wait."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,1,,"Netflix's bots are rating this up, otherwise I don't understand how this could be a +7 / almost 8 serie. Do you a favor and don't loose time with this one."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"Guess what this Gen Z said ""This show is so violent "" lol what ? This is zombie apocalypse not romance, do you think this is Hollywood when there's kisses and nudity and cringy criticism? No this is korean they work so hard , they have incredible actors and all the crews behind camera , this is not WARM BODIES OR WORLD WAR Z , if you want no violent shows go somewhere in Netflix you will find bunch of garbage, btw I loved this series and I hope to see more of this story in future because we all now that netflix doesn't care if you liked or not ,they care about views numbers if this is successful so 100% there's s2 and 3 ."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"Wow is it really stressful to watch #AllOfUsAreDead ? I really want to tune in but seeing all of the reaction makes me think twice lol. What else is there to say about this series once for sure, even those who like zombies must see it."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"""All of us are dead"" is a classic zombie drama with a lot of action, thriller and horror elements. Even though the story is nothing groundbreaking, it doesn't fail to deliver enjoyment to the viewers that seek for zombies and epic action.  My overall impression of the drama's story is not very great, not very bad either. It was a mediocre story and there were many unnecessary and illogical things for me to accept. Also, several same (or almost same) things and events happened which made the story repetitive and tedious at times. What I liked the most, was how it manages to show how differently everyone acts in order to survive or to save someone else."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,,,"Low budget and the story really sucks it is very slow. The characters are all very annoying, it's just dumb. I think the writers like bullies. If you want to waste time getting annoyed you might want to watch this. This show is not for me."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,6,,"Okay so the good - it's fun, the pacing works well and keeps you interested. The characters are played by young actors to reflect their high-school personas. Overall the concept is great and it starts off very promising. There's also some original strategies to escaping the zombies which is nice to see.  Now for the bad - the writing has no direction. Characters are built up over episodes only to be wasted away in minutes. The build up to pay off ratio, in terms of plot and character development for each character, feels completely unbalanced and poorly considered.  This wasteful storytelling becomes frustrating at the midway point where it's easy to stop caring about anything or anyone since it seems like the writers also don't seem to care."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,1,,"If you are in a zombie-infested school, survival should be your top priority but not these kids. It would be understandable if the premise of the story is that they are unaware that zombies exist but these kids have sited a famous zombie Korean movie in their script so that would not be the case. After that line, all of the scene just don't make sense anymore. I mean only four people thought of protecting their bodies when going out? Even their concerns and problems are not pertaining to survival but on foolish dilemmas like going to the bathroom hygienically and ending up in a worse possible solution? Hoping it would make things lighter and funny. But honestly It just grossing me out! Who wrote that!? Thinking about food and water supplies for these kids could have been better right? Even the government's concern and decision in this series just don't make sense. Like really?? Maybe the writers can learn from ""Lost in Space"" or ""#Alive""."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,This show is very good Teen age drama in me made this even better An Emotional Touch Development From Esme Joe Characters Is Also Good And yah show is nothing less than a masterpiece to me So go and hurry to the show look at.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"It was fascinating Zombi series. Wow. I don't know how Korean entertainment companies make these kind of shows.  All of Us Are Dead was shocking and fascinating, so I couldn't stop watching next episode.  Therefore, I saw first episode to last episode right away at one day.  Then I watched this series's episodes couple more times to find some detail if there is anything special exist.  As you know, there were lots of things hidden in Squid Game Drama. Just like that, I am starting to find something special when I watch Korean dramas.  I don't know how Korean entertainment companies make this kind of tv-series and other kind of fascinating Korean movies, still I want to have any friend who work in that film company."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,6,,"I've always been a great fan of zombie shows, and was totally looking forward to this! Loved Train to Busan, Kingdom and had high hopes for this.  Love This show has great make-up effects, a fair amount of humour, and an interesting storyline. Story was unpredictable, and had good twists and turns.  Hate But throughout the movie, I felt irritated so many times by the poor decisions made by the characters - like seriously questionable kinds that resulted in unnecessary sacrifices.  Overall a good show, but 4 stars deducted from that."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"Kinda seems like they borrowed from the anime heavily and just toned down innuendo. On its own merits and typical of Korean zombie films, character development is darn good. I cared about them. Some of the slang and moments of emotion will miss the mark on American audiences. Cultural differences I suppose.  I would definitely watch a 2nd season to see how things move forward. Pacing was good after the second episode. It's entertaining and at times campy but I liked it."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"I think the director was forced to kill atleast one main character in each episode...literally one or 2 main character/s die in each of the episodes.....and the origin story was basically trash ,but the school plot was quiet interesting that makes you watch the whole season....so that is it....  conclusion: the origin story could have been better."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"Not usually a fan of zombie genre because I get annoyed by dumb decisions and obvious plot armors. But this one the dumb decisions can be excused because they're made by kids and most of the time the kids are pretty smart for their age and experience. I'm only annoyed by one bad guy being too OP, would've been 9 otherwise.  Got hooked after 1 episode and it's interesting to see high shcool drama mixed with zombie outbreak."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"The level of violence and the evil nature of the kids might be more than I could deal with. Truly some of the worst kids I've ever seen.  I love horror movies and nothing much puts me off, except this show definitely takes the cake.  Not for the faint of heart."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"It's a really interesting series, and I'm enjoying it a lot. I am a big fan of Korean media in general. I really love how it explores the characters, and their relationship of the people in the situation, because I think it really gives good character development and you really root for them. They're more than clichés and stereotypes.  The situations and story are very character driven. I also love the concept for the beginning of the whole thing.  I really love how ridiculously heroic and dramatic some of the action scenes are. You think that character should definitely be dead, but they'll heroically kung fu kick, and parkour their way out. It's also not affaid to kill anyone off and it's a really good mix of that."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"Now I like series from Korea better than series from the USA! Why is that?  This is certainly not due to the themes, because the Asian filmmakers work through what is also very popular in Hollywood: horror, zombies, violence, coming of age, supernatural powers and so on.  But what is the attraction of the films and series from Korea? Above all, that they deal with themselves and their topic without imposing a restrictive corset of rules in advance. In the United States, political correctness now rules all forms of entertainment. Small fringe groups have a stranglehold on the former dream factory and are trying to distort it according to their own moral ideas.  Luckily, wokness is not known in Korea and let's hope it stays that way for a long time to come!  ""Jigeum Uri Hakgyoneun"" rides the wave of success of ""Squid Game"" and shows an entertaining and believable mixture of coming to age and brutal zombie horror.  The result is good, albeit with some lengths.  The future of good entertainment is no longer in the USA!"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,1,,"""Don't listen to the haters"" lol. There is a reason this show has mixed reviews. The story is lacking, common sense doesn't exist, characters are inconsistent with their actions, zombie infection makes no sense, people zombifies based on length of their last farewell speech. It feels like the script was written to purposely annoy viewers.  If you're bored and have absolutely nothing to do or watch, go for it. Otherwise, you can skip this one. Go watch Squid Games. Much better than this."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"I usually hate the zombies movies, are all same and expected. But this tv show is long and super enjoyable, the effects and sounds are so perfect. The acting is totally from another level!! No American movie or series was that good! A must watch!! You will never have enough of it!"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"I love zombie movies not the low budget and corny acting zombies.. but TRAIN TO BUSAN WAS MY FAVORITE ZOMBIE MOVIE OF ALL TIME even though it's a foreign movie THAT SAYS A LOT... (Also watched the movie 5 years late after its first released)... But this show ALL OF US DEAD... people disliking this show.. lack wisdom and emotion... when this show had all the above.. including hidden messages about humanity in general if you really are paying attention.. to the casting crew, script writers and director.. VERY WELL DONE!!! Koreans films are no joke! Love it! I want season 2 ASAP!!!"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,6,,"If you are bored and nothing to watch I'll recommend this. But whenever that high school girl acting like damsel in distress i fast forward. Like come on, if you're faced on this situation adrenaline must kick in and stop being like you need someone to save you. Her character is annoying."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"All of Us Are Dead is a Korean zombie series for Netflix based on the webcomic of the same name; and that's all you need to know going into this violent series full of cynical characters trying to survive a cynical world. It's a well-done show that definitively leans into the 'survival' aspect of zombie horror, and it knows pretty damn well without the characters breaking the fourth wall.  All of Us Are Dead is sometimes a stressful watch but never does it become downright redundant like so many other zombie shows out there, and it's high-energy for morbidity never stops and it has many twists and turns along the way.  K-Dramas still seem like a niche outside of Korea, but Netflix is making damn sure they become a mainstay on television, even prompting other streaming services to host Asian Dramas from Japan, China, and of course South Korea.  Al of Us Are Dead is also confirmed to be continuing on in Season Two, but how much crazier can this zombie-fest possibly get?"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"This is not your everyday zombie flick. The twist is a huge part of it. Acting, directing, cinematography... all top notch. The actor that plays On-jo is a star. That is all."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,6,,Was a little bit more than just your standard zombie show. Had some rather funny parts too but by the end of the series the protagonists were all so unlikeable you actually just hope the zombies eat them.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"It starts out corny, predictable, bad scripting (or English Translations), and the students making absolutely horrible decisions, or not thinking of or ignoring obvious solutions, but it is entertaining enough to get you to episode 3/4 and then things get so much better. You actually care about the characters and there is some great acting, even through some of the pretty terrible English Translations and tones used by the voice over ""actors.""  It is a very good series. You will be entertained. I do hope we get a season 2. This was up there with Squid Games for me as I got further into it, minus the mental illness of Squid Games lol."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"If you enjoy watching Zombie stories ,definetly worth to see this show,i really enjoyed,great acting also funny moments,i do recommend it ,korean people ,you know how to do zombie stories and the best make up !"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"One can easily relate with the characters with lots of emotions,humour&spine chilling moments that will carry u along the series.....with the major supportcoming from the make-up and vfx dept and as usual koreans are known for their screenplay perfection this series is a must watch."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"This TV series is very good. I just loved it. Every character played their role very effectively. I really enjoyed watching this masterpiece. Though it is a zombie movie, there are many scenes which might be disturbing for some viewers but if you are interested in these type of genre, you will fall in love with this. Story is very interesting, direction is super, cinematography is next level. A series full of thriller, horror, comedy, drama, emotions everything. It consists of 12 episodes and each episode is approximately of 1 hour. But i in these 12 hours, you won't find it boring."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,,,I think most bad reviews are from those new Korean drama watchers after squid game. Korean drama and films are always known to have a slow character build up. As it's essential to get to know a character. Having said that yes it's annoying at times with these kiddish behaviour however these are teenagers after all. Regardless I would watch Korean zombies any day. Great show and great entertainment 👌
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"I won't write too much about this drama. The acting is decent. The script is OK - if you're watching with English dub, and the direction and editing are worthy of note but, at the end of the day, this is just another example of a production attempting to instill the idea that humans are violent.  Episode 4 spells it out, without trying to hide it.  Humans are inherently bad, so life without a governing body is wrought with danger.  Whatever happened to the idea - possibly born in the 60's, or earlier - that humanity is inherently good?  There are only a very small minority who find satisfaction in causing harm to the rest. Most humans would rather love their neighbour, not hate.  Good idea for a show, if you're not bored with zombies, but we should all long for the day when writers realise that the public are not idiots, who fall for the idea that every human has evil at heart. Or is this just an attempt to make every human evil, whether they intend to be or not?  It isn't just Hollyweird trying this approach, apparently.  Try harder, Korea. You may find social realism - i.e. Actual social realism - more rewarding for the audience."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,Best series with action and emotions. In this series we actually connected with all characters in the series.lot of emotional scenes In series but it's ok. Just need the next season as soon as possible.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"Ngl this is the best zombie series ever existed.  It's like a best dose for all Zombie Content Lovers 💞 Everyone's acting was on the point !  This series can make even a tough man cry ☹ I hope Netflix brings up Season 2 which will tell us what happened to Nam-Ra & according to me, i think Nam-Ra will again bring up the zombies & once again will spread the virus !  The saddest part is when he died 😢 I wasn't hoping for it but it's okY, he contributed in making the scene more emotional.  I would definitely recommend this to all the Zombie series lover out there ! It's worth the time with only 12 episodes & each episode is just a masterpiece Definitely 5 Star 🌟"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,6,,"There are many things to like about season 1.  However, it's in desperate need of editing, to cut out all the waffling that happens. Many episode felt excruciatingly long, and had to be watched over multiple sittings. It felt like thing just weren't going anywhere plot-wise.  I feel like the pacing would have been better if the season had been edited back to 8 or 10 episodes, rather than 12.  And there is sooooo much melodrama. This would be fine if the rest of the show didn't feel so drawn out and wafty.  Won't be tuning in for additional seasons."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"I'm on episode 6 and I'm hooked because of the drama with strong sociopolitical messages, not because of the zombies.  And Yes...it's long, but who cares? Why you want it to finish it so fast? Take a chill pill and be grateful it's as long as it is good too.  Also, for the animals that complain about having filler, guess what?, fillers are intended for character development and world-building support."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"I personally really enjoyed this show, though I can understand that it might not be for everyone. If you watched Train to Busan and came into this expecting something similar, you might end up feeling a bit disappointed.  That said, I found the show compelling in its own way. The suspense around each character's fate kept me hooked, and the unpredictability of who would survive added to the tension. I especially appreciated the chance to explore each character's story-it made the experience more emotional and engaging.  Overall, while it may not appeal to every viewer, I found it to be an enjoyable and suspenseful watch."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,1,,I really don't understand the logic behind all of these good reviews. Only watched two episodes and I couldn't find myself to finish the rest. The concept was good but watching a show where all the characters are dumb af is extremely aggravating and makes you want to throw the remote at the screen. Every character makes stupid decisions and just stands there and does nothing the entire time. This show was a joke. Nothing compared to the masterpiece of train to Busan.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,I just got done watching the show and I watched it in 3 days if it wasn't for my obligation throughout life I would have watched it in one day this show is absolutely incrediblevery single time you meet somebody new on the show they make you fall in love with them everyone has their own story and it really is a great telling of how people from all different walks of life social statuses Popular and unpopular People just working together and coming together when literally they have nobody else but themselves a small group of survivors from an absolute unimaginable Tragedy everything the way all plays out from the 1st episode all the way to the last episode will have you on the edge of your seat in tears screaming and cheering crying I mean I honestly don't know if I have ever watched a show as good as this show Trust me when I say I never leave reviews and I had to leave a review because of how amazing was I hope everybody Decides to give the shower chance because you will not be sorry.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"ALL OF US ARE DEAD (2022 - ) was a great and intense S. Korean zombie series. While it definitely held true to the gory nature of the zombie genre, it was also laced with a lot of unique characters and backgrounds. I was initially worried that the larger cast might make it less relatable or moving (ie when someone dies and you never got to know the character or their motives, therefore there feels less connection and empathy with the audience) but thankfully, you do really start to get an idea of everyone before things go down and during as well. It's actually the opposite case when you actually care a lot for many of them and then they start to die and it really yanks at the heartstrings.  The director / writers really did a great job at portraying the vast array of different characters and personalities and you really start rooting for some right off the bat. Many of them have their own struggles in their personal lives and the series gives you glimpses into their lives and the drama going on all the while amping up the tension and stakes as the zombie plot escalates around them.  There are some difficult and dark subject matter in this as well, aside from the violence, gore and zombie cannibalism, (such as bullying, humiliation, sexual harassment, cruelty, teen pregnancy, suicide, assault etc.) This series is pretty mature and graphic in nature and not for younger viewers. And yes, being a zombie show there's lots of violence, blood, gore, biting, eating people, self defense etc.  Overall, this was a great adrenaline fueled watch and sadly not an hopeful one at that, as many characters do die, but what do you expect from a zombie apocalypse? Not sure if there can be another season, but hopefully. Really enjoyed this one.  NOTE: It says Season 2 coming!"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"All of us Are Dead: This is a zombie Survival thriller web series. How this virus spreads from one school to the whole city and everyone is trying to save their lives, is shown in the series. The series gets interesting from the first episode itself. Direction is good but editing could have been better. Every episode is for one hour, so it gets boring at times. The work by all the actors was fantastic and the zombies looked great too. Although the concept was not new, it was heartening to see the way it was presented to us. You can definitely watch it once."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"After getting impressed by Kingdom, I was excited to watch another zombie movie by South Korea and this time set in high school premises. I really loved it tbh.. I don't know why people are giving it lower ratings. It kept me hooked to my Tv all the time... so gripping. Also the zombie action and graphic scenes are amazing n seems real. The zombie makeup is quite good. Although it was really hard to see my favourite characters die. Things you don't expect happened in this series I highly recommend you guys to watch it."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,6,,A 12 episode series dragged too far By the end I was tired of the dialogue between the characters the unbearable running from one room to another. Boring character backstory. Would've suited a 6 part show.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"You end up hoping your favourite characters survives and there's some you hope get eaten.  Lots of unexpected deaths and you never know who's next.  The zombie aspect is done well with good cinematography. There's some truly sad deaths and it's worse when the situation could have been avoided so you feel for the other people.  If you want to watch a thrilling zombie movie, with likeable characters and one's you root for to get bit next, you'll like this."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"The first thing that struck me about ""All of Us Are Dead"" was its visually stunning cinematography. The dark and eerie atmosphere created by the deserted school hallways and dilapidated classrooms intensifies the sense of isolation and terror. The production team's attention to detail in portraying the gruesome makeup and practical effects for the zombies is commendable and adds a realistic touch to the horror elements.  The cast's performances were commendable, especially considering the young age of most of the actors. The characters are diverse and multi-dimensional, each carrying their own baggage and emotional arcs. The main protagonist, Nam Ra, played by Yoon Chan-young, delivers a standout performance, convincingly portraying a conflicted and scared teenager who transforms into a brave and resilient survivor as the series progresses.  What sets ""All of Us Are Dead"" apart is its ability to intertwine coming-of-age themes with the horror genre seamlessly. The series delves into the students' relationships, friendships, and secrets, giving depth to the narrative and making it more relatable to the audience. As the characters face the perils of the undead, they also confront their insecurities and grow in unexpected ways, creating a captivating emotional journey.  Additionally, the show's pacing is generally well-managed, with each episode leaving you eager for the next. However, some episodes felt a bit dragged down by excessive melodrama, leading to a slight dip in tension. Nonetheless, the thrilling zombie encounters and character-driven storytelling keep the audience invested in the unfolding events.  On the downside, the series could have explored the origin of the outbreak and its wider implications further. A few unanswered questions left me wanting more context on how the epidemic began and how it affected the world beyond the school's confines.  In conclusion, ""All of Us Are Dead"" is a must-watch for fans of the zombie genre and those who appreciate character-driven dramas. Its unique approach to the undead apocalypse and its focus on the personal struggles of the characters set it apart from conventional zombie shows. Despite a few minor flaws, this Korean series delivers a thrilling and emotional rollercoaster that will keep you engaged until the very end."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"Why oh why do Netflix insist on dragging shows out and ruining them? The first few episodes were great, the zombies very well done, and the pace kept my attention. Acting from all the cast excellent and quality writing and production.  Just by the end I was bored and felt like I was watching the same episode for four hours. Would have been so much better to tighten the editing and have half the episodes. Don't know if I'll watch the second series but I'd def watch the movie!"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,5,,"This show has all the check-marks you'd expect from a fairly high budget show.  And yet, it all falls completely flat as it tries to present a gruesome horror setting, combined with corny and comedic anime-like characters and situation handling.  It's watchable from start to finish ... but you really need to turn your brain off ... almost to the point like a zombie at at least half of it ...  Some episodes are bloated by either dragged out scenes or by repetition. Watching someone turn for the 6th time, in the same dramatic way, without previously building an emotional connection to those characters is played out by the 3rd episode.  Most of the situations are handled borderline moronic, and the consistency of the plot is reminiscent of a wet fart.  The worst of it was suffered by the dialog. It was either written by a computer, or a person who'd previously had very little social interaction with others.  If I'd have to come up with key-words that best describe the show, they would be: inconsistent, borderline comedic, dragged out and non-sensical.  I still can't decide if this was intended to be a comedy or a satire of the zombie genre, because it definitely can't be taken serious as horror/drama. And the show is self aware of what it's trying to do, as its characters reference the far better executed Train to Busan in more then once.  I'm aware that it's a zombie movie, so it's a ""turn your brain off"" kind of viewing, but this show puts absolutely no effort into trying to take itself serious even within it's own imaginary world.  This would have worked 100% better as an animated feature considering the cartoonish characters situation handling and presentation."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"This series is good when it comes to production and characters, and it really gives a glimpse of the type of human beings that will occur in such an apocalypse.  As a story ? Not the best to be honest. Two main reasons. The side story (the fathet) which did not really add so much value to the story and it felt like a waste. The second reason is that there is nothing special here, in Kingdom series or Rampant movie you see the touch of Koreans. However, in this there wasn't much.  Still Enjoyable and Watchable."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,Best zombie story ever.....the characters have played their role exceptionally and vfx+sound were on the next level Can't resist watching it again and again........eagerly waiting for SEASON -2............with the news that Cheong-San is ALIVE<3<3  Highly recommended for zombie lovers:)<3.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"I found this series quite interesting to watch with amazing graphics. The blood and zombie scenes are worth mentioning. Although the series gets boring at some times, and then exciting again, but over all I would say that it was worthy of my time, and you'll surely like it, if you're a zombie/blood/violence/thriller lover.  Ps.  I have also seen another drama, called Happiness (starring Park hyung Sik) personally, i liked it more, it has almost the same base of story, but the thing is, this series contains a hell lot of more emotions, which the above series is lacking. So yeah, DO WATCH IT TOO, i loved it!"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,6,,"This follows the well-known and highly successful Korean zombie movie formula that viewers have come to love. We mention here movies like Train to Busan, Peninsula, Kingdom and #Alive. Except for Kingdom, which is a series, all of these are feature films. In the case of Kingdom, the series succeeded in sustaining viewer interest all throughout.  All of Us are Dead starts in an exciting way with its fast-paced and taut script. But by the time you reach episode 5, the viewer loses interest. While the lull moments are opportune time for drama, dramatic scenes gradually become a distraction. The surprise ending of that episode involving Gwi-nam tries to put back the story on track, but it appears belated.  The young actors (Ji-hi Park, Yi-Hyun Cho, Park Solomon, Chang-young Yoon and In-soo Yoo) are competent. But a meandering story is the problem. At 12 episodes, the series is a bit too long."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"I really think it an excellent zombie TV series. On Douban, an app in China, used to comment on movies or TV series, etc, many people said that it is not so good, even a bad zombie TV series. I totally can't understand it. They think Onjo is too silly. They think the best choice for Onjo is to kill her best friend immediately after they found out that she was infected. I mean, they are just high school students, and she is Onjo's best friend. When the memories between them showed in Onjo' mind, I can't help crying. She was used to be my best friend. How could she be infected??!! I think what Onjo acted is realistic. That's what a normal people would do at that situation, and not just kill her without mercy. So I am quite disappointed about the rate on Douban, just 6.3/10. However, the rate on imdb makes me realize that there are people who use their brain to watch this TV series."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"I'm a sucker for these zombie movies and shows. They always manage to pull me into watching it. Korea somehow manages to make zombies more interesting compared to western movies and shows. For example, Train to Busan was absolutely stellar. My hope was that this show was on the level of that movie. The premise is ""Set in the South Korean city of Hyosan, things go berserk one day when a girl in the Hyosan High School is bitten by a rat infected by a deadly virus that turns happy humans into devastatingly ugly and ever-hungry human eating machines"". So does Korea deliver another excellent zombie action or is it a big miss?  Let's get the obvious out of the way first, the zombie action is indeed exciting to watch. There are some exciting and creative sequences in this show such as the dining hall sequence which is filmed like one shot. There are some other creative sequences such as one involving a fight between two individuals on top of bookcases while zombies are underneath. Another is where the characters build a giant wall to hold off zombies while they escape the other way. Another is where they create a circular wall while getting from point A to B. All these sequences feel very original and I certainly enjoyed watching them. I also have to give a lot of praise to the makeup artist as the zombies look frighteningly good. The zombie actors also do a good job as well in making them feel inhuman and unnatural. The zombies here are definitely quite scary and that is quite a feat considering how oversaturated zombies are in media.  The actors all do a phenomenal job in their portrayal. They all manage to give their characters distinct personalities even if they are just minor characters. The actors who die and become zombies also do a great job as zombies. The story is also quite engaging despite just being mostly about surviving. The story focuses on the dynamic and relationship of the surviving school students. We see them work together but also argue and fight but it never feels over the top or anything. What the story does the best is in delivering on the emotions and there is definitely some emotional stuff. We also got a more interesting origin for the virus that is also quite sympathetic and we got some special zombies that give the situation more spice to it. They also spend a fair amount of time with the military in the series to give the audience an understanding of their response to the virus. There is also quite a bit of romance in this and it surprisingly works well despite the situation not being the exact best for this.  However, there is a lot of characters in this show and honestly maybe too many. The show doesn't just focus on one group of survivors and instead multiple groups which lead to a lot of characters to pay attention to. What can be annoying is that a fair amount of these characters have nothing interesting to them but the series still spends a fair amount of time on them. If a character doesn't have an interesting backstory or personality then they are probably going to die which results in predictable deaths. There are also some characters that are just in the series for no reason such as a streamer that I felt added nothing to the plot apart from taking screen time away from actual interesting characters. Additionally, there are so many moments in this series where a character makes a really stupid decision that is frustrating to watch. Also, the characters not going for the head is a big annoyance. It also gets annoying when some characters stand around instead of helping their friend who is being attacked.  The series is also a bit too long and can feel a bit exhausting to watch. It is 12 episodes but after watching, it definitely felt like the series could at least be cut down by 2 episodes. There is a lot of sequences where it does just feel like they are padding for time. For example, we will have scenes where we watch characters stand around or just building and not talking or a scene where they share chocolate and it all feels too long and pointless. There is a ""villain"" in the show and that person is WAY too overused and gets defeated in the same way like 4 times, to the point that it is kind of laughable. There are also some potentially interesting plot lines that they could've explored but it is never utilized or explored. There are also some characters that just die for shock value which sucks as it feels like the show would be more interesting if they were kept alive.  Overall, All of Us Are Dead is a thrilling and exciting zombie show that unfortunately stumbles on all the subplots created. I did come out a little disappointed that they didn't utilize everything the show introduced effectively but it was still a really good time. It does end with a potential tease for season 2 and it might resolve some of the remaining plot threads from season 1. The ending is also quite interesting and it does make me wonder what direction they could go in. Thus I am hopeful for a season 2 despite the show's shortcomings."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,5,,"Good premises of a zombie apocalypse setup. Generally good acting but the whole coming-of-age mixed in really dragged down the show.  It's zombie apocalypse we do not have time for young brats' love quarrel and other emotional stupidity. Many parts we fast-forwaded to skip the boring cheesy moment that are suppose to be emotional. They felt completely out of place. Lot of sub-plots were not done in enough details and felt like just fillers.  And I meant it is a zombie apocalypse show we are not expecting it to be 100% realistic, but when you have the main casts happily chatting with each other after two-three days of no water and food, zombies suddenly chase flare for no reason, and certain roles took forever to fully turn into zombie after being bitten, you know something is wrong about the script."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"I had hear good things about this show but put it off because I grew sick of zombie shows and movies all basically being the same as each other. I got bored and decided to watch the trailer and it grab my attention because it seemed like it was super stereotypical zombie trailer, so I decided to give it a chance and watch one episode and then it turned into 2 episodes and then I couldn't stop watching.  It's truely different, there is great character development, a great story (a non-generic zombie outbreak scenario or an outbreak that just pops up out from nowhere {like the walking dead}), the show doesn't kill off characters just because they can or to add shock value (like the walking dead) and it's filmed perfectly with the right camera angles and the flow of the gram frames when filming the action scenes and suspense scenes and really every scene is something you don't really find in other zombie shows and movies.  Everything grabs your attention and keeps you hooked, so if you're sick of generic zombie shows/movies (or feel a little burnt out after the walking dead and are hesitant about watching a new zombie show) I would definitely recommend this one."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"If you're a fan of zombie genre then you would find it to be better than most of the existing Zombie based TV series/movies but the concept is predictable. There are few loopholes that are visible to the naked eye but still the production value makes up to it. Some of the characters are too shallow and they could've trimmed it to 10 episodes as 12 episodes felt a bit lengthy. Other than that, it's worth a watch."

지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"Finished the entire series in one sitting because of the way they wrapped up each episode with a hook.  It's amazing how Koreans are changing the face of the television and movie industry by introducing fresh content everytime. Just when we thought that almost every zombie idea has been fleshed out, along comes All of us are dead. Now it makes me want to check the manga."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,3,,"I didn't have any expectations.  Concept has nothing new. That's not a problem, a classic story can be very satisfying when executed properly. Think about Pocahontas and Avatar for example. All of Us Are Dead is a mixture of high school drama and graphic zombie gore. It would be good for kids, but the gore frames out the younger audiences. Therefore there's no audience left for this bungle.  Gore is used excessively, that might appeal to some audiences. If you enjoy gore and don't care much about anything else, this might be for you. Acting is steady. Usually it's hard to distinguish between bad acting and idiotic character. I believe the series includes plenty of both. Viewer might find depth from characters if he is keen to teen school series. There's nothing more, only sweepy and sketchy moral themes. It's very flat.  Nothing really happens in this series. Bunch of flawless looking kids run around in few locations ""surviving"" nearly invulnerably, without any problems such as starvation. The plot seems to be as stuck as the kids in every room they happen to find. Somehow the kids always manage to escape, since the zombies change their functioning according to scene, but the plot stays stuck. There's nothing wrong zombies being stupid. The problem is that the zombie's wit changes dramatically depending on the scene. Sometimes they have excellent pathfinding skills, sometimes they just push straight ahead.  Decisions the characters make are ridiculous. A character who is able to escape high security area and withstand and escape national special forces finds it impossible to climb a fence, that many of us have climbed in our childhood, and rather gives up and dies. That's when I found this series is nearly pure excrement.  With that budget, it's very sad they produced such a pile of garbage. Knowing that makes it even more frustrating to watch."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"I had a high hope that this could be next ""Kingdom"" or ""Train to Busan"" but unfortunately it's not.

I wasn't really feeling it after the first couple episodes (maybe 6 stars), but as the characters and story developed it got significantly better. I was hooked by the end of it. Would have probably given it an 8 had it started as strongly as it finished, so I'm splitting the difference with a 7."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"''All of us are dead'' is one of those productions that made me feel sorry that there was no next season.  The plot, atmosphere, action, and cast are only some of the advantages, and there are many more. I actually laughed so many times because of the sarcasm that is visible. Although this does not mean that the series is frivolous. On the contrary, there were plenty of twists and emotions. In short, from the first to the last episode I was fully engaged. Very interesting characters, music and several plot lines make you want more. It keeps the level practically the whole time and is not boring at all. I'm looking forward to the next season and I hope it doesn't end soon."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"Just when I thought I'd lost my appetite for Zombies, this gem of a series turns up on Netflix. For me it ticks all the boxes, I like the story behind how the virus was created. As you should, I liked and disliked the main characters in equal measure. There were enough perilous situations to keep me entertained and characters were killed off on a regular basis. As always with the Korean shows, they managed to bring some originality to proceedings. So it's a solid 8 from me."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"The zombie genre has long established itself as a staple in both film and television, and this series follows in those well-worn footsteps. While the show may not break any major new ground, it delivers a solid entry in the genre with competent acting, effective themes, and a familiar but engaging storyline. That said, viewers may find themselves divided-some appreciating its consistency and execution, while others might feel it suffers from repetition and predictability.  One of the stronger aspects of the series lies in the performances of its cast. The actors are undoubtedly talented, and they carry the emotional weight of the show convincingly. Whether it's the fear of being hunted, the heartbreak of loss, or the desperation of survival, the cast delivers these moments with skill. However, despite their commendable work, some episodes do tend to drag on. The pacing at times feels unnecessarily slow, stretching simple developments into entire episodes. This can test the patience of viewers who crave a faster-moving plot or more significant events to occur in each installment."

It isn't as gory as some zombie films, if that's what you are looking for. But the character development was fantastic.  The series had great pacing, brilliant performances especially from the young cast, and I haven't been able to lose myself in a series like this since G. O. T.  Well worth a watch."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"Since I love the zombie genre and South Korean zombie shows (i.e. Train to Busan, Kingdom, etc) I knew I was gonna give this one a try. If you love guts, blood, and gore I can say this show has plenty of it! If you like whiny teens that make absurd decisions, well, unfortunately this show has plenty of that too! The premise is not unlike other types of zombie shows. A virus gets out and there starts the zombie outbreak. At least with this series, you know pretty much from the beginning how it started and then the why it started develops as things move along. I will say things get tedious when episodes end up with the same scenarios and stuff, so in my opinion, this series could have easily been 9 or 10 episodes instead of 12. Luckily, when the tedious parts occur or the whinny teens start up, the fast forward button comes in handy! The teens, and even adults, make the dumbest decisions in many cases. But, I guess that comes with the territory in all zombie shows and movies. The ending leaves the door wide open for a second season, but I don't know how far they can take the idea of the ""different"" zombies (don't wanna give anything away, but it's a premise we have seen before.) All in all, mostly entertaining with a few down time moments. If you like this genre and like Korean movies/tv shows, give this one a try. And please use the original language and subtitles. Way better that way!"

The reason for the start of the pandemic was well thought out and it gave a good start to the story. A few of the episodes probably weren't necessary and filled the series out longer than it probably should have been.  If you like Zombies with a small touch of humour in places then check this out and don't take it too seriously, like most Zombie fodder it's best to not use your brain too much."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"Big fan of zombies and gores. This is not an exception. Love the idea of involving teenagers and school. Not heavily depends on the comedy like every korean series, which was a great choice. Anything on politics for me is a turn off, so -1 star. Great line of casts, amazing make up and costumes. Great scenery and amazing camera works, great sound effects. It gets messy on explaining about the virus origin and how the director handled some amazing characters just by killing them off (-1). Tbh too many characters, so lack focus. Totally not a fan of the ending, changing it from a zombie apocalypse survival series to a zombie hunting superhero series. (-1) Though the actions were pretty dope. Recommended."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"I already watched lots of zombie series like the walking dead, kingdom, etc but this series 1 level up from all other zombie series .  It has most scary and brutal zombie chasing scenes.  Character buildup is great . The story hooks you from 1st episode to last .  It has 0 boring moments.  You have to watch it once in a lifetime.  Highly recommended 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"This show had me hooked immediately from the trailer. As an enthusiast of the Korean zombie movie ""Train to Busan"" the reference made in the trailer peeked my interest immediately, and the show did not disappoint. From the characters, acting, writing, and camera work was phenomenal. This show made an incredible modern take on the typical horror trope and tying it in with the pressuring education system in Korea. Whilst capturing high school dynamics. It is engaging, thrilling, tear jerking, and funny. If you're a fan of other Korean zombie movies and shows I highly recommend this series!"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"I really enjoyed this for the most part - there's a lot of originality in a theme that's been done a lot, the acting was often good, the action sequences amazing, but then there'll be a really crap line, or some insanely dumb decision that makes you cringe.  I'd probably have rated it a little lower for those negatives, but hey, I live in the UK, so I'm well aware how dumb some decisions can be in real life, so they're not unrealistic, just a bit annoying."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,I was Keep On Postponing to watch this Series because of some Negative Reviews in IMDB .  Today I Simply Watched Episode 1 .  I couldn't resist to watch Other Episodes.  Reality Totally Binge worthy Show.  Completed Whole 12 Episodes in One Day.  Amazing Character Building.  Zombie Scenes are So Scary.  Ending Could have been More better.  Waiting for Season 2.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,6,,"It started out nice. But then... firstly, I would cut the number of episodes down to just 8. And one episode should be 45 minutes long, max. The cinematography was great, Koreans are masters in this stuff. But what in the hell were the dialogues about? I'll tell you: absolutely nothing! I watched the version with Korean audio and English subtitles so MAYBE a lot got lost in the translation? But still... it was painful to watch. It went on and on and on... was it a zombie horror? Teen drama? None. It was like creators couldn't decide."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,Nice series its not prefect 10/10 its like 9/10 in my opinion if u wana a 10/10 korean series?  U should watch series like  Flower of evil  Goblin  Crash Landing on You  my dangerous wife.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"It contains many issues that Korea has. I couldn't stop thinking about Sewol Ferry when kids were not saved by their own country and it broke my heart. I think the plot is great but it could have been much better with writing, acting and editing."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,3,,"I'm a huge fan of the zombies genre and this is was just horrible. It had so much potential, it could've been another Battle Royale theme but with zombies. I guess we got spoiled with Kingdom and Train to Busan. As mentioned in the other reviews, the dialogue drags and it doesn't go anywhere. The kids were so annoying I was literally hoping they would all die so the series would end. The worse is when they all just stand there while watching their friends get killed or watching one of them fight off a slew of zombies. Poorly developed storylines and characters. I can't believe there are 12 episodes to this disappointing mess. I stopped in the middle of 5 and I should've cut my losses after 2."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,This is a fantastic zombie series .  So season 2 release as soon as.  Cinematography is very brutal .  I think this is most popular series in the World next Few seasons .
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"Be warned, this is real tear-jerker.  I want to keep it short. To me, All of Us are Dead is a great example of pacing for the series. While not all the characters were equally fleshed out, however, they all were flawed in their own ways & very likable, just bear in mind the typical Asian pauses as characters think & express their emotions.  For me, the story telling is all about the characters, the pacing & build-ups. All of us are Dead moved me to like the characters, root for them & shed a tear when they start losing hope & the drama their-from."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"No doubt it's completely captivating series, Actions are endeavour which made seems like the real one, even sometime i get into the role of being infected😀😀..  Each episode gives high thriller on every moment and keep it in suspension at the end😃 .  But whole series goes around virus were made by a school teacher then spread outside since then its being multiplied and ends up ruining whole centers and vicinity to finish zombies..  Since zombie movies are all about it but i expect along with it, its end should be morally conclusive, that was missing.  Only recommended to the one who loves watching zombie/monster/Beast movies..  Lastly Love for Nomra🤗"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,My family and I really enjoyed this show. It was good from start to finish! Better than stupid Walking Dead that dragged on for years. Make a good series and know when to end it.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,6,,"Despite the superficiality and the aesthetics, direction and script (sometimes) of a soap opera, ""All of Us Are Dead"" has a very interesting beginning and is a strangely good experience. The 1st episode with the ending showing the beginning of the zombie apocalypse is wonderful. The zombie and Asian school combo works very well and is something I definitely wanted to see in live action since I watched the anime ""Highschool of the Dead"". Although the work is not Japanese, the vibe is certainly very similar. There is something wonderful in seeing young people in a school surviving a zombie apocalypse, and that is exactly what ""All of Us Are Dead"" offers. Something that bothered me a little is the moderate gore, it is always a bit disappointing to see a work with zombies having moderate gore, probably because of the soap opera-like air that the series has. Despite all the problems, the series is decent, and it is certainly a full plate for zombie fans and fans of Asian culture."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"From start to finish I lived the fact that anyone could die anytime throughout the series, I heard nothing about the series and watched it all in 2 days. Please let season 2 be just as good."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,6,,"I love zombie movies and series! And I was so excited to watch all of us are dead, but unfortunately I ended up very disappointed. The very first thing that happened is they mocked Christianity, and as a Christian it doesn't feel very nice, but I decided to give it another chance. I continue and it gets pretty exciting. But I started to get frustrated, the characters keep making stupid decisions, they are so slow to action, and continues to fall ALL THE TIME, even when there is no reason to fall. It's okey one or two times but after a couple of times it just gets tiring. If you love zombie movies like me, you should watch it just for the sake of watching it, I meaning they did a good job and the zombies are fast and threatening, but don't expect the best show of all time."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"I'm more of a movie person. Sit down for two hours. Enjoy. Move on. I have a hard time getting into series material. Stranger Things, Game of Thrones, and Squid Game are just a few that landed with me, but should that really come as a surprise. On the other hand, Yellowstone, Breaking Bad, and Ozark did not hook me. The point being, I can be a hard sell when it comes to series material.  All of Us Are Dead was the most recent series that I took a chance on. With all of the zombie based material out there, I had reservations, and really only jumped in based on its high rating. As of writing this, I only have the last episode to watch. This series has managed to get better with every episode. I heard one reviewer suggest that its too long and could have cut some subplots or character interactions. I disagree. Everything going on here only serves the development of something bigger. The dialogues are all needed to base and give depth to the characters. I came to care for almost every character, good or bad.  I also had thought, at first glance, that the dialogue between the students was clumsy and generic. On second thought, its probably closer to how teens talk to each other than is usually presented in film and television. The tension is present and done well. The students drive to survive coupled by their shortcomings in doing so, whether because of age, stature, experience, or resources, seems fairly real.  These episodes hit a little harder with each one.  If you're reading this as a consideration to start the series, I would say go for it.  If you're reading this as a consideration to continue the series, I would say stay with it.  I am usually jaded with whatever I watch. Few movies or series play with my emotions anymore. Episodes 10 and 11 are butt kickers. If you can manage to be invested in the characters, any of them, these two episodes will affect you.  I can't wait to see how this wraps up. One to go."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"Going into it i was really not sceptical as the series was 12 episodes (each episode having 45+ runtime), and the series does lag in the middle but at the end its a good series. Acting is not bad , zombies are part we seen before and part new things. Worth a watch go for it if you have time. After watching this i really miss the series named ' Sweet Home ' which i hope Netflix renews for a new season ."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,1,,"This series has been pulled unnecessarily into 12 long bad episodes. Extremely slow, and cliche acting and storyline. Some of the actors are so bad, they literally have zero reaction even after seeing a zombie...lol. Does not live up to the over hyped trailers...sigh."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"Holy Cow!! What a blast!!! After I watched Squid Game a couple of months ago , I was mind blown by how much talent Koreans have. So when I heard about All of Us Are Dead I was really excited to see what they've got in store for us this time. And as expected I had an amazing time with this series. The pacing is well done , the characters are likable even if they sometimes make wierd decisions but let's be honest how can a group of high school students make proper decision when suddenly a zombie outbreak takes place in their school. At times it reminded me of Train To Busan meets Highschool Of The Dead. The zombies are animal like and way too fast just like in Train to Busan and the story takes place at a Highschool just like HOTD. However , I was a bit disappointed by the typical Netflix ending but that's my only criticism. Really enjoyed this series and would recommend to all the zombie lovers out there. It's proven that when it comes to Zombies no one can do it better than South Korea."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"All of Us are Dead, this South-Korean series is like Train to Busan, Happiness, and #Alive.  In my Opinion, This Series is really Amazing and this is the best Zombie Series I've watched so far! The effects, the CGI, the fighting scenes, it's really outstanding! With Great 12 episodes that's 1 hr long every single one of them, it's all.superb! Even if it's violence, gory and endless and nonstop assault of zombies on an team of students who luckily survive the quick first wave of the apocalypse, even if it's like that, this Series gives the audience a good and positive outcome at the end, it's a great Zombiecalypse Series!  The Writer, the Director and the Actors/Actress really worked hard for this Amazing Series! It's a 10-Star Rating, WORLD CLASS!!  Additional Note : We hope that this Series have Season 2, it would be really great and amazing."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"Koreans really know how to make a good zombie. These are the slow walking easy to survive ones, these are the ones that will test your cardio. You better hope it's up to the challenge."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"All in all it's got everything you could want from the Zombie genre, while still avoiding some of the more cliche tropes.  The characters get pretty good towards the later half of season 1, but early on they weren't all that interesting or likeable.  For some reason most characters were constantly bickering, and being class A a-holes to each other for no reason. This got better quickly though, as the characters had a little time to develop.  There seems to be a few inconsistencies so far, in who gets affected in what way by the virus, and why, but I expect that to be expanded upon in future seasons."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"I binge watched this entire 12 hours season over 2 days because I couldn't stop clicking next episode, every episode just keeps getting better. There were a few problems with music choices in scene, that took away some value, and the finale wasn't too great, but other than that, everything else was incredible."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"All Of Us Are Dead is a decent zombie series about a virus gone awry, turning the infected into zombies.  I love a good zombie show, especially when the zombies can run quite fast, rather than limp slowly. Much more exciting. And as the title suggests, there are a lot of deaths, so the threat is real and nailbiting.  There are some slight problems, however. The explanation of the origin of the virus is so so. There are some suspect decision-making given the life threatening situations. And during the middle of the series, the horror adds a mutant element that I'm still undecided about. And I wish there were way more jump scares. Finally, the drama is mostly between the high school characters.  Despite those points, it's definitely an above average zombie series."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,2,,There is no coherence whatsoever: zombie turning may go from seconds to several minutes depending on the character. The amount of stupid decisions and unrelatable characters get me siding with the zombies by the 2nd episode. Save yourself from this.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"I write my view after watching the whole series, and really really I love love this series all episodes are amazing Each an every character played a superb roll I request to director plz make the season 2 fast With old character I am waiting for this.love u whole team Fantastic series in my life."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"I liked the series. Especially viewing how Korean kids typically behave in their normal environment.  As to the zombies, they are pretty standard and the kids make the same moves as in most zombie flicks. Ex: staring for seconds too long before reacting, then jumping in to sacrifice themselves, etc Basically, what kids would likely NOT do.  But I still enjoyed it immensely. It's a fast paced energy thrill ride."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"Talking about the positives the series has good characters, story, suspence and a new type of zombies that can be called as half zombies. The show is suspenseful from beginning to the end and won't really bore you cause there are many interesting events that happen in each episode that makes you wanna watch the next episode. However the show is quite repetitive in terms of the zombie encounters and the way they deal with the zombies sometimes is both senseless and impractical. Also the show uses quite a few ""fake"" Encounters and incidents to lure the audience to the next episode. The climax of the show is good but it leaves a lot of questions that needs to be answered but at the same time it seems unnecessary to make another season just to answer those questions cause those questions aren't that interesting to make people wanna watch another season. Overall it's a good way to pass your free time."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"Pilot was very weak I must say But show picks up pace in completely contrasting fashion from second episode and depicts almost everything a lover for zombie shows wants.  But it's NOT for you if you can't stand Gore at all.  Well obviously you can't compare it to 'The Walking Dead' but they have done a very good job.  So if you love zombie shows, give it a shot one episode beyond the pilot."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"This series just feels so real, and everything happened in it can be convincingly happening in real life, this is what most zombie series are lack of. And another thing this series is good at is the action scenes, they really did a great job.  All characters in this drama is depicted well, with their distinct personalities, even those characters that only appeared once or twice. The main characters also got distinct personalities and each of the acted very well, that's what we need for a zombie drama, because a zombie drama without deep character development can be pure brainless entertainment with lot's of gore and violence only.  There're also shortcomings in this series, especially in mid sections of this drama, everything gets a little boring, however, the plot is getting more and more attractive as the plot goes on, and it can still hook audiences without much action scenes involved.  Overall, this series is a great zombie series with great action scenes, and a decent plot with deep character development, it's a zombie series with good production value."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"'All of us are dead' is the latest Korean sitting on top in Netflix shows which have been dominated by Koreans for a couple of months in most countries. Whether you are familiar with K-drama or you are just getting to know about it after the #squidgame pandemic and giving it a chance just like me, this show has so much to tell. The plot is not perfect and has a lot of holes in it that some of it will be probably answered in next season, however, for someone with a lot of Zombie movies, shows, and games experience, the characters seemed a bit stupid at the start, some of the deaths are badly written. But when you stop comparing them to let's say badass characters of other shows like #Thewalkingdead, they seem a lot more realistic. So bear that in mind that these characters are just a bunch of high school kids with no experience or proper weapon at hand. The story starts with a virus outbreak in a high school and covers a lot of different characters without a leading role. With all the explanations 'All of us are dead' has a messy but proper and thrilling plot. The casting is good. I believe that most of the actors & actresses are new faces but they did the job quite well. CG and computer effects are good mostly but in a few scenes, it's not very clean. The soundtracks and sound effects are good and it brings a sense of fear to the show. The opening is one of the positive points and it's innovative.  Overall, 'all of us are dead' is a brutal and thrilling zombie show with an acceptable plot and good choice of cast. If you are looking for a fun zombie show that tastes like K-drama, it can be a good choice for you."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,1,,"The series is really disappointing. It's cliche with borderline cringy lines. It has inferior characters, with plenty of unnecessary scenes.

지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"I am 22 years old. I grew up with Dawn of the Dead, and I must say, this show is far better. It's like taking a bland dish and adding the right spices to it to make an even better dish; sorry DOTD fans, I still love DOTD, but it's no longer my favorite apocalypse film; it will go down in history as the best of it's time.  I am a huge fan of the Beastars. Just an FYI, I know that this film takes place in Korea while the Beastars Netflix Series takes place in Japan, but the High School setting; the mystery theme of who or what is behind a killing, the character's voices/mannerisms and even their uniform remind me of the Beastars; the hero dude Cheogsan who has a secret crush on Onjo reminds me of Legoshi and Haru for instance.  This is hands down the BEST zombie-apocalypse movie-series of all time. I call it a movie series because the episodes are like movie segments, that really don't feel like they're a hour long. It's absolutely hilarious too. I've so far watched 3 episodes. I would hate to spoil it for those who want to see a Sci-Fi masterpiece that still managed to be original. The character arcs are gripping, and you grow an attachment to the main characters really quickly.  Since it's full of gore, I'd say it's best fit for ages 17 and up.  In many ways, the zombie-virus reminds me of COVID, but is way worse than covid; Contagion's virus was eerily just like coronavirus too, but again not as terrifying as the one on this show. Made me think, ""Maybe Covid isn't so bad,"" and the importance of our modern-day technology!  The animation is intense, so-much-so that you forget this is just a movie. If you watch it long enough, you actually start to feel there; the makeup and animation is simply so compelling. Immediately, when you begin to watch it, you're HOOKED. You'll feel empathy, fear, suspense, and amusement AT ONCE. Every single character on here is interesting and talented; both the actors on the screen, and the voice-over actors; you can't even tell that it's a voice over, and I really had to study their lip movements, which still seem to be in sync; you seriously WON'T notice it very much at all.  You'll be determined to see what happens to all of them, and if they make it out because the title itself just draws people in. It is brilliant. Every single shot and angle is perfectly paced in line with the story. I never feel like characters stall or are dragging the time, like I've seen with even some Disney+ Originals; move aside Disney and take some notes, because Netflix Originals did it AGAIN with another masterpiece.  It is bound to jerk some tears of sadness or shock, or make you cry laughing. You seriously can't get bored with this one - even I can't and I am attention-deficient. This is definitely binge-watchable if you can stomach the realisticness of the gore and suspense. Sometimes I even forgot that the characters can't hear me through the screen when they're unbeknowst of a zombie's approaching. I can see why this made the top 10, but this baby could go in a top 3 tier list. I have yet to find something that comes as close to it!"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"I am a fan of zombie movies and series... you name it and probably I have seen it... Korean zombie concept is always high impact fast moving ones and this one was no exception to ""Kingdom"" or ""Train to Busan.  Having said that, this series doesn't deliver anything more than an average story. Originality of virus unclear, acting mediocre, ending typical. Tries to introduce some novel concept like ""intelligent zombie"" but could have been better.  But still I gave 7/10 just because the plot was better executed than many other zombie series... a good one time watch probably. Notjing more."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"At first, it seemed boring, but it became more fun toward the second half. I watched it all in three days. It can be said to be the best zombie series. I hope season 2 comes out soon."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,Some scenes are extraordinary awesome but they gave some superhuman type powers to some zombies which was kinda unacceptable. The ending part was way too boring and overall it is good...
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"I wanted to watch this series for a very long time but resisted myself because I know that South Korean thriller series' are generally hideous, hopeless and hollow. However, these kind of series are a kind of guilty sorrow for me. I had to watch it.  I am quite impressed, I should say. It is like an anime. 2D characters, all stuck in this unbelievable action flick, everyone wanting to survive but most die. Start watching it with less expectations, you will really get to like it.  As I said before, it is an anime kind of film cent percent. So, expect things to go berserk and OP. If you love such kind of films/series, go watch it now. You won't regret!"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"It made me feel that it was something really fresh from the genre.  Before delving into why I thought it was good, let's stop for a second to remove the basic prejudice about zombie movies.  A lot of people are saying it's yet the old zombie trope and same old thing again. ""Characters trying to survive and dying one by one."" But I don't think it is fair to compare or judge it that way.  It's like saying oh this action movie is about characters fighting, then other action movies including characters fighting cannot be good. Or this drama is about a character's life story then other dramas about other characters lives' story is not innovative because both are telling life stories about a character.  I am a huge zombie fan, and have watch most of the zombie shows/movies.  Obviously the premise is the normal zombie premise but what made the show differentiate from the rest, is the other elements added into it such as character depths, morals, love, hope, hate and friendship. There are characters that will make you laugh, cheer for, like, hate and also get annoyed at. Which in itself is a success because it made you feel that way.  It also had twist and turns that are not used in many other zombie flicks. And I have to say as an avid zombie veteran, I was taken by surprise more than a handful of scenes. (Which is not easy at all since I have seen most of them.) And if it managed to make you immediately want to click on the next episode to see what happens next, it has also succeeded.  Yes, it got it's bad moments sometimes, can be slow, stupid decisions are made and also a few plot holes. But those are forgiven in the grander scheme of things. The cinematography was beautiful, zombies really well made, acting was amazing by such young actors and action sequences realistically done. And again, in this ""overdone"" genre it managed to be fresh from the rest and made me think about it after the credits were rolling. For a zombie series, it deserved a 10 for me."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,6,,"If you watch alot of korean movies, the thing that you will notice is the many nonsense talking, long dialogues and lame arguments. They even talk to themselves. Imagine if they remove all that this could be just 6-7 episodes  Expect this on this series 1. Too much dialogues 2. A very stupid decisions by the characters that even stupid people doesn't decide like that 3. But the cinematography is great, the lighting and effects 4. The lighting especially on a night scene is a top notch for me, you can still clearly see what's happening  Overall this is a above average series. Just don't expect it to be on the same level as The Walking Dead."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,4,,"I'm amazed how many of you are saying that is a great zombie idea.  I'll tell you is NOT.  First episode started well and then when infection strikes all of the students started to play too dumb, their reaction is not realistic at all, when you see zombies coming to you, you simply run like hell not playing around the zombie crowd  After 5 minutes of second episode I said NO. It' not worth my time."

지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"As an avid zombie fan I put this in my top 5 best zombie shows / movies of all time. The acting from the zombies is phenomenal. It's realistic feeling, blood everywhere, bodies slamming every which way exactly like it would be if this were real life. I have wondered in several scenes whether anyone actually got hurt, I mean they go HARD. Could the dubbing be better - of course, I'm yet to see a dubbed show or movie that couldn't have been better however this is the best I've seen yet. I can only hope they make more like this."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,This show is entertaining but full of completely nonsense and absurd choices by the characters. Things no one ever would do if they were in that situation. I almost stopped watching when 2 characters decide to have an emotional conversation as the zombies are seconds away from getting in the room.  It's things like that that kill the feeling of urgency of a show.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"It's unsurprising that another excellent show tackling the zombie genre has tumbled out of South Korea, yet again showing us that the undead category is still alive and kicking.  I can sing this shows praises to the moon and back with truly excellent camerawork focusing on complex wide sweeping shots condensing down into close ups all in one take, not to mention a clearly competent directorial team on deck. The setting is, although fairly overdone in zombie media (a high school), showcased to us in a fairly fresh and interesting way, with plenty of background building before the main outbreak occurs and a very in depth look at the good and bad already occurring at the school.  That being said I absolutely need to address the few issues this show has sadly, they aren't small. While the acting is decent enough to not ruin the immersion, actually on the contrary it ranges from decent to fantastic, the stupidity that runs rampant absolutely is. Characters suffer from the zombie flick stereotype of suddenly forgetting all common sense until it is absolutely crucial, survivors have to be taught the absolute basics of survival despite stating several times that they've seen zombie movies, they reference Train to Busan for gods sakes but don't know how to push a table against a door until a teacher arrives?  It's also a shame that one of this shows greatest strengths also becomes its greatest weakness, as it's ability to jump between separate survivor groups is seamless and anticipated, it is also annoying at times and very much unnecessary. Without going into detail there are entire character arcs pushed in to the already overcrowded narrative who don't contribute to the story and serve no purpose to anything other than a small emotional hit to the viewer. That's all. Unnecessary and very annoying to watch. It also must be said that the animation, a thankfully minor part of the mostly prop/makeup based effects, is laughably bad. Luckily it is only used sparingly.  Overall, however, I am thrilled at the end results and despite the aforementioned issues, I can't wait to bite into more. Hopefully season 2 will be just as frantic and exciting!"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,That girl in the white hoodie took my nerves.  So annoying af ngl I nearly quit that show so annoying this girl was. Who cast her ? Real question WHO ? Was that guy on some pills or something ?
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"I did noy expect this movie to be very good but it did surprise me in many ways. Definitely its the best zombie movie right now.  It has pretty much everything - good evolving story, zombies, kids, love stories and politicians, nice cliff hangers in each episode etc."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,7,,"A different kind of zombie story with good actors and lots of goore, but suffers from inconsistence wrighting.  Interesting plot, realistic science and creative tactics.  Stupid characters, ridiculous logical decisions and lots of plot holes.  All in all a show i recommend to watch, if you can stand people screaming all the time while still trying to hide from flesheating zombies attracted to sound."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,4,,Started promising but I would have switched off after episode 4 if it wasn't for my partner who wanted to finish it.  Turns out we needn't have bothered. There must have been 3-4 episodes where nothing happens and they just move about from room to room making the same mistakes. Infuriating.  Zero payoff at the end too.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"This is easily the best Korean drama I've ever seen. The action is sustained, well-paced and highly engaging, the stunt choreography is arguably the best I've seen across any genre, any country, and the acting and script are top notch. It avoids the repetitive and expositional motifs of a lot of Korean tv, doesn't have any significant filler and manages to keep saccharine moments to a minimum for what is mainly a high school horror drama. The episodes fly by despite being either side of an hour in length, and while I would love a 2nd series, it sits perfectly as a stand-alone. The zombies are scary and amusing at the same time, it has mastered Korean tv's knack for intrinsic comic timing, and the villains are genuinely intimidating. Also the best zombie tv show I've ever seen, tonally it's more 28 Days Later than the Walking Dead (thank god). 100/10, would recommend."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"I have to admit, the first 15 minutes didn't grab me. However, I stuck with it and it's turned out to be one of my best series I have ever watched. The young actors and actresses were amazing. The storyline played out every sort of emotion. Even though each episode lasted around an hour, we ended up watching four episodes back-to-back as we were SO hooked. Utterly brilliant and a great ending."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"This was a massively will done show, the stories were good the effects were nice and the goriness was what you'd expect from a good zombie show.. Watch it and enjoy.. Well done 👍"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,1,,The plot is so fake like one moment they are just students and the second later they become super ninja letal killer Also the characters are all so stereotyped is annoying!
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"In the recent years Korean producers have been making good movies in the zombie sub-genre. Train to Busan, Netflix's Kingdom series etc and now: All of Us Are Dead. There are 2 points that I wanna raise here.  First things first, the zombie-actors are simply marvellous! Look at those kids!!! I think some are really recruited from kindergartens and they have excellent performances comparable to many adult actors/actresses. Pound for pound these kids can overshadow kids in Walking Dead series. No bias, but Koreans are catching up.  And secondly, it's the new concept. Precisely it's not exactly new or original, but it's rare in zom subgenre. Namely the ""asymptomatic"" zom. We've seen werewolves or vams or Hulk that can change form deliberately or casually or emotionally. But not always seen in zombies, yeah? I like this concept. Cool babe. It's makes the story much more intriguing. U never know the one sitting next to u is a norm or a zom.  What's not that good then? Well, the mad science teacher. Yeah I know he has a very special background but, hey, look at him. He's not convincing at all. I don't mean he's a bad actor, but he's not that ""crazy scientist"" in all aspects. When I come to my senses I don't even believe he has sufficient resources to make any significant accomplishment in cellular biology projects. No no no, not even an compelling argument.  As a conclusion, I love this series very much. Guys pls give it a shot. If u r a zom fan like me, ask your gal/guy to sleep first and then binge-watch it overnight. Worth your every minute ;)"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,Overall it was a good drama ...... tears flew from my eyes during all sacrifices......... the survival was epic... But it had too much of blood scene...
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,RIGHT NOW I CAN'T CONTROL MY EMOTIONS ....No words for this series.. ..only one word masterpiece... Especially i like the best scene is conversation between those friends in school roof top😭😭🔥  BTW too much violence.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,I can give up on my soul to watch this drama for the first time once again. This is one of the best show i have watched so far. And I really am waiting for a season 2. :((
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,5,,"With any zombie movie or drama, you accept the basic premise of a fictious life form that does things that are unreal. However, it does get frustrating when the show is filled with unrealistic human behavior. The zombie outbreak at the school starts with a girl opening a cage that was rattling. I had a sense of deja vu since another zombie show, Kingdom, had two people fighting to the death, but stopping suddenly to open a rattling crate, which let out the... zombie... Are there that many people in this world who cannot resist opening something that rattles? Please, please... If you hear suspicious rattling from a box or crate, call the authorities or move away from it. Do NOT open the damn box!!!"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"I am wating for season 2.  There are few on-screen situations more dread-inducing than watching a zombie outbreak in real time. Tracking a single infection as it grows exponentially and tears through an unwitting populace is an anxiety-riddled experience that's rarely easy to watch. ""All of Us are Dead,"" the latest Netflix drama to take a stab at a widespread cataclysmic event, announces itself in its opening episode by meticulously showing the transformation of a school. In a single afternoon, the massive Hyosan High School complex is plunged into chaos after one errant bite from a science lab test animal starts an irreversible chain reaction."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"I rate this show a 10/10 because it deserve a better ranking , and its the only zombie show that i like the most.  I felt really connected to the characters .  I had high hopes for this show and eventually im not disapointed."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"Think Freakish and Walking Dead: World Beyond with the frequent intensity of Train to Busan, but so much better than the first two. Even with some of the cliched relationships and instances, this still felt much more creatively original than the garbage that's come out of the US for the past decade."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,5,,"If you're a fan of zombie show and won't care about the quality/plot or any details - sure go for it.  Also if you're new to Korean shows and want to watch something go ahead However, if you're someone who watches shows for the plot, direction, cinematography, stunts then I'd say this one was so disappointing.  It looked great when the trailer was out. I was actually excited but the show is below average for me. The camera work was sloppy. Looks like it was shot way back in 2000 or the techniques they used were quite outdated not sure about that (still there were good shows with good quality before 2000s. So clearing that ) Background score is really not appropriate - it doesn't sync with most of the scenes. Usually Koreans shows have amazing OST's or background scores.  The plot is terrible - Same typical plot (both school/zombie) there's nothing new plus they tried to fit everything in the plot that it felt more of a school drama than zombie school drama This may be a low budget show but still I've seen better shows with low budget!  Anyway all I want to say is rather than watching this show and wasting time on it. Please watch Happiness (its of same genre but the plot is amazing - overall an epic show ) and thank me later 😋 This is coming from a person who watched countless number of Korean shows and is tired of basic plots - so don't be offended if you liked the show. Since, most of the reviews are misleading to someone like me I just wanted to put it out there."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,This is not just another spin off on the zombie genres. The Koreans have given it a twist and added lots of emotional elements to it. One can relate to each and every character in this series. I am shocked at the talent coming out of South Korea - how do they find such great actors? Each and every person has put so much effort and it shows throughout the 12 episodes. The scale is huge and Netflix has put lot of money in this. Please watch it straightaway if you haven't already.  Me and my wife are looking forward to season 2 already :)
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,This thing is actually pretty slow and boring until episode 3 then the pace really picks up and things start to get interesting. So if you are looking for quick action then skip to episode 3 or the middle of episode 2. I'm now at episode 6 and it's actually pretty interesting now.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"First things first, this series has insane amount of gore. So it's a warning, anyone who is sensitive or cannot tolerate gore should stay away from this series.  When I finished 2 episodes of this series I thought, ""what is new? It's that usual zombie survival series that Korea produces every year"". I felt it was like ALIVE but set in a school rather than apartment. Moving further into the series I realized, it is not usual.  Zombie survival series are always interesting no matter how old they become. Having watched so many zombie based films/series, I now find those snarling open mouthed zombies absolutely hilarious. Either they look disgusting or they look hilarious.  However, what makes this series so different from the other zombie ones are these:-  1. The fact that it deals with the mental state of the bullied school kids who get no help or comfort, like how Eu-Jin wishes the school burns down and everyone gets killed after her being bullied. This results in grave consequences later in this series watch out for that.  2. The fact that the zombie virus is justified this time. Most of the time we get only a faint detail of the infection but this time, through the videos of the professor, we get to witness a lot of details about the virus.  3. The fact that the makers have decided to introduce a new kind of zombie into the series which later turns into a grave danger for all.  There are many more new elements in this series and that's a huge plus point for a genre that normally doesn't get much different treatment.  Loopholes, quite a lot including some really illogical scenes that I could not help but scratch my head at those points and the fact that the series is unnecessarily stretched. Each episode is about more than an hour long (honestly, it is just 1 hr on average considering credits start playing with 5 mins left at end) and there are 12 episodes. You really feel the drag when the student gang talk and share their feelings amongst themselves on a rooftop and these were some parts I genuinely skipped.  Overall, I think the makers did a good job by introducing new unique elements into this zombie series otherwise I was ready to bash up this series left and right had it been that usual zombie survival series that are available in millions on Netflix."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"Once you get past the second episode it is absolutely amazing!! Episode one and two are too unrealistic. I understand it is just a tv show (it's not real life) but the characters emotions and actions are unrealistic to the point where you don't want to watch it. However, after episode one and two the show becomes absolutely amazing, addictive and enjoyable to watch. Although there are problems with the first 2 episodes I highly recommend everyone to watch this show. And I cannot wait for season 2!!!"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,1,,"Just your typical zombie movies like the ones in West, too much drama stupidity and no logic. They even say have you watch the movie Train to Busan? And still not learn anything from it, the police and soldiers aren't even using guns in the beginning episodes."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"Undoubtedly koreans are the best. The story contains everything. Friendship, love, humanity, thrill, adventure, fear, cruelty. What else we need. Could nt find any single flaw in this series. And also each and every scene is delightful to watch. Right from first scene its been a terrific making from koreans. We have to agree."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"Literally, best season i've watched on Netflix. The acting, production & all the side-actors are mind blown! WHAT A SERIES!! KUDOS to the team for making this masterpiece! Willing to watch Season 2."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,If you want crippling depression this show will give it for sure. It has fantastic writing which builds suspense and has meaningful characters. I would definitely watch this show with someone as it can get really intense. It is never hard to follow and has a solid plot. I enjoyed watching this show even though it did not end like I would have wanted.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"This would have to be the first Korean show I have watched... Thank GOD for English Dubs. I was expecting the same old, same old with Zombie shows, however I was pleasantly surprised by this one. This is not like American Zombie shows with slow moving rotting corpses that people just have fun blowing the brains out of. No, this show has Zombies that are fast and surprisingly some beings that are more like Alice out of Resident Evil. There was one character I did not like in the show, but that was because he played his part so well. I don't want to give to much away, so I'll just say I'm actually waiting for the second season of All of us are Dead. I got bored of walking dead during the first season so I think this says a lot for this show. I hope to see some more good acting from the cast and cannot wait to see how these new beings as I called them turn out. Give it a go!"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"Good. It is a Korean zombie film that subtly reveals the current reality of COVID-19 in Korea. The situation in Korea is shown well throughout the scene, so if you want to know about Korea, I recommend you watch this movie."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,As with all Korean shows there are things that have to be ignored if you're not Korean yourself like the main characters arguing over how a junior student in the school spoke to a senior one when there are Zombies trying to break down doors and kill everyone.  Moving on from that the show has very good production value and special effects are on par with anything else out there.  The characters are engaging and make you feel everything from happiness to sadness and everything in between. The show keeps you invested and you can never be sure who the next person to be killed will be. The cast is very good and fully engaged in what they do every min they are on the screen which in turn keeps you engaged as well.  The only criticism is that some episodes are somewhat samey and in effect become fillers. They show could be a minimum of 2 if not more episodes shorter and still have the same impact.  Final verdict is that while it's not by any means ambitious or life changing but in my humble opinion well worth watching.  I binged it over one weekend and quite a happy camper.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"After watching TWD FWD , Kingdom and then this and to be frank this had a vague origin story compared to others but what it did right was not waste time on dragging the story based on each cast for a recap which TWD does for a long long time. All of us are dead adds one important thing the evolution of virus and adding to varieties types of zombies which may or may not happen in the next season but they made the hype happen.  So 10/10 watch it."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"Very good Filmography, No unique topic though but let me tell u dat d writer is merciless,He srsly kills any body lmao ,but good story line not boring Like it....."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"Okay, first thing first, I'm not a fan of zombie movie or series AT ALL. But this show was still good and I was binge-watching and finished watching for 1.5days.  The plot was probably nothing special, but still well-made and enough to make me addicted. The story is combined with fear, teenagers love story, family love and some hint of resemblance of Covid-19 world."

All the ppl complaining and hating are brain dead like the zombies this show is SO GOOD and i definitely recommend watching it 10/10!!! The characters are amazing the plot is amazing, it may run a little slowly but that's nothing it is AMAZINGG please watch it you wont regret it.  The acting and characters are on point and so is the gore and makeup. It all comes together to make such a great zombie show, if you're looking for a zombie show with a great plot and actors all of us are dead is the one for you.. props to Korea for releasing this absolute banger of a show!"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,Who knew that a zombie outbreak would start at a high school in south Korea but I got to say it was full of action and suspense and drama etc I recommend this show to anyone 17+ if they are really mature p.s. Its very graphic.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,AOUAD is great zombie survival show though it borrows many elements from other manga's (like sweet home) and train to busan but it is really original. Forget high school of the dead thats pure echhi. But this is really thrilling survival horror show. Cinematography and direction is good. Zombies are scaries. Show isn't predictable and ending is not that good. Cliffhangers are bad but action makes it all for it. If you liked this i recommend read SWEET HOME webtoon. A must watch for people coming in zombie genre.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"I don't know what to say I'm speechless but this is a very amazing show love it. I love every part of it,I love the entire episodes so cool..👍 Hope in season 2 would be very scary! I'm excited.  Great show👍👍 keep it up."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"Honestly speaking , I thought this would be just a random zombie series that others usually do . But this one hits different . There are a few lags in between , yes but none of them matter coz that's what adds up to show . The start maybe a bit slow where the students hide in different rooms but after the 4th episode, I binged till the end. That's how the show keeps you hooked up . Kudos to everyone involved and thankyou for such an amazing experience."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,This was amazing! I actually enjoyed this series more than Squid Game! Everything was perfectly timed. A lot of the characters had development and grew throughout the series. Wonderful! Can't wait for season 2!

지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"It is a film that has found value enough to want to write a review despite having to use a translator.  Like a Korean drama, the sophisticated film technique and detail stood out.  What makes this film more valuable is that it tries to deal with the problems of human society.  It shows the gap between the rich and the poor among students in the school, bullying among students, and the selfishness of human beings through it.  In a situation where zombies spread throughout the city, the attitudes of each person involved also show the brutality and dignity of human beings at the same time.  I feel that this drama asks us a lot of philosophical questions and I want to give it a big score.  Through nonstop action, the eyes are not boring, the romance between students is well expressed, and the friendship between people move us.  I don't give it a full score because of the boring parts in between, but I recommend this drama."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,Zombie series with a very classic atmosphere and a very banal but still valid plot. In general the series is entertaining and at times has some very interesting twists and manages well to keep the tension. Many points are tragic and pay off. Too bad that after a while the series becomes a bit too monotonous because the protagonists run away and get stuck in a different point every time until the next episode and this thing in the long run a little tired.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,I've never seen before like this series. It's amazing show. I really love this series. The friendship the bonding the teamwork and the visual effects and acting. It's really appreciated.

I am eagerly waiting for season 2.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"I saw the trailer and was like ""It'll be ok"" cos I like the zombie genre and I think Train To Busan is the greatest zombie movie of all time. So I was looking forward to this show but with a very average expectation. So I watched the firsts episode and instantly got hooked. The introduced the characters well, friction between all of them was further developed even better as the show progresses. It is fun, thrilling and an entertaining show that had me binging deep into the night. 12 episode and I thought none felts boring. It is a very good show and worth it very much."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,3,,"Honestly, the trailer looked awesome but the show itself is absolutely disappointing! It's so slow, so much talking and too many plotlines that are not needed.  The gore was okay but could've been better. So many characters did not make sense, within a matter of minutes the virus has made half human and half zombie without there being a follow up on that.  Characters that should've had a big impact on the story end up being pointless. There is more time spent talking and sitting around a fire than there is zombies. They spend so much of the time running from room to room which could easily been avoided if they just secured the room.  The fact that too many characters are annoying and just do nothing for the story.  This show is bad. Really bad. I do not recommend."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"I loved the way the series handles school students facing everything from nasty bullying, true friendship, love to questions about life itself. What if you and your friend are hiding from the zombies, quietly in the restroom, and your friend begins to turn into a zombie, would you kill her? Would you let her eat you, because she cannot help herself?  I hope season 2 is made as well!!"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"This is actually my favourite zombie show after ftwd. Even the title is interesting, that's what brought me to the show and how I started watching it and with that I made othe best decision ever. I was a little sceptical at first but the first episode was when I realised how good and amazing it is. I literally love it so much, it's one of my comfort shows. I cannot even put it to words how much I love that show. I mean the characters are cool asf, the story, plot, how authentic and real it look cus it has a high budget. It's literally too good to be true. I'm really looking forward to a season 2. I really recommend this to anyone who loves apocalyptic movies/shows, k-dramas, zombies and much much more. I literally feel so sad after watching it all and I want more of the show. It's that really lame feeling when you finish your favourite show and just don't know what to do. No spoilers here but it truly amazed me and just everything about it is spectacular. There's literally nothing bad about it. And it was such an enjoyment, I really enjoyed every second of the series and it's easily my favourite show at the moment. A solid 10/10 with no doubts. Recommend it 101%!! Watch it you won't regret it!!"

I don't know what they expect from zombie movies/series!  Really liked character development throughout the episodes. Plot is amazing! Enjoyed those comic parts, and thank god they mept these comic scenes becase at some points everything gets so intense that my breathing just stopped, but thanks to those funny scenes that gave some relaxation!"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"During the 12 episodes with a total running time of over 12 hours, the heart rate displayed on the Apple Watch never dropped below 100.  The level of immersion is high enough to maintain tension for a long time, and the various zombies that unfold throughout the play made the drama more interesting.  I think the zombie acting was more realistic because the actors learned and practiced the zombie choreography from the choreographer for the zombie acting.  I'm really looking forward to season 2."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,4,,"I really liked the first few episodes of this show, and throughout it I continued to think the setting was great and the performances ranged from good to great. The writing, though, is just the laziest, hackiest garbage imaginable. It basically requires every single character to do the dumbest possible thing at any given time, with little to any justification, just so the showrunners can get to another set piece or action scene. That's lazy writing and the rest of the show (and the audience) deserves better."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"This is how a zombie series is made really. It was soo good, it got me hooked from the very start. The characters were just too good.

지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"Meski sesekali melepaskan pijakan dari ruang lingkup sekolah demi menyentil aspek sosial-politik, series Korea ini tak pernah berhenti 'menggigit' lewat segala momen ketegangan dan emosi kehilangan di antara siswa-siswi dengan ragam karakteristik yang amat relevan.  Kita sebagai penonton seakan ada di tengah mereka untuk turut merasakan takut, sedih, bingung, putus asa sambil menjaga asa bertahan hidup. Perlahan tapi pasti fokus dan keberpihakan diarahkan pada tokoh Lomon, Ji-hu, Chan-young, Yi-hyun lewat konflik percintaan/perundungan ala remaja.  Lee JQ & Kim Nam-soo piawai memanfaatkan sisi geografis SMU Hyosan sebagai panggung teror berlapis sehingga tidak terkesan repetitif. Pergerakan kamera dinamis serta tata rias/kostum dan efek khusus yang terbilang di atas rata-rata berhasil menjaga ritme show secara keseluruhan.  Zombie outbreak yang terjadi memang menyisakan banyak pertanyaan dengan simplifikasi logika yang cenderung masih dapat diterima nalar. Pola infeksi tunggal yang menyebar cepat bagai efek domino sukses membuat kita binge-watching atau mungkin repeat-viewing sambil menanti season 2 nya.  (Hopefully soon and better, finger crossed)."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,Relation between Korean Series & Zombies are always great.. Love to watch this show. I've completed almost 50% of episodes. And this is very awesome 👍 I like it... Koreans really know how to make movies & series with a lot of emotions... Want more content like this 😁
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,I had enjoyed a lot. Which ever zombie movie ever seen which is full of thiller and fantastic startagy which makes me appreciate for giving more rather I had never seen movie like this l have watched the movie 5 times again and again with full details of existing and excitement.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,This series is very exciting and unpredictable. The actors were well chosen and played their roles beautifully. The series had a good social critique of the state of society.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"This series is really great, in my opinion, this series has performed great in all the effects and scenes, even in the last two episodes, the sad scenes were made very naturally, which also attracted the viewer to the sad atmosphere of the series. The series was great in every way and made me love Korean cinema more."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"As a student, I love how the movie tries to portray real-time scenarios during a zombie apocalypse. I also appreciate the cast's efforts in making this tv series. I hope that there is a Season 2."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"Great story and very relatable characters, even tho some of them are incredibly annoying but that just gives more points to realism of charachter diversity. 10/10.  South Korea really made them self a king when it comes to zombie genre with entries like Train to Busan, Kingdom and now this beautiful gem."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,5,,"Enjoyed the overall look, story, cinematography and actors. If you're a fan of zombie movies and series that might be right for you, but there are scenes, actions and parts of the series, which are completely pointless and lengthen the series itself to an unnecessary length.  This series would have been fine with four to five episodes, but these twelve make it kind of boring and losing interest within its progress. Less is more."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"If you are still thinking whether to watch it or not, then don't miss it. Its worth watching and you wont even feel through out the episodes that story is becoming dull and boring. Every episode will leave you with the suspense and keep you hooked up. This series will definitely make you rethink about your priorities in real life. Like every other zombies series it also has many disturbing scenes but is full of thriller. The cinematography is average, background music were average too, acting is amazing and storyline is more than amazing. Each character has a background story and were shown with many emotional moments. Unlike every zombies series this is more realistic. They have covered everything which many other similar series haven't, The main idea is to show how humans are are more dangerous than zombies. They should definitely make season-02 of this one."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"After watching it, we can be sure there won't be any season 2. Cause they finished it beautifully. But still hoping for another season. You should also watch the lead actress's (Ji-hu)'s great masterpiece ""House of Hummingbird"""
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"So we have terrible acting, mainly from the adults, an awful voice over which sounds like something South Park would do, No cliché , trope or stereotype left dragged out, run over then reversed over several times for good measure. Add to this. I have Prosopagnosia, can't recognise faces easily, so pretty much can't tell the characters apart, I genuinely thought one character had been killed off only to see him reappear 2 episodes later talking to the person I though he was.  So why is it so good. I keep asking myself that. Give yourself a treat and watch it wont disapoint."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"At first i assumed that this was overhyped and going to be cheesy but i was pleasantly surprised. There are enough original takes in this series to make it worthwhile. I Just felt the end was a bit rushed and then stretched (you will know what i mean). After an episode or two i was addicted to it and had to keep myself from bingewatching it till the end. Half of the characters actually think rationally during this whole ordeal even the army people. I very much enjoyed that. I also liked that it wasnt American and thus no over the top macho BS. I think the story is finished but i do see some Angles which may justify a second season. Overall definitely worth watching even if you are not a fan of asian-export products like k-pop, manga and stuff like that."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"This is one of best zombie series I have ever seen, I love the South Korean take on the zombie genre. Extremely well done makeup and special effects and refreshingly unique story line."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"Now I loved TWD in the early seasons but after the departure of glen then Carl and the final straw Rick it became boring and soap opera so after seeing the trailer for all of us are dead I was intrigued into wether this could fill my zombie void and I'm glad to say it did,this series had some great new takes on the zombie virus and executed them well the story can become slow paced at times but the effects stunts and action is a joy to watch,12 1 hour episodes is a long stretch but I enjoyed most of it and shall look forward to season 2."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"What a show! I watched it on one go. And watching my favourite scenes on daily basis. Watching youtube reaction but cant get over it. Loved Cho yi hyun and other actors performance. Overall, I just love the show waiting for season 2, hope it comes soon. Thank you team All of us are dead for giving such a wonderful show. We'll support you. Great job."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"A little bit more thrill was expected. Although had a great time. It was not just about zombies. Ahh so much sacrifices, some felt unnecessary. Chemistry of those characters was very charming."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"The zombie based series!! Whether you are a fan of zombies based series or not, this is gonna get you engaged from start to end. You can't leave it. Each episode is balanced in such a way that you keep on demanding for more and the series keeps you hooked with its twists and turns. Another K-drama after Squid game which deserves everything. Surprised at the rating as this series is way ahead of 7.6 or 8. Deserves 9+ ratings for sure and specially with second swaadon bound to come, a lot to expect. All the characters deserve much appreciation for the phenomenal performance."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"Great movie, heart touching really. Waiting for season 2. I am very happy see the all series completed in two days. Excellent team. Lovely voice.

지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,5,,"From like 20 characters only 3-4 characters who have good acting, the rest is meh, many plot holes,and the story is average,the characters doing dum thing and that make no sense because it work  with that budget they should make a far better series than this,kingdom is far better than this if you want watch korean zombie.  Character development is meh, the only good character is the bully villain with white jacket, the annoying girl with pink jacket and the mc.  The Dectetive,the one who good in fight,the Big boy,mc best friend,and class leader is decent,the rest team is trash, fmc trash, archer girl and her friends trash  the only good thing about this series is cinematography."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,Well made series....it is best zombies film/webseries till date...full of emotion ride and characters love...all characters are extraordinary...I mention one actor (who played Chong San) his acting was brillent . I am fan this chracter...but all cast are preety good....story are so fabulous ( zombies in school) 👍👍
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"I love Zombie shows but was sceptic about this one as the reviews weren't impressive. I watched first episode, and it was okay , second became better and by the 3rd I was hooked. It was non stop action from there....literally non stop. I finished it in 3 days. Well done Korea as always!"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"Although there are some logical mistakes I love it. Friendship relationship , actors and actress , generally vibes from the series are amazing. Looks like put really huge amount of money on production. One of the main reason to love Korean series."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,I dont understand the low rating for some people im super sure they are walking dead fans because it can t be a show of 1 rating or less than 8 i give it 10 its perfect so emotional to be honnest way better than walking dead or THE last of us  Dont trust low viewers the plot is well scripted the characters developpemnt are amazing . .  I would give it a 10/10 star rating. The plot - I genuinely liked the plot. The way the zombie outbreak takes place in a high school and the cause of it felt innovative and fresh. It was interesting to see our characters fight for their life in a confined space.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,Didn't expect a neat Korean series This is unbelievable.  A clean masterpiece from the director.  Didn't have any boring scenes at all It keeps u wait wat happens next.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,5,,"Half-baked story, good effects, bad realization.  One logical fault follows by the next. I got annoyed too many times while watching the series. The series is very predictable. I was very disappointed."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"I loved it really. First of all this journal is my fav I love zombie movies,series yeah this is the second k-zombie series which I liked 1-KINGDOM 2- ALL OF US ARE DEAD."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,This show is fantastic. Don't be put off by the fact that it's young. I thought I wouldn't be interested in a high school zombie drama but it's actually a really great show. If your looking for The Walking Dead this isn't it. It's more like Z Nation meets Black Summer. Don't be turned off by it being a foreign show as well. The Korean dramas I find do a much better job at the whole zombie apocalypse genre better than most. The writing could be slightly better and the humor at times can be a bit corny but the characters are relatable and intriguing. The story has depth too. I feel as though I can easily flow through each episode and be fully engaged. Give it a try it won't disappoint.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,1,,"Irritating Characters, Slow moving storyline and Horrible Screenplay are few of the many flaws..  Had the potential for a good movie but it was stretched to become a 12 Hrs of struggle."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,I finished the entire show in one sitting with a coke in hand and unfinished cereals. I told myself I was just going to check it out but I ended up finishing the entire thing for half a day. What a wonderful run! Can't wait for season 2!
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,How can you rate one out of ten and state in your review that you only watched ten minutes?  This is very well made with great acting and direction. It reminds me of the first season of Walking Dead for its edge of the seat action. Some nice twists on the whole zombie idea also. I can't wait for the next season.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,All of us are dead movie is not just k drama movie it is a horror and goosebumps movie. It will give you just goosebumps. I just loved this movie and I am now exited for season 2.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"After watching only 4 episode don't think it's a common zombie film. It have action , romance, thriller and what not. Eagerly waiting for season 2. If season 2 doesn't release it will be a disappointing thing but this is sooo good that season 2 will be soon available."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,2,,Where do i start... this is about teenagers and puppy love kinda story. The plot is lame and the script is the worst. This is a Zombie series for preteens or younger. Not good... stay away.  My 2 stars arr for good zombie effects and cgi.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"I found myself loving the kindhearted and despising the nasty characters. I have to attribute the realness of everything to the superb acting of the young actors in this movie. Every character is complex in their own way.  This is not just a zombie movie, but.in some ways a coming of age story for the young characters. Everyone seems to mature in some way.  A well put together story and I just had to keep watching!  This is definitely not just about zombies! :)"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"I don't know why, but this keeps entering my dreams.  Unlike the walking dead series, this was actually going towards a direction.  I wouldn't watch it if it was not a mini series. Nonetheless, the terror they could put with the zombies worth a mindful exploration, surrounded with Korean cinematography is entertaining to keep watching."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,I will just die if you don't see this!! The best zombie series ever....... Its not like fantasy but it is adventurous and thrilling..... Some students just sacrificed their lyf for other students....... Emotinal as hell...... This is gonna be the best series ever.... Must watch it.....but I would just thank koreans to make this great series❤
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"A key feature of this drama is that it doesn't try to sugarcoat and save everyone, the writer has done a wonderful job on knowing when to kill whom and when to save whom. The ending was infact a bit confusing but it's not frustratingly confusing especially with the announcement of season 2. You'll cry, laugh and then cry again. Much more crying and punching pillows in nervousness than cuteness. But worth the watch for sure."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,3,,The zombies are good. But honestly all of those kids should be dead within the first 5 minutes from their decision making. Everything else seemed unrealistic.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"Wow! I haven't had this much fun with a series in a long time. The biggest strength of All of Us Are Dead is the writing, and in contrast, you can clearly see how many other series rely more on their effects, the underlying theme, or certain actors, but not on exceptionally good writing.  Here, it's the screenplay above all else that makes it incredibly enjoyable. Most of the characters are written very intelligently-something you rarely see, especially with themes like this, where characters often act completely foolishly just to push the script in a certain direction. Here, however, the characters behave mostly in a way that's logical and relatable. They say things you're already thinking yourself, and you often find yourself shouting, ""YES!!"" with excitement because you're so used to other series where characters make dumb decisions just to serve the plot-but not here.  Two things are particularly noteworthy about the zombie theme:  The whole thing primarily serves as a framework. The series focuses heavily on interpersonal relationships, human nature, society, and how people treat each other-and, of course, love. But it doesn't rely on tired stereotypes. Even though we're following a group of students trying to survive in the middle of a zombie apocalypse, every character, every dialogue, and every scene feels fresh and original-a rare gem in the survival genre!  Despite that, the apocalypse, its effects on the country, and the zombies themselves obviously play a major role. And here, the series excels in two areas where many others fail: the zombies are authentic, they don't look ridiculous, and they move very fast. I don't think I've ever seen zombies portrayed this well in any other work. Every single extra absolutely nails their role, and you truly feel a sense of awe and fear toward them. Additionally, the epidemic feels authentic because the series doesn't shy away from depicting its scale, showing parts of the country beyond the main locations. This naturally includes the military, science, and politics trying to manage the situation. The result is fantastic world-building that makes the threat feel genuinely believable. It also adds variety to the settings without making it feel fragmented or overly chaotic. Instead, the main plot gets about 3/4 of the screen time, while everything around it serves its purpose perfectly to enhance authenticity and world-building.  I'm convinced that this series would be a global #1 hit and create an unbelievable hype if it had the marketing budget of Squid Game.  Yes, Squid Game and other blockbuster series look great and make a big splash, but this is true cinema, real craftsmanship, real storytelling, with intelligent characters and dialogues, scenes that regularly bring tears to your eyes, and wonderfully fun, exciting, and original ideas and scenarios.  I can wholeheartedly recommend this series (without even watching a trailer first!). Season 2 is reportedly coming in 2025, and I can't wait!"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"The movie is absolutely fantastic interms of Acting, story, drama.  Every character has played a marvelous role.  Hats off to the makers of the movie.  Eagerly waiting for SEASON 2."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"The Good: I could go on and on about everything I love about All of Us Are Dead, but if I had to point out a few ""killer apps"" that makes this show special, it would be:  1) The Characters: I find this show fascinating for its characters. Most of them are well worn Korean TV tropes (the dashing hero, the quiet good girl, the selfish jerk) and none particularly stand out. What is fleshed out and what I observe to be a major cultural difference between Korean and American content, are the RELATIONSHIPS. Ultimately, what makes these characters great is how willing and capable they are in putting themselves on the line to save the group. The interpersonal dynamics, not unique or fleshed out personal characteristics, is what makes them super interesting to watch.  2) The Writing: This show REALLY surprised me with the incredibly nuanced take it had on government and the military. The teens, immersed in hell with no one to come and save them, become naturally cynical of the ""adults"" who promise to protect them. The show could have played on the (frankly, lazy) idea of a ruthless, evil government turning its back on vulnerable people. Yet, we get to see the ""state"" perspective on these events as well, and the show forces us to consider the typical Hollywood version of events.  If you were on the other side of the quarantine zone, would you not want your government and military to do ANYTHING possible from stopping the spread of a zombie virus? If your answer is no, you're lying.  Even the leaders - political and military - depicted are given sympathy and we come to see that they're not purely motivated by personal desire, but a real sense of duty. When the Councillor gives a genuinely intelligent explanation as to why abandoning your post to save your family - as an emergency worker - is the wrong thing to do...my jaw hit the floor. I love a show that acknowledges that the world isn't black and white. It's refreshing.  3) The Zombies & Action: Zombies are kind of overplayed. We get them, we've seen them. Half of the population thinks they could ""easily"" survive a zombie apocalypse. Yet, the zombies in All of Us Are Dead bring the horror back. These contorting, inhumane, unstoppable killing machines are legitimately terrifying and lead to some of the most intense and kinetic zombie action scenes I've seen in a long time. I think it's safe to say at this point that Korean zombies are objectively the most terrifying. It's with these scenes that the creators had the most fun with the camerawork and editing.  Oh, and lest I forget, there's some AMAZING martial artistry at play in this show. Environmental action on par with some of the best kung fu...god I love this freakin' thing.  4) The Narrative: There's a lot of fun to be had with this plot; we have multiple intersecting characters, half zombies, a Terminator style villain, government intrigue, a mad scientist. It's just a barrel of fun that keeps things going. Yet, this show is completely uncompromising as well; it is sad, depressing, and totally willing to off any character. The tension generated is insane and frankly exhausting at times.  But, the ending - which again bucks the tropes - is surprisingly heartfelt and ultimately quite hopeful. It's almost reaffirming in how much faith it has in humanity and wonderful after 12 - often very intense - episodes.  The Bad: I have basically two gripes with the show. One, it could've been cut down a bit and towards the end gets a bit repetitive. But, honestly, I came to love the story and characters so much that I didn't mind. However, I would suggest breaking the show up in chunks and not powering through it.  The other issue the inconsistency with the virus itself. I guess some people are naturally immune, but it's a little confusing and sometimes comes off as a plot convenience.  The Ugly: This show is super interesting for those (like myself) who love observing cultural differences (which is perhaps my biggest argument for steadily consuming foreign film and TV). Unlike Parasite, something that clearly came from a person who is a fan of Hollywood (and as such, it kind of feels less Korean, more international), All of Us Are Dead feels more grounded in South Korean culture.  As such, there were countless moments when I thought to myself...""an American show or character would do X,"" in contrast to these characters. There's a much greater emphasis on duty (as a parent, as a first responder, as a teacher), saving face, hierarchy (upper classmen are to be respected regardless of whether they ""deserve it""), group interests over individual interests (all the villains are people who put their own goals ahead of the group) and so on. I found this aspect of the show to really put it over the top for me, as it felt very refreshing and different."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"I went into this show with the low expectations of recent zombie flicks over the past two decades. The first episode was a pleasant enough surprise with some scenes that took me off guard and a rising suspense. By the end of the first episode, I was optimistic, and with each subsequent episode I wasn't let down.  The show's brilliance lies in a complex formula of A: great zombies, B: great writing, C: surprise twists you can't see coming and D: great characters; once they let you get to know them.  With zero plot armor and above average intelligence, the characters are the best part of the show because you truly care about what happens to them. Some become heroes, some become villains, and some becomes snacks. The collective intelligence of the group is the only reason they survive to the end; well, some of them. In the beginning they make choices that will baffle you and it surprised me too but the ingenious part of this is you see what happens when the bad choice is made, and it's gory as all h*ll. They are brutal with their characters and while some of the strongest survive, others don't due to nothing more than bad choices or bad luck  If you're on the fence on whether to begin it, that's fine, because everything is subjective, but if you watch the episodes to the point when someone offers a helping ""handkerchief,"" you'll see the show's great writing and you'll be hooked."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,1,,"Budget looks good to make a well zombie tv season but what lacks is the direction and story telling! No focus on a single character and the character which they focus on are useless and get executed, giving a useless story telling and screenplay. Didn't feel any adrenaline rush or scare. No powerful character, gets boring in between. Expected more from this high budget Netflix series and Korean drama."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"Storywise, I like this series better than ""Happiness"" because the happy ending is not too forced.  However, in terms of the actors, especially the ML and FL, Happiness won. Both ML and the FL are so good looking and attractive in Happiness while on this ""All of us are dead"" are not as attractive as the other series.  Nevertheless, Hyeong syuk - Nam Ra are definitely my favorite characters here.  The zombies were also more realistic here than Happiness.  Another part that I feel very realistic was when they needed to go to the toilet. The fact that you're fighting the living dead doesn't make you immune to pooping and peeing!!  I hope there would be 2nd season bc I'm curious about Nam Ra story."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"All of us are dead is story my fantasy I always think it's happened something in my school and I'll save everyone, I totally loved the show but there is a problem with runtime its long ,its take lots of extra time to build connections to characters, overall its good show and if you're fan of zombie like me you gonna definitely loved it."

지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"I think it's a well-made zombie movie. Since South Korea is a country where civilians are illegal to have guns, there is no such coolness to shoot and kill like ordinary zombie movies, but I think the tension from the situation where there is no specific way to respond was the best."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"Very entertaining, the cinematography is pretty good and there were a lot of nice shots The plot is very interesting, for once the main characters are not adults but young students so it was nice seeing a different point of view.  Amazing the relationship between the characters, even if it is a series about survival and zombies it goes deep in the emotions of the characters, hope they'll make a second season cause I'd like to see more of them."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"This is gonna be one of the best show I've watched this year. The production, directing, characters, performances & everything else is truly superb. I have not binged watch many shows (except Daredevil & Squid Game) because they just don't hook me into them but i was hooked to my screen from the first 5 minutes of this show & binged watched it till the end.  Now the performances of every actor was great. I genuinely loved all of the friends, supporting cast & bad guys too. It also reminded me of my school days with some good memories in the first episode. I think this one got it all from being funny to make us emotional & yeah the zombies too that were great!  You know this one's underated when extremely below average & dumb Netflix shows like Money heist, Lupin etc., or the other Marvel's Disney+ Hotstar shows got above 90% on rotten tomatoes & shows like this got below 80%.  Overall a highly recommend show to binge watch with your friends or family (No unnecessary sex scenes or nudity) . Waiting for the next season."

All characters did strong enough to wait for next season. Among all this kind of movies realizes us that what is different to be a human. Relationship, family and friends. The sacrifices which worth to keep your beloved breathing.  LOVED the 12 hours waiting for another."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,This is number 1 zombie show recommended. This series deserves recognition. The zombie kid actors are beautiful and perfect for roles. Favorites is Namra and HyuSeok. Please More more of this couple should be. More cheesy moments to mix with scary tension. The cinematic scenarios are good. There are many tense moments... Funny sometimes and mostly scary because of the running chasing and gore. Namra should show more of her powers. More actions running please...and i hope the writers add more survival survival techniques . This is nice to watch with Girlfriend or Friends or family .. Enjoy and scream same time.

지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,1,,Bad acting .......unrealistic plot...and why on earth they never tried to search for water ? Decisions they have taken in a zombie situation have been soooo stupid...waste of time...They all are not dead coz they are Morons...

지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"I really looked forward to this Kdrama, I'm a huge fan of Korean shows and as always i'm thankful that I started watching this. I think I have it a 8/10 because I'm not a huge fan of zombie movies or series but after all it was really good."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"Just got done watching the first season, it was really amazing, I love the drama and sadness. It was very tense. Bone cracking throughout the whole scenes, I'm hoping the Director does bring season two This was way better than squid game."

지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,This series is an excellent series i haven't watch earlier this type of series i love this I want season 2 Netflix if you watch the comments please I eagerly waiting for season 2 I really love the gang.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,4,,I love zombie flicks! From low budget to no budget to good budget productions. And I couldn't wait after seeing the 'This will blow you away' postings on social media. I decided to set aside the evening and binge watch it. But it was just disappointing. Are people so starved for anything zombie related these days that mediocre passes for mind blowing? I'm not sure. But I only made it a few episodes in before tuning out.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,I love this show. The story and the character actions and development are well written and logical. Nothing happens because plot needs it to happen. It's well tied up and smart. People don't make stupid decisssion like we are used to seeing in this type of shows. Their motives are linked to their characters and relationships. Also it does portray how I imagine a real apocalypse would look like where people die on regular basis regardless how much we root for them not to. However the last couple of episodes appear to be quite repetitive with similar set pieces and situations. Also the main villain and his interaction with the surviving students is just a tiny bit annoying for the reasons you will have to see for yourself. I will finish with the positive note as the show also avoids the preachy trap of western shows and focused on the story rather then social messages and mandatory tick-boxing. Overall a great show. After the squid game this is absolutely a must-see runner up.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,I like how the characters are facing zombies without using guns and instead use everything they can as a weapon. In most of the zombie media I've seen characters often use weapons to defend themselves instead of coming up with clever ways to kill them.

지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"Not you have to agree that korea is also a top country to Produce zombie's series . This Series is just another level. No word to explain this series. If you are looking for good review on this movie, then don't see anyother review . Seriously just go for this series. You will addict on it. Totally a mind blowing one. I think korea should make more action,thriller and zombies movie like that, by coming out from toxic romantic cringe type and love Triangle drama. All the Korean drama is on one story based, like a illogical fantasy romantic drama or business romantic relation type drama with a toxic cringe type love Triangle. But i saw that recently they are producing really top notch series, movie like Kingdom, all of us are dead, sweet home, the witch1,2 etc. So i think Korea should go for this type of series."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,1,,"I had high hopes for this one, but I am disappointed after watching one episode. The scriptwriter had to make the characters act so stupidly and make a bunch of dumb decisions so the story could go on. The storyline is cliche and not believable. The only positive thing I can say about this is they are trying to raise awareness of bullying, which is a common issue in Korean society."

지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"While the zombie theme has been exploited many times, this show proposes a unique variation. There is a scientific explanation to the zombie outbreak, the whole movie makes perfect sense throughout the 12 episodes."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"A truly entertaining show, with an interesting take on the start of a Zombie outbreak, as well as some engaging characters, this has earned a place as of the most thought-out zombie shows of its generation. Adding new elements to the zombie formula that provokes many thoughts on how the series will continue, as well as how the characters will adapt and change, if they survive. I am very intrigued as to how it will progress going forward, I found myself attached to quite a lot of the characters whether they are intended to be the heroes, villains or just plain zombie fodder, as far as entertainment goes this is definitely one to invest time into."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"All Of Us Are Dead is mind blowing web series. It's special for me as like other Korean movies and series it's really close to reality with small fictional touch and it beautifully show cases every possible human reaction and thinking people can make in such place.  My Review is 10 of 10 🌟 A perfect mixture of action l, drama l, humour, love and emotion."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,4,,"I'd love to give this series an 8 or more. It had potential. Unfortunately, nearly every decision the characters make is beyond stupid. They all deserve to die. And multiple people should be fired... director, producers, writers."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"First you run, then you hide and you fight.  Great zombies story, with a beginning very well written..  Too much drama I guess, but it's a corean thing.."

지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"Exceptional! If you loved Train to Busan, you're going to like this one too. It might not be moving as fast as the movie since it's a series after all. But acting, storytelling etc. Have been executed well. And you cannot really predict what's going to happen in the next episode!"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,1,,"Idk how people are rating this series with 8 or even 6 and above. Absolutely horrible acting by the cast and honestly the worst storyline...Makes me even more appreciative of ""The Kingdom"" series and the movie ""Train to Busan"", which were so well made with great acting/casting.  Gae-no-jam."

지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"Don't give up after 2-3 episodes.  I'm not a huge fan of the genre, and I skimmed through a lot of chase scenes because they get to be a bit repetitive.  However, I found myself enjoying this show more and more. While there are familiar tropes from past zombie show playbooks, there are plenty of new things in the show that have kept me engaged throughout."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"I'm so glad that i got to watch such an amazing zombie series. The best part is that they didn't left any loose ends and explained the reason and cause everything very smoothly. And the scenes were too reall i binged watched it and it felt like I'm with those school students .  Plus they highlighted the fact of bullying and reality of society, first squid game, then hellbound and then All of us are dead. I'm looking forward to it's season 2."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,This is patchy but intriguing. It has some of the most horrific Zombie moments without having to go full Walking Dead gore fest. For the me most interesting aspects were the traditional Korean cultural values (especially family) juxtaposed to what we see in western versions of this genre. My hero was the commander - his medical protocol Vs family (in the age of COVID) was a better take than shows like Contagion.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,5,,Its an averge teen zombie series the only thing special about this one is the action scene in 1st and 2nd episode its filming really well .. after that is gets bad .............
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"All of us are dead  Bursting with well executed zombie action scenes and a plot that's as emotional as it is dire and dreadful. It is also teeming with an array of characters that you would love and hate. It starts and ends well, in a way that accommodates a second season if approved.  It was also overly long and drawled, leaving room for so much redundancy. A lesser number of episodes with shorter runtime would have worked better."

지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"An absolute gem, great story, great acting and fantastic make up and effects. Flew through the season and left me hoping for season 2. I can't recommend enough. Teen woes, deadly zombie virus, desperate rescues and sacrifices. No one is safe."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,This series is one of the best zombie survival. It resembles train to busan. But it eas great to show the series interesting throughout 12 hours. Not boring at any place. Many seat cornering scenes are there . One of the best thriller k drama after squid game. Worth for 12 hours.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,One of the my best series love angle was superb i love it waiting for second season very good story line. First time I tried Korean series it was more than expectations and character of this series were very natural .
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,4,,"When it's come to South Korea series, There's always fans who voted 10/10 instantly.  Some character is annoying as hell with no backup reason. Some character can be so dumb in one scene, and be so smart in the next scene.  If you don't like to watch series with a bunch of stupid decisions and stupid plot, you will not enjoy this series.  Btw, I'm actually a South-Korea Series fan, but not this one."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"Its a good zombie show, was slow at parts but i overall enjoyed the show. Best thing about korean dramas on netflix is i don't have to watch force diversity or identity politics that are plaguing the U. S t.v shows."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,It's another wild ride from the Koreans definitely worth watching. Will keep you entertained for a weekend. There are some annoying things about characters I wish they could fix then they really would be superb. The lack of emotions and chemistry between the actors. They are great actors but we need to see a range of different emotions and expressions conveyed. For example you rarely see smiles just dead pan expressions.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"I enjoyed the series. However, what a turnoff seeing attractive Korean girls/women wearing sweatpants underneath their skirts. Whoever embraced that fashion needs mandatory jail time. The Koreans have been putting out some great zombie/infected movies in the past decade."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,I literally signed up just to write this review. Some of the characters are so annoying with them being cowards and making very obviously bad decisions and also literally causing unnecessary deaths e.g someone sacrifices their life to help the group by giving them a head start from the zombies just for the group to stand there crying and not running therefore losing their advantage. Plenty of stuff like that. Nevertheless it's a good watch.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,Masterpiece kdrama. One of the best zombie drama. It was rollercoaster of emotions for me. I cried and laughed too. For the first time in my life I have ever cried for characters so much. I couldn't even stop crying. One of the best kdrama. I so happy that season 2 is coming. This drama kept me hooked from the very first episode only. A must watch. I hated that guy Gwa-nu-sim. He was on my nerves till the end.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,You will really like this web series .The main strong point in this series is the all character have performed their best and it will make audience strongly bond with character.please ye series ko ek baar jarur dekhiye.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"Really a most horrific,most entertaining and most humoric web series that i have ever seen. All actors works are brilliant and that is the reason this web series pre production work is very good. Also post production work are superb. So, it is really a suprb interesting and horrific webseries. Thank you."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,5,,"Just straight up horrible writing.  Korea's brightest students (and movie writers?) can't figure out how to close doors behind them (might prevent some zombies from sneaking in!), that headshots do kill (only one student seems to use them), and stay stuck in their systems of rankings or castes even when it is absolutely stupid to do so. Obviously on some level this is cultural, but death and survival tend to throw all that out the window.  There are some comedic moments that make it worth a watch and there are some interesting plays on the zombie genre. But it's confusing, disjointed, and hardly any of the characters are relatable or likeable for an extended period of time... because they are so stupid.  I would walk that opinion back a bit, but one kid even mentions zombie movies. And Korea makes great zombie films! Thus the kids have no excuse to be so stupid - it's just lazy writing. And that's a killer when it comes to shows and movies based in horror."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"Finnaly the zombie korean series involving high schooler is here. The plot of every episode is solid, not too slow and not too fast. The thriller chased by zombie is pump up my hearbeat."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"Zombie fans, All of Us are Dead does not disappoint.  These aren't your slow moving dumb zombies. These are your 28 days later, World War Z infected with advanced rabies type of zombies. High adrenaline, fast moving and terrifying, this show still manages to spend time developing characters and plot.  I appreciate the amount of time they take for the zombie infection to spread, addressing issues of democracy while attempting to contain it.  Most zombie shows have the infection spread early on and fast, then we're smack dab in the zombie apocalypse.  AUAD gives us the perspective of what's happening inside the zone vs outside the zone, with media influence and political strategy.  At the same time, this show doesn't take itself too seriously. There are some funny moments, like hearted comedy, and lovable characters along with some villains. It even pokes fun of it's early on, bring up Train to Busan, as they try to figure out what's happening.  I'm half way through this first season and I'd say it's a well written show, especially for zombies."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"Shocked of the obsession I got from the episodes, exciting cliffhangers and awesome actors. South Korea rules once again and is mine (for now) Number 1 country to watch series and movies. Now, I waiting for season two! 🇰🇷"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"After their high school science teacher creates a zombie virus, a group of students fight to survive.  There are two big hurdles to get past if you're someone like me: high school students and zombies. I'm sick of teen drama, and -- although I never thought I'd say this back in the 80s or 90s -- I'm sick of zombies. I really, really wish that writers would pick a different monster for once.  I was so sick of vampires in 90s. I wanted to start a letter writing campaign to convince horror authors to stop writing about vampires. Now I'm actually thinking of begging people to bring back vampires. Look, I don't even care if they sparkle or whatever. Just give me something other than a zombie for once.  However, the zombies in this show are a little less boring than usual. I doubt that it's possible to do much new with zombies at this point, but there seems to be some attempt to give us a little variation in our monsters. They're stereotypical enough to follow all the normal rules most times, but once in a while, there's a little twist.  The characters are also more interesting than I expected. While there's a bunch of ""do you like me?"" style teen drama, it often gets pushed to the side by the reality of the situation. In the end, it helps to set up connections between the characters so you feel bad for someone when their crush gets eaten by a zombie.  The stunt work was good. It made sense to me sometimes that the cast were young because I'm pretty fit for a person my age, and I doubt that I'd be doing moves like that. The zombies did a lot of dives, slides, jumps, and lunges. It was really impressive sometimes. The fights were also well choreographed, and the stakes made them exciting.  However, the downtime between fights could drag on at times! The episodes are very long, and there's usually a couple scenes in each episode where you could have shortened it by a minute without losing anything. It made for interesting character growth at times, but other times I got a bit impatient.  The biggest problem, however, is that these teens are dehydrated and malnourished, which they occasionally complain about, but they never really show any signs of it. If they weren't ever going to do anything with that, they writers should have probably tossed the characters a few candy bars or stale sandwiches.  If you can overlook the survival aspects and the occasional overlong scene, there really aren't many things to complain about here. Sure, some of the characters are stupid sometimes, but it's also nice to see that the kids aren't just shorter adults.  Even if you watch this dubbed, you may occasionally forget that it's originally in Korean. And it seems as though Korean zombies still have some life to them after Train to Busan, which I honestly did not expect.  The second season should be interesting. I suspect it's going to have more worldbuilding and may even twist the zombies a bit more into something less stereotypical. I guess we'll see."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,5,,"This series just falls into every zombie genre pitfall that there is.  Inconsistent zombies? Yup, they will moan and helplessly smack at windows or turn into solid Snake and act as meat seeking torpedo's that will crash through the glass like it's made of paper deepening on what plot demands at the moment.  If they are chasing noname redshirts they will catch and devour then almost instantly, if it's main cast they will fumble around, unable to catch anybody. I suspect important characters are coated in invisible grease so they can literally slip out of every bad situation.  Survivors are nearly as dumb as undead masses, despite of living in a universe where zombies are established to be part of popculture.  Keeping weapons around? Nah, we don't need them.  Preventing possible infected from attacking after turning by tying them up or gaging them to reduce chance of being bitten? Who has time for that.  Avoiding unnecessary conflicts and keepingnquiet? No need, zombies can't break through anything anyways.  Military or police being able to overcome zombie threat with their training and access to proper weaponry? Hell nah, 2 random students with sharpen sticks and another 2 with bows are only force capable of dispatching hordes of infected.  Add to that love rectangle (?) with most obvious outcome ever, mandatory ""we found an infant during apocalypse so we must protect it at all cost even though we are on probably most important mission in humankinds history"" sidequest, extremely sluggish pace and virus randomly evolving just to create even more unnecessary conflict and we end up with this.  Not terrible but could be so much better."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,Excellent camera tricks and direction and the story is awesome.  Request for 2nd season.  Acting of zombie is just perfect.  Story and acting of non zombie character is also awesome.  The bloody scene are seems original.  That's all.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"Series named as adult drama but incidents happening from school. But teenages acted as matured adults. Faults are though; I feel some unnecessary feelings injected on the 2nd or 3rd episode of the series. 7 kids vs atleast 60 powerful zombies in a classroom with a barricade. Actress's dad entry is not satisfying. They skipped so fast. Incubation period varies from 2 seconds to 1 week... Why?  Otherwise overall series is a good... Cinematography, casting and making of the series are one of the best in industry. I have just 7 questions suggestions about the series that is I mentioned above."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,5,,"There's some really fun zombie action in here. The way they turn is violent and well-made, and camera and sound are great! That is about it though.  The dialogue is mostly a cringe fest, the decisions the characters make are even too dumb for high schoolers and the story is slow and just really meh.  There's also some attempts at humour, but those shots mostly miss, like 99% of the time.  Can't recommend, except if you have absolutely nothing else to watch."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"All of Us Are Dead is a South Korean drama that breathes new life into the zombie genre by placing its focus on high school students trapped in their school amidst a sudden outbreak. The show skillfully balances intense, heart-pounding horror with a poignant look at human relationships and survival.  One of the series' strengths is its realistic portrayal of teenagers caught in a terrifying situation, where friendships, rivalries, and raw emotions are put to the ultimate test. The young cast delivers impressive performances, making their fear and desperation feel genuine, while the character dynamics add layers of drama to the story. The pacing is relentless, with well-choreographed action scenes that keep viewers engaged, while moments of emotional vulnerability allow for meaningful character development.  Beyond the scares, All of Us Are Dead subtly addresses social themes like bullying, loyalty, and resilience, which gives it a relatable and thought-provoking edge. It's an intense, gripping series that offers both horror and heart."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,The plot of the series was awesome. The school base zombie series. Very emotional series character building was totally best in some episode.  Everone going to school and randomly thought zombie attack and I protect whole school. That's why they attach so much toward the character how they survive and sacrifice there friends at that moment is very emotional to me.  I love this show and I am waiting for season 2 since 3 year.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,This web series is one of the best i had seen in my life. Entire web series is OP.  You can't define this in words.  Web series contains lot of thrill and adventure. You can not predict that what going next in this series.  Korean web serieses are killing in this industry. After Squid game this web series is also a master piece from Korea.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"The series was good, even though the teenagers (and some adults too) were really annoying almost all the time. One thing I don't understand at all is what was the point of the firefighter / emergency worker dad who was to be the hero of the show but in the penultimate episode he also turned into a zombie about five minutes after finding his daughter... It didn't make any sense, at least to me. Anyway, the people turning into zombies and their movement was really well done. Lots of talent, expertise and flexible people on this show. All in all, it's an okay series. I recommend watching it if you like zombie series and movies and doomsday themes. I will definitely watch the next season too. Hopefully it's at least as good as this first season."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,5,,"From acting, to visual effects, this Korean zombie apocalypse has it all: A pandemic spreading from a central location, leading to military action and a whole cast of characters you never know will live or die. Sounds great, right? Unfortunately, this show could be probably 50% shorter and be a 10/10! Without a doubt, it is at least a few episodes too long. I really don't know why they thought it needed to be extended so many more episodes than it needed to be - I can only imagine how much more this stretched the budget - but I was so tired by episode 9, yet still invested, that I felt obligated to finish the show. If the story had been condensed and all the fat cut, we'd be looking at something truly extraordinary, but alas, as entertaining as this show could be at times, it seriously dragged for all the others."

지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"Definitely a big series. 12 episodes with 1 hour each = 12 hours of time..... I did it split it into 3 days to see and eventually it was released during the weekend.  As usual Zombie base concept but the modus operandi of the point of creation was different. The concious Zombie concept which is an inspiration from ""Zack Snyders - The Army of the Dead"". This consious Zombies are really a different kind in the script and does create good value to the usual story.  The names were really tough to go through atleast for the 5 or 6 episodes and after several deaths, I can remember the last batch of 8 names. Just for fun - Nam Ra, Haeyuk, Chiang, Yong Sue and many moreeeeeee...  There was more fun involved as well like the youtuber,the policman and the leg injured guy.  The deaths of the well developed characters are expected always - that will be the weseries trend for the past years.  The ending again leaves lead to part two and as usual I do wait for the nexr season. But I hardly wish 40 mins * 6/8 episodes with a gripping play - definetely dont want 12 hours of running time."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,3,,"Cast is generally pretty good but given rather poor material to work with Story is incredibly dragged out with multiple scenarios repeating Would have worked best as a stand-alone miniseries, but now with a second season, is sure to continue to drag out with very little story or plot advancement between episodes ..."

지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,Nice drama I love namra................................................................. beutiful drama I love namra and other characters. Netflix is very best platform for world they realise all time best movie and dramas and series.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,The web series experience was very nice. It automatically connects to teenagers. All characters are revining in my mind. I was cried at last two episodes. Humbly requesting the Netflix to release season 2 as soon as possible. Please.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"Seriously a great zombie series. Yea it has slow parts, but that's real life. Everyone just wants non-stop action because our impatience has increased with our streaming-spoils.  The kids are great actors, both zombies and non-zombies. Graphics are great too which surprised me. I've watched the series twice because of how good they did with the speed of the infection spreading.  One thing I was upset about was that it filmed a lot at the high school and I though it would be great to see the city start to spread the infection just like the they did at the school.  Favorite part was watching the first zombie girl slide across the hospital floor. It reminded me a little of Nightmare on Elm Street.  Definitely worth the watch. You won't like everything of course, but that's the case with most shows. South Korea's film industry is really picking up and doing awesome work. Can't wait to see how they do with season 2."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,I am binge watching this for the second time in a week. Action and drama in a very good balance. Top performances by all young actors. Many interesting sub-plots that are somehow overshadowed by the main story arc: the survival of a bunch of classmates. The concept of how the virus started is brilliant and very relevant to a 2022 take on the zombie genre. The Battle Royale loyals are going to love this.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,5,,"I could not get past ep 4.  I'm sure this is entertaining for the people who can turn off their brain and just enjoy but Im just not one of them.  Be warned, some survivers make really stupid decisions, it was painful to watch. Hard to relate or root for the characters because of that.  Be warned, some survivers will make some really really stupid decision that are quite painful to witness."

Namra is the coolest and my favorite character in here. I keep watching this because of her. She's so brave and calm and wow...just cool. The love story between Namra and Suhyeok is my favorite scene. I NEED THE SEASON 2 ASAP!"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"Every single thing. Down to the writing, acting and overall set design and makeup artists. Everything looks realistic down to the zombies at the very back of the set. I love that the writers are not afraid to kill main characters so you never doubt a characters death (like other shows where you expect something to save them). The characters are all well written and each and every one if them serves purpose for the show. The show has a lot of psychological horror elements and a lot of jumpscares, but its a bit less scary than other horror shows which i think is great because everyone can watch this. The show can also be quite funny sometimes, got a few laughs out of me. Overall one of the greatest korean dramas would 100% recommend."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"Binge watched it in 2 days. I love the fact that it had mutations of the virus and kept me on the edge of my seat with some of the episode's cliffhangers.. I'm really annoyed that they didn't seem to even try to find food or water even after acknowledging that lack of water would kill them. However, I love how smart some of the characters were and some of the things they came up with to get from room to room."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,-heavy on heart -there wasn't even a single episode which didn't make me cry -probably the first zombie movie/series where i was actually rooting for the zombies -heart wrenching -I'm glad that the number 01 issue shown in the series was bullying and how it destroys literally everything.  9/10.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,5,,"No spoilers - all of us are dead  well theres not much to say about it, the title pretty much explains it. End the end most of them do die or have something traumatic happen to them. I do think that this was waayy too long for what it was, most episodes seem super drawn out and it could have been half of the duration it actually was. I also dont think that it is fair that some people turned into like super zombies and were irresistible, that seemed super unfair because sometimes they would die but then other times they would turn into a super zombie. Excited to hear that season two is coming out soon, but not excited for what it will entail. Nervous that it is going to be too long and too drawn out.  Would recommend and would watch season two but probably not season one again."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"Well thought out series foremost and stayed that way through out. Unlike many other zombie movies this series stayed true to the end.  It considered how human beings will behave in such a situation too. Some remained consistently remained through their personalities, a good kids remained good and bad ones stayed bad or worse! Some people rose up above their every day selves and became a hero, others became even worse than their ugly character in fact terrible!  The series really covered all areas of human characteristics and very well too. All of these youthful actors are truly marvelous! They portrayed their characteristics extremely well and commendable acting from everyone! Very believable! It was so supremely done one cannot stop from hating the bad ones, and liked others who were good and can't help but to cheer them on. Absolute top notch acting!  A very different than those other ""B"" movies. In fact this story exceeds expectations and equal if not better to the Brad Pitt's the ""Z"" movie!  Truly deserve recognitions from many areas! The acting and the production and the direction all supreme.  I enjoyed it thoroughly and recommend it highly!  Thank you.😊👍👌💜🏅🎭Excellent!"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"Such great action and suspense! I absolutely loved how nail biting, exciting and fast paced the show was. I wrote that this show is so stressful that it distracts you from a lot of the character writing issues. I had previously written how the teenagers and adults alike frequently made such selfish choices that it felt unbelievable. I frequently was yelling at the screen wondering why would you do that in a literal life or death zombie apocalypse situation??? Like their choices just didn't seem realistic for this high stake scenario. But then I learned more about the sewol ferry accident and the depressing truth is that the choices of the adults accurately reflect reality. May those left behind Rest In Peace and I commend the show for touching on such a series topic."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,Preety bruatual show Zombies are good Storyline is good Everything is good.  Ithink all charaters are developed really awesomly in entire run.  Those of u who are complainig That else i was into and i am lost I say now is trash and its a not good show iwould say only only one word for them f$$ck off No why u guys are really dumb Enjoy the fu$$king show and let creaters get the recognition they deserve.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"In my opinion, this is a great show. It should have earned a 9/10 instead of the 7.5/10. The major problem is the voice over acting, it just doesn't feel right compared to their actual tone of voice. The plot is actually different then most bad zombie movies and adds a unique element to it with it being students in a high school, it adds emotion instead of just explicitly graphic zombie violence, while some of it is very graphic the show has a lot of emotional scenes and tries to get us to connect with the characters instead of us just being scared or distrusted at the content. One of my favorite shows on netflix."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,4,,"For me, the most interesting part of this show is how and why the virus was created.  What baffles me is the utter ignorance from on how to deal with these zombies. Even the person who is behind the origin of the zombie seems somehow baffled on what to do...  I mean, I think it is safe to assume that the kids who go to this high school have seen at least 1 or 2 movies / series about zombies. Especially since some of the kids refer to 'Train to Busan'.  Yet somehow they seem incapable to do what is necessary: smash their heads (and as such their brains) to kill them... or poke a pole through the zombie-brains. The chairs and desks have legs, right? At some point they actually have a broomstick in their hands and still the obvious move somehow escapes them.  I have to admit that I have only seen two and a half episodes so maybe at some point things will turn around.  Also, if you notice that someone gets bitten, don't just stand around... throw that person out of the window. Don't start a debate on what to do... YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO, IT'S THE ZOMBIE APOCALYPS!  Sorry for my rant, I just can't see past this very annoying aspect of the series. Maybe it's just and me and I haven't seen enough Zombie-series/movies to make an honest judgement. But COME ON!!!  Last but not least, I don't know if we are supposed to feel any sympathy with the characters, but until now there's just not enough background information to feel sympathy towards any of the characters. I like Bare-Su though, at least he kicks some Zombie asses! (but also fails to see the obvious 'scramble their brains' soluytion)."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"Very entertaining and engaging through the end.  Cinematography and action scenes are fantastic.  A new zombie variation gives some twist to the series.  Total number of episodes could have been reduced, little lengthy."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"I started watching this with no great expectations .. I just like a good zombie series and needed something that would be easy to watch ..and yet I found myself really taking a shine to the characters..it really is all you could possibly hope for in a zombie program...exciting, plenty of deaths, plenty of bad decisions for sure ..but nothing too unrealistic in my opinion.....thoroughly enjoyed this, and found it quite original in tone.. in a genre that's been seriously abused by the Walking Dead franchise among others......"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"This zombie show definitely has its faults. I was constantly irked or shaking my head or rolling my eyes. Still for everything it does wrong, it does ten other things so right. Above all else, its just plain too fun to hate. I mean its also sad and scary and bloody and all that stuff, but most of all its just fun. Also its very interesting as an American to see some of the sensibilities of youth in Koreas culture. Very different. I need another season right away. So addictive. No matter how silly some of it got, I kept coming back for the characters even though I disliked almost all of them. Very well fleshed out characters. That helps you care about and understand the stakes more. I liked Squid game but this is better definitely."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"I havent been able to watch TWD (stopped from e01), but this gained my attention. At one episode left to go I can say that it is entertaining and it makes you think a lot about your family and the people you love and take for granted.  There are a couple episodes that are boring (hence 8 i.o. 10) and a despicable bad character that survives for too long, but despite these it was a nice series to watch at night. It is not too gruesome. Next to The Sadness (2021), this is Tom & Jerry. Other Korean alternative: The Flu (2013)."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"The show is intense but still has humor. Not as dark as the Kingdom, but intense enough for a zombie show. I think it is the only zombie show that looks so much into the humanity and relationship, and social problems. So in that sense, it is quite soft, not as hardcore as the Kingdom."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"First of all its not Squid Game, but it deserves to be rated more highly than 7.6 - it is awesome. The acting is great and believable and who ever gave this a low score is a muppet. It is better than any of the American teen stuff by far, and worth watching. I don't normally like anything to do with zombies but this had me gripped, because its more than about the zombies."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"Very thrilling and emotional for me. If you lose everyone you love very truly, and still you are not able to do anything, this hurts very much. I think this webseries is for strong hearted people where lot of violence is present."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"This is surprisingly a good show. I did not expect to enjoy it so much especially with the 1-hour runtime of the episodes. But, in fact I didn't get bored at any point. I think the episodes being an hour long even made it better. Apart from the first episode where you need to be patient for the story to take shape and start, the rest of the episodes are filled with thrilling and exciting scenes.  I think above all, there is one thing the writers have done that should be much praised and admired; and that is how they created so many different characters with irrelevant and yet connected plot lines. They divided the story very elegantly into several substories. It really is a hard job to tell a story from these many viewpoints. They managed the time devoted to each of the subplots very beautifully. They don't get the same amount of screentime, yet, none of their arcs suffer depth or development. So, kudos to the writers.  There is however one thing that can get controversial reactions. In movies and shows such as this there some clichés that are usually principled. I mean despite being cliché they are bound to happen because of some moral reasons for the storytelling. However, here the show proves over and over that it does not care about those clichés. It keeps showing the unexpected being done to the clichés. And this is done very smoothly. The character deaths and redemptions do not follow the typical rules. They have created their own rule which is a very positive point for the show. Yet, the one that happens in episode 11 was a bit cruel. I think the show had already proven itself to have no mercy for anyone, so the final one was not necessary. I think that cliché needed to be preserved, for both moral and logical reasons.  Apart from this final issue, I found the whole show really exciting and sensational. It is definitely worth the watch and I hope they do not mess up season 2."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"To be honest I might be a little bit biased since this is my type of show, but the emotional execution was top tier. Even the people you didn't know a lot about made your heart ache when they got bitten.  I love that they didn't skimp on the gory part of it, usually Korean movies/dramas tend to be very soft and, forgive me for saying this, but horrible at making wounds look real, which I feel like they nailed here.  My problems (hence why I rated it an 8, not 10) are the unnecessary dialogues. This show is definitely binge-worthy, but many scenes make you want to skip forward. They could've fit everything just fine in 8 episodes, though I enjoyed the distribution of screen time amongst the different characters. It's intentionally made to be ""addictive"", which it needs to be for this type of genre.  To summarize, if you're into dystopian, gory stuff then this is for you. Good show, well made with many touching and intense scenes. Of course, some flaws but the show as a whole really makes up for it."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"At a time where the zombie apocalypse scenarios seems already saturated and overdone, there comes a show that breathes some new life (ironic, I know) into the genre.  All of Us Are Dead is an extremely well-made show that nails pretty much everything it sets out to do. The action is almost constante and relentless, but they still find time to work some effective and really well written drama, excellent characters and even some goofy comedy scenes.  There's a lot to love here, but I think what really makes this show works is the characters. In a similar vein to Stranger Things' first season, they managed to create some really compelling and emotionally engaged cast of characters. The teenagers are not unsufferable assholes like in most shows, instead they feel like real people, with real issues and strenghts, and you really want to see them succeed and escape.  It's one of those shows merely talking about it doesn't really does it justice. It can even sound kind of dumb in paper, but once you see it action on the screen, you get mesmerized. The people behind this show really pulled off some bold and creative ideas that many other would've easily screw up.  Especial credits must be given to the young cast of actors, who not only have stellar dramatic performance, but also some incredibly physical stunt work and zombie sequences.  The only downsides I can think of are some (very) minor plot holes and the fact that the show does get a little tiny bit repectitive. Other than that, this is a must watch, especially for genre fans."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"To be honest I was not really interested about starting a series about zombies, the entire concept has been so dragged out that it starts feeling stale. There always are exceptions with ridiculously funny Zombieland and masterfully directed Train to Busan( which is by far my favourite zombie movie).  For a series the 1 hour mark was daunting for me as an hour is almost half the runtime of a movie. But after the 1st episode I was hooked so if you are scared of the runtime don't worry if you finish the 1st episode you'll want to watch the next and then next. It however feels like a commitment.  The story as we can except from a kdrama was top notch, except the ending. The motivation was spot on for the development of the zombie virus( not a spoiler as that's how it's). Though the science behind it I'm a little iffy about it, however emotionally it made sense. The friendships throughout the series were so good like there was a rollercoaster of emotions involved. An irritating villain who just keeps coming back. The heartlessness of people we have to depend upon, and the will to survive. I wanna make a special note that the romance is so adorable and beautiful that you want to protect all of the ships but the world it's set-up is so cruel that you end up broken anyways. Which brings me to the ending, as the show came to a close certain deaths seemed like they just happened to be killed to attain a certain route without any development which made those deaths cheap. Also after such a harrowing experience, you'd expect a good/wholesome ending but even that was stripped from us, so basically PAIN + PAIN.  Characters were amazingly written. Like always whenever a zombie movie starts you bey on who's gonna survive, I did that too. Most of my guesses were right but I was surprised to see which one of them. As i have said you'll feel the beautiful friendships, you'll feel the romance which then will intensify the pain. Although certain characters were so useless that they just randomly died and no one from the cast seemed to care later. I found it funny and as a glitch as all the characters were saying they gotta be like a family. So that's a negative. Some moves weren't very logical and I should expect that with zombie movies but when other aspects are so good you end up expecting more. Like there's a scene where a laptop is supposed to be procured it was alright but it had unnecessary tension build up. After that scene we got into the human emotions stuff and that made me forget that scene. But still.  Sound design is very well. The way background music can convert a scene from terrifying in a moment to comedy is pretty good. Music plays amazing role in the emotions that we see on screen. Romance, comedy, horror, friendship, sadness, despair everything.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you to watch this series, it took me about 2 days to finish it but you can finish it in one. The end is unsatisfactory but you'll still enjoy it. Hope a sequel is released ( which probably will not since it's a Korean series which are mostly limited).  Thanks for reading. See you later✌"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,3,,"The resources of ""All of Us Are Dead"" would allow for a good show. You can see there's money involved and talented people behind the scenes, making most special effects feel well executed. The actors also are at least decent most of the time.  Where the show is lacking severely is in the story department. There are some fun ideas for groundwork of the show but beyond that, its execution is disappointing. Characters behave unimaginative, stupid, and unlikable to force the desired emotions (like sadness or tension) onto a scene. The overall length of 12 episodes à one hour each causes scenes be dragged out and lots of focus on story lines that should only have been minor mentions.  In general, I found myself somewhat interested in the show over the first few episodes. By the end of it, I was mostly laughing at how bad and repetitive everything has become.  If you're a zombie buff like me and think that ""Zombies mixed with teenage drama"" sounds like a fun concept, it's probably worth to give this a watch. Otherwise it's an easy skip."

Worth my time. All the actors did great acting. The Gore scenes are bit extra for kids to watch. This series deserves an even better rating. The ending made me cry. Could have had a happier ending. But then the sad ending is the part due to which you will not forget the series for a very long time. I am eagerly waiting for season 2, which is expected to be released at the end of 2023. Hope they release it sooner and with a happier ending. I cannot bear anymore emotional trauma from this series.😭. Go and watch it."

지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"This is a great zombie series! The acting was superb, and the action scenes were incredible. The chaotic battles were shocking, plentiful, and well done.  The first ten minutes of episode 2 encapsulates the series, and I found myself in awe over how so many ""stunt"" people could attack, run, bite, scream, etc. So well and all at one time. It was seriously impressive.  The young lady who played Nam-ra (the ""Prez"") was a flat-out incredible actress and amazingly beautiful too...her character was my favorite along with her love interest. You couldn't help but root for them.  Some of the characters that died surprised me, and that's all I will say there. There is a LOT to like about this series...it is gory, it is violent, and it is a story of desperate survival.  In short, its everything you would want from a zombie tale. Well done!"

지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,5,,"I was so excited to see this. First three episodes were good but then sloppy writing took place. There is so much that happens that makes ZERO sense. How can people go days and days without water or food? Why wouldn't you hide in a house or store when you know zombies are headed for you; instead, you stand outside? You see someone you care for get bitten and is turning, but you cry and tell others not to kill them?  Definitely, the writers need to be replaced for season two and stop writing material that makes no sense. Have some sense of reality and what could happen. The over dramatic teen angst and was too much. By then end, I wanted all of the characters to die because I was so frustrated with the shows."

Surely who are selective people in watching kdrama I think / and prefer choosing all of us are dead will be a perfect choice. The sacrifices , losses, they had been through and most touching scene of onjo and cheongsan literally I cried during the scene I watched the series with my friend she was also emotional If I say all of us are dead is best.  I think everyone in the series who. Are survivor will find a happy ending in season 2 I think season 2 will be exciting compared to first So love to all of us are dead if there any one who still didn't watch go and watch it on only on NETFLIX."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"The series is great but considering 12 episodes are still a little bit too much 10 episodes are good to go. You'll get hooked up in the whole series every episode gives a thrilling sensation but there are still many flaws in this series that should've been better and many people should've been alive if it is not because of the selfishness of some students. The series is lacking common sense that made you go mad for some reason just by watching how they deal with such an incident. I don't know if the scriptwriter/director is dumb or this is all part of the plan that they're supposed to look stupid and act stupid. Overall nice series but not favorite as Kingdom, Train to Busan, #Alive, etc. Still it can be done better, definitely worth to watch but not worth to watch for the infinity."

지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"Season 1: 8.2/10  This series starts with a good pilot episode that builds into the next apocalyptic story on TV! I enjoyed the build up a lot but the biggest problem with this is the big ""bang"". There was so much build up but it didn't feel super impactful in the end. It has amazing intensity especially in the first few episodes! The series has amazing art work on the Zombies and the characters are really good! Usually I don't like younger people/kids as main characters but this is an exception!  For people looking for something to watch I suggest going through this amazingly built season to see if you can handle its intensity! The plot can be mildly dull but it gets better as it goes on. The pilot is my favourite episode or at least one of them so if you don't enjoy that... I'm not very certain that you will be pleased with most of the episodes.

Seen every horror flick there is out there...not zombies though...they move slower than my grandma .. I mean...wheres the fun there...  However,I m in 6 episodes and loving this. Be patient at first..it really builds up...and worth watching due to all other social issues it raises (bullying)  Maybe I m wayyy too old(46)but really this is what bullying is like nowadays?

지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,3,,"First, its boring. How come a zombie movie boring? Thats surprised me as well.  The writing is so bad. Is the story writer newbie?  The story went slowly, they try to put emotional scenes, but the scenes were not touching at all. Theres a lot of crying but im not even feel sad. And im actually easily moved.  I try so hard not to skip and fast forwards those episodes.  What with the teen love story? They have no chemistry, so intead of moved by their hearts, its just like some baseless stupid move.  The students were not so bright, 6 episodes and none of them try to hold something for a weapon with them all the time, not even broom or a stick. I get it if they are stupid, but having a survival instinct would be rational.  Im questioning all of their decisions. Lol. These kids have no hope.  And finally, none of the cast that makes you feel like ""i hope they survive"", if at the end all of them is dead, its not even surprising, and even satisfying. Seeing how thise kids act in the middle of crisis.  The only good stuff is the bloody scenes, those are executed well. But still, you need to skip like half of the time to see bloody scenes."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,This is a really special drama to me because this was the first K drama i have seen. Actually i didn't even know this was a K drama. My brother played this drama in tv so i also watched and i really enjoyed this drama it was soo good and it was one of the best Z dramas i have watched. I really liked the actors and their acting especially park solomon after i watched this i became a really big fan of park solomon and i have watched all his k drama. His acting his amazing i think he should have more popularity. I also liked the other actors. I personally really enjoyed this drama and i think it is a must watch.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"This was an excellent show. It was exciting, dramatic, horrifying, and even humorous at times. I highly recommend it. I am really hoping for a second season."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,2,,I was expecting a good zombie series. The setting is not bad.  Most of the characters are useless.  There's nothing interesting. Boring. Bad script.  Some of the kids are not good at acting.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,Easily competes with first seasons of walking dead except it actually has an ending.  Gore is very crunchy and juicy. Drama brought me close to tears. Characters feel real. Everything is great.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"I don't think I ever watched a zombie drama series that shook me, stressed me, saddened me and literally traumatized me as this one. The greatest zombie drama series of all time. Bravo, South Korea! You've got my respect!  The actors? They really managed to show the angst and desperation of the characters do perfectly. Tje development of the characters is so well done it's almost unrral. It's like if they even exit the screen.  The direction? Absoloutley bananas!  The screenplay? The most fascinating writing of all time.  The music? Haunting and provocative. Really adds to the atmosphere of the series.  I can't wait for Season 2 to come out, can't wait to see more of the characters I now love."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,This show is pretty awesome and well done.  If you dont like teenagers in school this isnt for you.  If you love everything zombies then you'll enjoy the heck out of this.  It has lots of great zombie attacks and isnt dull.  I hope there is as many seasons as the walking dead or at least a few more.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,This web Series Batter then other Zombie web series.  And i really like this all characters.spacial Nam-ra an gwi-nam. And This series want a 9/10 Rating.  An I want know about last scene..?  An I'm very excited for second Season.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"I'm obsessed with ""All of Us Are Dead""! This Korean series has captured my heart in a way that few shows have. From the moment I started watching, I was hooked. The characters drew me in with their relatability and authenticity. I found myself fully invested in their journeys, feeling their struggles and triumphs like they were my own.  The show's pacing is impeccable, expertly balancing action and emotion. The tension is palpable, keeping me on the edge of my seat. The cinematography is stunning, immersing me in the world of the show.  What truly sets ""All of Us Are Dead"" apart is its ability to evoke emotions. I laughed, cried, and cheered along with the characters. The show's themes resonated deeply with me, leaving a lasting impact.  Overall, I'm utterly enamored with ""All of Us Are Dead"". It's a masterpiece that has earned a permanent place in my heart. If you haven't already, do yourself a favor and watch it - you won't regret it! Rating: 1000/10."

지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"This series has everything emotion, fear, connection, surviving, action, comedy, crime, friends, love story etc. One of the best series I have watched where we literally feels the characters and connect with the characters  Just loved this show The best show from korea, as per me It's better than squid games for sure Very underrated A Masterpiece."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,1,,"Poor series, no clear story, its full if zombie killing action scenes are cool but no story at all, and 12 episodes is too long for this series. And in short time too many series/movies centered on Zombies where is the creativity ?"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"In a situation when your whole world is crumbling around you, are you brave enough to risk it all? That is a question you will ask yourself while watching this series.  The story is amazing, you might be frustrated at times and at times will watch breathlessly what happens next. And you will hate the characters, but also come to like some of them. Not everything makes sense and that is alright because in apocalypse I don't think everyone will make the same choices. And this story has shown what choices this particular group of teenagers made. They decided to stay alive whatever happens and to protect what they cherish.  I had doubts when I started watching this series because neither the cast nor the plot intrigued me. Yet, I was completely engrossed after watching the first episode. The scenes are just !wow! So real!!! The moment the outbreak begins it gets max intense.  The cast has done a good job. Several characters were frustrating to watch, but in the end, that is what they wanted to portray, and they were quite successful. Even when you dislike a character, their performance will still impress you.  Despite the plot holes (and what story does not have them?), these can all be ignored as artistic freedom. (I also want to know how they are so energetic after not eating and drinking anything and fighting zombies for so long. Then again, that might be how humans would react when their lives are at stake.)  We never got a clear answer as to why some students didn't turn into full zombies (although observing story-wise, the scientist kept mentioning survival instincts, which may explain why some students mutated and hid their zombie genes).  In addition, there may be a second season based on how things were left in the last episode of season 1, so we might get answers then."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,Season 2.the characted of nam ra i loved her why she died in the last i want season 2. And all the cast i wanna meet i possible loved u all all of us are dead seoson2 i want plss😎😎😎😎

지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"This drama is the best drama I can ever watch in my whole life time, from starting 3 minutes of drama , I can already feel myself excited about what is going to happen next and next , this drama will put you in a situation of mind that you will have no option but to watch it again and again , this drama has perfect suspense and horror and this drama will take your heartbeat go up and up by every passing scene Every time when I need to clam myself or whenever I am feeling lost , I watch this drama because not only this drama hold suspense but a very close emotional feelings I am proud on myself for choosing this drama to watch and I am dying for this season 2  Love it with my whole life."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,This is my first and last websiries which i love most with my all time favourite character Cheong San and on jo but i lastly upset very much because se shown die in S1 so i request you sir to please bring the Cheong San in S2 although the movie is very very nice.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,It was a good series Watched it after #alive Idk why lol but all korean movies seem to be about zombies but they cool i like them Talking about this series was worth watching every second and minute of the movie was worth it.  Loved it.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"Plays out like a video game as the kids advance to different levels in an attempt to escape the undead. There's some real 'on the edge of your seat' scenes and plenty of blood and gore, as you'd expect, but what the film also shows us is the light and dark side of human nature, some are willing to sacrifice themselves for their loved ones or the greater cause and some are, quite frankly, happy to push anybody who gets in their way in front of a zombie. Up there with the best. Recommended."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"I fell in love with this movie from the 1st time watching the 1st episode. I got hook-up with the plot and finished this series within only 2 days. 9 episodes on the 1st day and 3 episodes the following day.  Credit to all the hard work and the creative art presented in this series. I must say, exceptional acting, excellent directorship, great casting, cinematography, videography, deep script, editing, and the make-up artist are all incredibly appreciable.  The storyline started to get intense from the beginning till the end. The crisis is presented in the form of the zombies caused by the Jonas virus.  I love how they presented various characters of human beings when facing a crisis, and in this case, it is between life & death.  Selfishness & selflessness are conveyed meticulously in every character. The human survival instinct influences human action, especially in the end, where the human-centric point of view decides to save humanity from extinction and sacrifices other beings as collateral damage.  I love how every crucial message and critical learning are conveyed to the viewers. The issues with inequality treatment, bullies, minorities, politics, fear, bold, and proactive were included.  I can't wait for the 2nd season to come. I did watch other zombie TV series, but none are this great after Train to Busan."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"The one thing that makes me rate this show higher than most zombie shows, is the lack of stupidity needed to advance the plot.  Sure, teenagers in a high stress situation make mistakes, but realistic and understandable ones.  The higher ups have some hard decisions to make and are realistically conflicted about it.  Even the highschool drama makes sense to me."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,1,,"Boring stuff and lame stories don't get better if you produce them in South Korea! Mix some Teenage highscool crap stories with a virus and let them all get zombies. Zzz! The story is told a thousand times the last 10 years in roundabout a 100 zombie series. Why stupid humans need another one? I am really sick and tired of Netflix. They are so predictable. Show one series out of South Korea, see that it is successful, buy a thousand lame series more from South-Korea and hope they get hyped the same way. Nope thats not how it goes!"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"I was looking forward to it because it was the original webtoon, but I could feel the zombie costume and the actors' zombie acting was full of tension and fun. I often saw that part because it seems like it was directed by replacing too sensational content such as rape and peeling with school violence. I think the camera's feeling and filter at that time became more immersive!!"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,Actually I love the concept that director use as a high school student becoming a zombie I love the concept Love this series Please renewed the series for season 2 This is the request form a fan.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,Although I am almost 50 I really enjoyed this series. The Korean have proven they ate great story tellers and can do it with smaller budget. But what I really liked is the healthy ethical and sensible message. And of course it's a bit over the top but to make a point you have to be more clear. The story uses the zombies to get the point across but it could have easily a war situation it's the same thing. How in desperate times you need to come toghether. How vanities and personal loss take an other place in your ego. How friendship is michorw fragile than a social media post. How it feels if you let thing be unset. How everybody deals with stuff differently.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"I can't believe how good this series turned out to be.  I love zombie movies/series but in recent years, my standards got to a very low level, as there were not many good contents in this type.  All of Us Are Dead proved, that if they want, they can absolutely put together a show full of excitement.  It was fast paced, exciting and emotional from the beginning til the end. If you are a zombie fanatic, you definitely should watch this.  Sure, there were some mistakes and errors, but which undead movie doesn't?"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,This is somehow nostalgic idk why The series was great Great acting Great scenes Great villian Everthing this is a must watch for people who like kdramas or zombies i liked. Good job Tto the director. Awsome series i cant wait for season 2 to come it would be mind blowing.but not only i cant wait to see the characters i got conected to them.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,1,,Was this supposed to be the Korean version of Stranger Things? I love Asian cinema but this is so childish And badly acted that I quit after one episode. Move along. Nothing to see here.

We can watch with family. I enjoyed this movie with my family. And completed this series in 3 days. We all loved it a great zombie movie after train to Busan."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,I fell in love with this series from the first time I saw its trailer. I liked it. South Korea is making a lot of progress in the film industry. Thank you for your good films from Iran.🇮🇷🙂❤

I would like to see next season as well!curse haters and liers."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"Now that's the entertainment. If you are keeping this in your watch list or just keep postponing this absolute cinema, just don't. Start the Netflix and be connected for only 5-10 min and boom you will also get connected to it.  You will be entertain bro, makeup and VFX of zombies are perfect, acting is perfect, emotional connectiveness perfect, character development perfect. Fine blend of love just icing on the cake."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,1,,"Over 12 hours for a zombie story!!!!! God it gets boring and repetitive after initial 2-3 episodes. After that it is just counting how different people becomes zombie and keep counting bodies. Too many subplots and hell lot of characters, unnecessary drag."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"OMGGG this drama is so EXCITING!!! THIS IS MY FAVORITE KDRAMA, I am very touched by their struggle to fight all the zombies, they protect each other and fight together and what they hope is to go home with complete members, but that doesn't happen because many of their friends become zombies, some are even willing to sacrifice themselves, while I was watching this kdrama I was very excited. The character I like the most is NamRa the class president. She is very beautiful, smart, and strong since she became a human. I always faithfully wait for season 2 all of us are dead and what I hope for the most in season 2 is CHEONGSAN COMING BACK TO LIFE. I really hope for that, if that happens I am very happy about it."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"Op kdrama, looking forward to season 2. I recommend kids above 10 to watch it due to the following reasons: 1) scary, gory and a bit depressing for small kids 2) has foul language and violence 3) brief sexual abuse, intense bullying and nudity Though, it's amazing and I loved it."

지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,This is definitely an amazing fun flick. So many good things and the direction is good. Characters are so good with acting and body language. Nice gore and bloody zombies. Good makeup and sweetly satisfying show.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,I like this korean series... The emotional scenes and the characters are the highlighted one.also the acting of gwi nam is truly wonderful.does chong san really died? I give hope for the return of chong san.. He is such a awesome character... I liked him. Waiting for 2nd season.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,9,,"This zombie show is an incredibly intense and fast-paced nightmare set inside a South Korean high school. The survival horror is gripping, with fantastic action and believable tension among the student characters. However, the potential loss of Cheong San was a huge emotional blow that left a major question mark. For the next season to truly succeed, his amazing character needs to somehow be brought back. Overall, it's a superb watch, but Season 2 needs to resolve that emotional gap."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"The zombies are active, very agile and can run fast, which is very important because it will make the audience tense to watch it, even though the content of the story is not as good as the first train to busan, but this is better than the walking dead with weak zombies, hopefully another story will emerge zombies from south korea."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"Well i dont care wht ppl say but i enjoyed the series alot. It could be the fact that this is my 2nd zombie show before this i have only watched Wwz . What I actually love in this series is from the first to last episode I was not able to shift my interest from anything else ,the jump scars ,thrill ,fear it was all that i want in a zombie series."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,8,,"This is a good zombie series, well scripted and does not get boring. I don't know if they are going to make a season 2, but it seams open to it. Wanted the ending to be more happy, but it still seems sad."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,10,,"All of Us Are Dead is an exceptional show that deserves a solid 10/10. If you're a fan of zombie dramas but want something more emotionally rich and impactful, this show is for you. From start to finish, it's a thrilling, suspenseful ride with deep character development and a hauntingly realistic portrayal of survival in a zombie apocalypse.  What really stands out about All of Us Are Dead is its emotional depth. While the show is filled with action-packed zombie scenes and intense survival moments, what really hooks you is the way it explores the characters and their struggles. The students at Hyosan High School are at the heart of the story, and you get to see them grow, form bonds, and make impossible choices as they fight for survival. It's not just about running from zombies-it's about the emotional toll the situation takes on them, their friendships, and their humanity.  The characters are all incredibly well-developed. You can't help but become attached to each one, whether it's the determined Cheong-san, the caring Nam-ra, or the strong-willed On-jo. Each character brings something unique to the table, and watching them face impossible odds while grappling with their own personal struggles makes the story that much more engaging. The show doesn't shy away from showing the hard decisions the characters have to make, and some of these moments are genuinely heartbreaking. This emotional investment makes the stakes feel real, and when characters face death, it hits hard.  The pacing is fantastic, and the show keeps you hooked from beginning to end. There's never a dull moment. Whether it's the terrifying zombie attacks or the tense moments when the characters are trying to figure out how to survive, the tension is always there. The show also doesn't hesitate to address the darker sides of human nature, like selfishness and desperation, which adds layers to the narrative.  Visually, All of Us Are Dead is stunning. The zombie effects are realistic and terrifying, making the moments of horror even more intense. The set design and cinematography are also top-notch, creating a believable, immersive world where you can feel the danger lurking around every corner. The fight scenes are thrilling, and the emotional beats hit even harder thanks to the way they're shot and paced.  What truly sets this show apart, however, is how it blends action, horror, and drama so seamlessly. It's not just another zombie series; it's a compelling look at how people react when faced with extreme situations. It makes you think about what you would do if you were in the characters' shoes, and it explores themes of survival, sacrifice, and the importance of human connection. The story is rich, layered, and engaging, making it one of the best zombie shows out there.  Overall, All of Us Are Dead is a powerful, well-crafted series that deserves all the praise it gets. It combines heart-pounding action with deep emotional storytelling, creating an unforgettable experience. The characters, the plot, and the world-building are all top-notch. It's a perfect blend of zombie horror and human drama, making it a must-watch for anyone who loves a good, gripping series. For its intense storytelling, emotional depth, and unforgettable characters, I can't give it anything less than a 10/10."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,3,,"I really don't understand how anyone can rate this above a 5. It's awful: unrealistic script, bad acting, amateur directing. The zombies are pathetic with their contortions and clicking sound effects. Another reviewer said it should be called We are all stupid. Most poignant comment ever on this embarrassing series. The rotten tomatoes rating doesn't reflect the critics reviews. Don't waste your time."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,3,,"Decent zombie action but too much drama. What is 12 1 hour episodes could have been 6 45 minute episodes. Too much filler so after a couple episodes everything is too repetitive. The bullying trope is really corny and overdone. The main villain's motives are unrealistic. None of the characters are likeable. I think this show is overhyped because of the ""squid game"" momentum that Korean shows have. Overall it is a mid series."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,2,,"This show is like The Walking Dead, but instead of 70% of the cast being totally uninteresting, useless, and annoying, 100% manages to live up to that lame standard. It reminds me of the rubbish programming that Netflix used to provide about five years ago. Back when people were canceling their memberships in mass."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,3,,"I always loved watching korean zombie movies and very hopeful while watching this trailer. But I'm so disappointed with this series! I think this is the worse korean zombie I have ever seen. From storyline to the action and movement of the zombie.  Don't waste your time watching this series, or if you want to watch it try one or two episodes and you'll know."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,3,,I actually find it quite slow and boring. I am on episode 4 now but going to skip a few. Maybe something will happen instead of every episode the same.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,3,,"I finished watching this before giving this review. But tbh......This is a very disappointing zombie movie. I just waste my time, I should stop watching this after 3episodes.  Tho the zombie's makeup/effects are nice."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,1,,"The Movies should be an example for real life, but this movie show a bad morality in each character on their movies. It's a shame, a movie like this should be able to set a good moral example for the audience.  So many korean movies like this."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,1,,"Central to the plot is a horrific theme of constant and brutal bullying, which is not only disturbing, miserable and frustrating to watch, but is the least creative subplot conceivable for a high school drama. I can't imagine how anyone could muscle through a viewing of the whole season, but I intend to spare myself the pain of a second episode."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,1,,"If you want to have a good laugh with friends, you've come to the right place. I've reached the conclusion that this series was actually produced, funded, filmed, directed and acted by the high school teenagers themselves. What a scream..."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,1,,"Upon seeing reviews, I've watched it. There's no interesting content. It has the same old zombie plot. Train to busan was a lot better compared to this."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,3,,"To be honest, the first few episodes were quite entertaining. But the dumb and annoying characters really killed the show for me. One stupid and unnecessary decision after another.  The girls act mostly like some annoying, spoiled, and rude wannabe Rambos. And most boys, on the other hand, are some weak cowards without a spine or any integrity. The characters (except for a few) were so annoying to the extend that I was desperately hoping they would get killed.  Trash writing and mostly trash characters. What a disappointment."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,1,,"I must create new account to make a review for this.  Again and again, why all zombie movies treat character as no-brainer ? I know that this is unreal world, but character is human, and human has brain to actually think ?  What they do ? Shout out to invite zombie to come to them ? Lol, is this joke ?  Let's try again, to make this genre better, at least treat character as normal human , is it possible ? Or zombie genre means human is not human after all ?"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,1,,Let the bullies be the heroes. Let everyones reactions be strange. Let's not establish any character development. Well that pretty much sums this series up.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,1,,"Such a cliché plot and unlikable characters. The series doesnt offer anything new. If you have watched any other x zombie movie this one is exactly the same no taste weak plot, weal characters."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,1,,Sooo[ooooooobad. Please dont WASTE YOUR TIME LIKE I WASTED MINE. IT. IS. SO. BAD!!! Every charaxter is mega stupid. Most of the scenes were very awkward and clicheic. I think it is one of the worst tv series that i have watched in my entire life.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,1,,"Slow, bad acting, boring, unexplained things happen and bad writing and redacting.  Instead of enjoying the series, you end up with a super bad day and angry because of that."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,2,,"Did not meet my expectation, I was excited for this show when I saw the trailer.  But after watching thru episode 5 I gave up.  The sound of bones creeking and how the body moves when they are turning into zombie is lame.  Its like sadako ish.  The story is boring, too much dialogue and drama.  Students are not going hungry.  I know some people will enjoy this but not me maybe because walking dead set the standards high.  The only korean zombie series that is good is the Kingdom."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,3,,"It was all a hype. I first saw the webtoon but i didnt bother to read it so when i learned that they will make it a series, i was excited. Welll the story isnt interesting at all. 😐 u watch these students make annoying dialogues and most of the scenes are dead or okay to be removed since they do not mean anything to the plot. I skipped a lot of dialogues because it is truly a waste of time. To be fair, the first few episodes are good but the rest is literally to make it long. Imo, they shouldve just made it into a movie."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,2,,"I was hoping like everyone if the series is of same universe as of train to busan but it isn't, this series is so dumb and cringe and just like anyother horror or zombie movie, characters instead of running away from fear runs towards it, everything looks so annoying that I couldn't watch it,just horrible."

The script , acting, direction is so bad and poor as if either maker is without brain or he assumes the viewers are. Students attacking each other's but the principle is instructing the teachers to call them in class room, a girl is so dumb that she is trying to save her friend who is turned into zombie, a guy is so irritating instead of holding the door he leaves it open to argue with his classmate, the principle is hiding under the table and eating biscuits whole zombies are attacking in front of him etc etc.  It's irritating annoying, feel like to throw the maker in front of zombies if given a chance."

However, I was actually looking forward to this and was incredibly optimistic, but this has sunk below my lowered optimistic expectations because every single minute there is something to complain about. I don't even care if it had a terrible plot as long as it was fun I would've been okay with it and I really tried hard to enjoy it.

It's just a string of events and 1 dimensional comic book-like characters who serve exactly one purpose: the sad girl, the maniac bully, the fat kids who loves chicken. It's almost satire.  Entertaining background noise but I can't help to think - was this conjured by an AI?"

When their feeble attempt to save their friend is unsuccessful, they still cry (with sad music) while he slowly turns into a zombie and proceeds to nearly kill someone else. It's the 12th episode and they still haven't mentioned ""we need to eat food and drink water to survive"". Literally 5 straight days without food or water.

And also teenage love-drama- and not good ones at that.  And some parts are confusing and don't make sence - i had to Google is to understand.

지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,4,,"Just finished the last episode of All of Us Are Dead, and was so utterly underwhelmed that it felt like taking to IMBd to write my first and only review was the closest I'd come to feeling vindaction after being duped by the +7 average rating.  For the people checking out the IMDb ratings, weighing whether or not to get into this show like I was, there are no spoilers, because this review is for you.  Having watched Squid Game and Parasite, I was quick to buy in to the high praise, figuring I could get past a quirk or two that comes with the dubbed over English translation, in lieu of a good storyline. There were definitely quirks, but more glaring were the absurdly ridiculous plot holes, (ie. Seemingly insurmountable situations inexplicably overcome courtesy of a convenient cut scene), unrealistic/completely irrational behavior of the characters in the show (where the thought that ""no one in their right mind would do that"" takes away from the everything else), and protagonists that flat out suck to watch.  Giving credit where credit is due - I did watch all 12 episodes after all; albeit, teetering on turning it off the entire time. It brings just enough to the table to keep you invested in terms of production value and SFX. I will also say, it does bring a fresh take to the zombie genre as other reviewers have mentioned.  But all of the good is heavily outweighed by the crimgeworthy dialogue, the comically poor decisions of the main characters, and the lazy writing leading to jarring gaps in storyline.  If you read this and decide to watch anyway, which you probably will, do yourself a favor by drastically lowering your expectations. And if after the first 11 episodes, you aren't yet completely pissed off that you're still watching, then the last episode will surely do the trick, (ep 12 is an infuriating turd of a conclusion that will finally confirm your suspicions that, yes, you too were also catfished by that 7.7 IMDb rating"")."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,2,,"Some reviews ""big this up"" and others don't, I'm in the don't camp. Watched E 1&2 then jumped to E 12 to see the ending (nothing special).  Seems Korean students ages range from mid-twenties to late thirties. The one upside is not watching the woke inclusive snooze-fest that would be forced upon oneself if filmed in a western country."

You get a poorly made south-korean ""pop hit"" with overinflated reviews. I realize that south-korean drama has a different formula, a different flair to it, when compared to other countries' , but this just feels like Korean Bollywood. Sometimes, it feels like a Japanese advert director was giving ""pro tips"" off-camera."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,3,,Two third of the first episode is just unnecesarry scene about the characters love life and some bully side story but it has absolute no impact later. After 3 episodes of just running around the school i gave up..

Disappointing but didn't expect too much. Dialogue is simple. Yes the culture is diff than America or Europe but story is relatable. Some really terrible emotional scenes for characters that are almost adults. It's really a waste of time after the 3rd episode. I wasted my time cuz I was in a snowpocalypse for 2 days. It's a very frustrating to watch, characters are dull, slow at times and plenty of rip off zombie scenes."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,1,,Overrated to be honest. The best zombie kdrama is still the original KINGDOM! Nothing new to see here ... for 2022 there is other drama that is worth to watch than this. Definitely a No and will not waste my time watching this.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,2,,"They set up the story with played out tropes without any original take on them (bullies and high-teen drama), and social commentary aspect takes over the believability of the story."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,1,,This series is complete garbage and unless you want to find yourself either cringing from the bad writing or frustrated from the completely dumb choices and plot armor I would recommend skipping this. If you are wondering about all the other good reviews they can be easily explained. Korean shows have a huge fanbase. They usually watch K-dramas and listen to K-pop (K short for Korean). Those fans would never admit something from Korea is complete and utter garbage. So they just give it an 8/10 or 9/10 because it is from the region where all of their beloved shows come from so it has to be good right?
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,5,,"Don't get me wrong. The zombies are great. What you really hate is the living. They act like toddlers, don't know when to run and suddenly talk about love when there is a zombie in the room. It's so upsetting seeing the characters interact. The zombies have more brain than the main characters. Had to cancel during the second episode. I can't recommend this to anyone expecting a compelling zombie story with cool characters and realistic action.  Sometimes there are scenes where the time slows down and it becomes weird. Completly out of the scene. The fighting is unrealistic as well. Was constantly shaking my head.  I watched a lot of zombie movies and series but this is the worst. Can't understand the good rating."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,5,,Seriously guys if your going to get paid to write a review by Netflix at least give it a 8. People giving this a 10 is the most ridiculous thing ever.. it's ok I guess maybe because I watched the English dubbed version they may have screwed it up or made it corny on purpose I'm not sure.. giving this a 10 is actually insulting too people who read reviews to be honest.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,3,,"This show drags on for an unbelievable amount of time and the worst thing is that the writers have a habit of killing off any of the likeable characters, usually in ridiculous ways that make zero sense.  It's like someone from Korea watched a US high school drama, turned the teenage angsty behavior up to 11 and then thought ""zombies will fix it"" the behavior they display is like the uncanny valley of US high school dramas, which are already pretty bad.  For example the character they seem to have used for comic relief is a big fat guy.  Can you guess what the comic relief is? ""I need to take a dump"" *smells armpits every 5 minutes* *Insert stomach groaning sound multiple times per episode*, this is funny once or twice. Not multiple times in a single episode.  Most of the characters seem to be generally hostile to eachother for no reason whatsoever too. It reminds me of futurama where Kim's parents always say the whole ""You ugry!"" ""You need get married!"" this is basically how the characters interact with eachother.  As well as that the directors seem to want to make the episodes drag on for as long as possible. Death scenes are overdone. There are repeat flashbacks to older episodes. Characters are killed in ways that make zero sense from a plot point just to lengthen an episode by trying to attempt to show that a character is sad, for about 10 minutes then they completely forget about it, like an NPC in an RPG game.  For example one character dies, not because they were cornered, or they sacrificed themselves but they chose to lock themselves on the side of a gate which had zombies there.  Early on it's made clear that zombies cannot open doors. However this character literally barricades himself in with zombies in some attempt to buy the other characters time, when he could have just walked through the gate and locked it from the other side.  Does it buy the other characters any time? No. They spend about 2 on screen minutes watching him get tongued by zombies. Which is kind of how most deaths go in this. They're just there as an artificial way to 'increase the pressure' and fail so badly that I found myself laughing at points that were supposed to be 'serious'.  3 out of 10, I probably lost braincells to this show."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,2,,"This show is about as bad and nonsensical as ""Train to Busan"". It's another storyline for people who don't mind having every element spoonfed to them through tropes and stereotypes. It offers no new takes on zombies, Korea's bullying culture, cheesey romantic crushes, or the ability of those in charge to take action rather than cover up an issue. If you're looking for a quality zombie story, this will be 14 hours of your life misspent. It's almost as bad as ""Z Nation"" but without the failed attempts at humor."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,1,,"The show starts, in netflix-esque fashion, with a event that would never happen like that in a natural situation.

Firstly, the characters are SUPER annoying. They keep fighting each other for absolutely no reason at all to the point is exhausting to watch. And the fact that they're teenagers is not a excuse to make them do the dumbest choices ever.  The acting was also distracting. Park Jihoo that is playing who I believe is the main character of the show is just not good...  The only good thing about ""All of Us Are Dead"" that I can think of are the special effects (the zombies are surprinsingly well made) and the action scenes (the library one was especially fun) and that's what made me watch the whole show."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,4,,"First of all, the effects are good, even though the idea or the plot itself is not original, still an interesting premise to watch. HOWEVER, the characters are unlikeable, so many inconsistent things happened, the more you watch the plot is getting messier, so many dumb actions performed by the characters, like what? Wasting 15 seconds to shot a terrified face for each student while they can actually just throw the zombie out fast is dumb, really dumb. The love triangle doesn't even help with the characters chemistry. So yeah, disappointing."

Those expectations didn't hold up past the first episode, except for the phenomenal acting. All the characters pulled their weight and felt genuine the entire time. However, that is the only great thing about this show.  The plot is infuriatingly slow paced with no character development and even less chemistry between the main cast. There are no stand out cinematic scenes, no fun fight scenes, and as the stakes stay the same the entire time, everything starts to blur together.  The creators obviously tried to make statements about human nature, bullying, teenage conflict, teenage pregnancy, etc but all of those plot lines were messy and fell apart with no emotional hit on the viewer.  I really wish I liked this show. It had potential, but as me and my friend watched it, the #1 overwhelming emotion we experienced was annoyance. If this show was a color it would be gray-- no seriously it's like they had a gray filter over the camera constantly.  I don't recommend wasting your time on this. Even for a background noise show, you can find something actually entertaining and bad in a fun way, unlike this. The end makes no sense and isn't fulfilling either.  Thank you for reading :)"

I did this from episode 4-12 (probably skipped 75%, and I feel like i didn't miss a thing. Overall the plot was manageable to follow, however far too stretched out. It seemed like these kids were completely braindead - as mentioned by other honest reviewers - and clearly noticeable(!).  (Spoilers from here) There is just too much to say about these characters! This one girl decides to kill a ""Welfie"", a boy who receives welfare payments, by infecting him intentionally (She seemed like a completely normal kid, however is now a psychopath murderer)? The other kid goes carelessly around killing anyone who says something barely considered mean? There is just too much here that doesn't feel thought out.  I would compare this to me, 12 years of age, randomly scribbling down all my emotions and fantasies of action, chronologically, without even reading through it twice before submitting to the writers competition."

Its just a streached version of 24min per ep anime to the 1hr long ep of this series by making the character do the uncanny stupid things.

They act in a way that often looks like pure overacting, and maybe it is. In any case, it gets on my nerves so much that I can hardly endure a film or series from Korea for more than 30 minutes. On top of that, the quality of the content often leaves so much to be desired that out of desperation one begins to read something into it that is not there (Squid Game, Parasite). Hopefully the hype will soon come to an end.

""All of us are dead"" puts you through mental torture - watching teenagers hesitating for what seems like hours before ""revealing"" to one another they ""like them"".  Seemingly unnafected by the apocalypse going on around them, teens played by 27 years old k-Pop idol-looking actors swoon over who held who's hand and why. We're suppose to swoon over them, too, you see?  It was hard not to turn of the series when in episode 4, while precariously perched on a window ledge inches from death, one of the character turns around and ask awkwardly to generic k-pop looking male if he ""likes <insert name of kpop looking girl"".  The sad thing is behind all this sugary crap are decent suspense moment and half-decent mild horror elements which salvage it from being total garbage.  2 stars."

지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,1,,It's basically just teenage drama with zombies as consequences.  And not a an exciting drama kind. Its like one of those live action netflix adaption of a good shot that just makes it the most horrible abomination of the show. Remember Avatar the last airbender the tv show ? Yes okay do you then remember the live action one of it ? Ahr yes the worst movie in existence. This show is close to that. I would rather watch any other show on netflix than this one. Its the first and probably the last netflix show I won't watch all the way through. As said in the title when I start something I need to finish it. This is the first time I have not felt the need to finish a series. Its simply too painfull boring and so much unnessecary stuff happens all the time. But if you are a teenage girl with no taste and would literally watch all 5-min crafts videos all day long and nothing else then this is for you. In fact I would rather watch a wall of paint dry for 1 hour than 1 episode of this show ever again. At least something happens to the paint compared to this show. And btw I am a huuuuge fan of zombie movies and series. And I've watched about 90% of all zombie movies of all time. This is mocking the entire genre.  If you can choose between homework or looking after someone else's kids or quite literally anything! Then do that instead. Cuz this will never be worth anyones time.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,5,,Typical Zombie episodic show. They could have done this very well with a 2 hour movie skipping a lot of the unnecessary character subplots which were way too long. They even reference a Zombie flick Train to Busan. Acting for the most part was very good as well as the location shooting.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,3,,It's not bad overall and has a lot of cool scenes but it get's soooo cringe sometimes that I can't even continue watching it. Some drama parts especially! It's just so cringe. And on the other way there are a lot of bugs in the show. Like who the hell puts new fresh blankets on the roof of a random school? And their clothes and shoes are literally so fresh like they just bought it. To be honest I didn't enjoy it.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,2,,"As I started watching this show, the plot seemed interesting, but as I kept watching the show my frustration towards it got worse and worse.  Firstly as the apocalypse started, everyone was acting as if it was just a DAILY THING, yes they seemed scared but when people where dying all the time all they where doing was running around aimlessly.  The first main thing that frustrated me was the fact when everyone was running away for there lives the main characters where always running BACK INTO THE SCHOOL. All they had to do was run home to there parents but they where so eager to stay in the bloody school that were full of zombies.  They eventually locked themselves in a room until some character would be bit then they'd have to get rid of that person that's been bit, and that same storyline happened like 20 times! Half the show was a friend getting bit, then it's them being all sad and having to kill them, that was repeated so many times!  After there friends are dying and everything is awful the 2 main characters are still worrying about if they LOVE each other, like why is love a priority in a situation of DEATH.  I have so much more negative to say about this hideous show, but I'd end up writing a documentary. I rated it a 2 because I guess the killings where realistic, the zombies looked real, but everything else was a joke."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,4,,I tried to give this a chance but gave up half way through the third episode. The majority of characters are just annoying and why would you lock yourself in a room rather than try to get out of the school and make it for the high ground. Plus when they are faced with a Zombie why not just throw them out of that 4th floor window instead of using stools to try and pin them against a wall? It's just one bad decision after the other and seems the director just stretched it out by having meaningless teenager drama. I just hope the lot of them were turned into Zombies.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,4,,"I know these are supposed to be teenagers but the stupidity is real. If you could kill a zombie by cowering in fear or passively watching the series would have lasted three episodes. Cultural differences aside, this is seriously just one dumb decision after another. There are certainly some creative solutions but the vast majority of the zombie combat techniques involve pushing, shoving and tripping. So few zombies are actually dispatched they're just shoved aside repeatedly. Also bashing with not-very-hard objects instead of stabbing or incapacitating. For instance while stuck in a room full of gym equipment one character was bashing a zombie with a volleyball while another smacking (not stabbing) with a broken mop handle. The military was actually useful for a change."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,3,,"Stupid, incomprehensible. Addictive. Guilty pleasure.  The characters are incomprehensible , unsympathetic and weepy. The action is nice. Nonetheless i couldn't stop to watch it, like a bad accident you can not look away."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,5,,"My favourite zombie series is Kingdom and train to Busan is far better than most western made zombie movies. Also Squid Game was very good, however, that does not mean that everything from Korea will be awesome and that we should like it just because of that.  All of us are dead is not good not bad, it has some interesting scenes, yet it feels that it should not have been 12 episodes... same issue that the walking dead had when people would rave about how ""deep"" the characters were, when in reality they did just have a lot of unnecessary dialogue and filler content that do not give the characters anything.  I found myself skipping through by the end.  Oh yes and one of the bullies is overdone on how many times he comes back.. it just annoyed me by that point.  It is meh in one word."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,3,,"Idk, why not make a show with people actually acting realistically.  These are freaking high school students in their prime already knowing about the typical zombie apocalypse.  And now it's happening right in front of them. Yet again and again the way they act or decide makes absolutely no sense in any possible realm of things.  Looking at people running at them. Not acting when there's PLENTY of time. Arguing about total pointless stuff noone would even come up in such stiuations. No brainstorming. Getting close to ppl who are turning.  God. Not even 8 year olds would act in such a manner."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,1,,"I usually love these these types of shows but this was absolutely painful to sit through. How do you make a show where every single character is unlikable? Seriously, the students are all rapists, thugs, bullies. The teachers are monsters. The police are monsters. I don't think the writers of this show understand that you actually need someone to cheer for otherwise its just pointless violence. For comparison, Happiness (2021) is a million times better zombie show than this garbage."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,5,,Bad acting all round. I hate it when everyone just stop and stares and wait for the person to turn to a zombie before doing anything at all..... Not enough passion from the characters they all seem way too relaxed...
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,1,,"Too many unnecessary scenes and characters. The characters themselves discussed too much ""morality"" to the point where all of the talks became distracting and boring. Yes there are zombies and they run around but at the end of the day no one really knows what messages the series tried to deliver. It's not even that entertaining (again because of all the talks and typical Korean-style drama). There is zero character development or meaningful plot development of any sort. IT IS ABSOLUTELY FRUSTRATING TO WATCH. SOMEBODY GOTTA TELL THE TRUTH. Sorry to the series, but Train to Busan is a tough one to beat."

But if you're looking for a good movie, you're better off choosing something else."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,1,,This review is more like a rant. I am onto the third episode now and i have to stop watching. Its gorey. There's people biting each other off which lasts for minutes. The story never proceeds. I was looking for the detective to extract more information out of the scientist but that just never seems to happen. It could easily be fit into an hour or so. The police never seems to come. The plot is boring. Nothing much happens.  I am sure netflix is inflating its ranking. I dont know how a giant like netflix put this garbage of a show in their platform. Hell I would'nt even give it one star. I was hyped after watching squid game but this one sucks.
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,3,,"... but not in a good way. Three episodes in and I'm tired of the students making horrible decisions. From standing around while another student turns, tolerating another entitled student, settling on a classroom on another floor when there were plenty on the way to choose from, putting your fellow students and friends in danger by not disclosing that you've been bitten to feeling depressed in the middle of it all when you should feel a sense of urgency. They say that if you can't be a model by showing others how they should do things, be an example by showing others how they shouldn't do things. This series falls into the latter category. The only redeeming thing so far is that there is a fighter and a thinker in the group. Everybody else is, pretty much, useless and a liability. ""#Alive"" and ""Train to Busan"" were more comprehensive. They had their flaws, but not to the extent of this series."
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,2,,"Everything about the series follows the stereotypical (and I would argue high-quality) design of a Korean Zombie flic, which is great overall. The problem is that the plot flow is terrible, because it is focused around drama and not logic.. you find yourself constantly questioning why the writer(s) decided to sacrifice this character or that character at this or that moment, when it logically provides no benefit to the actual situation. It's too focused around these flaws and the drama produced by these flaws that it sacrifices the clear advantage of being a well produced cinematographic series. For example, the logic of how these super zombies function doesn't flow with the actual plot and just is used to segment into the next portion of the plot. The cheesy or corny design of each segment and it's climax (for example, how the rescue operation is of course botched at the very last moment, etc.) just doesn't produce a convincing or immersive world for the audience. The series is overrated for the overall quality due to the flaws in plot and flow, and it is too centered around useless drama. Otherwise, the production is very high quality, but the flaws are highly discouraging.  Starts slows and gets rolling but even after it starts rolling, the plot issues are too significant to seriously consider this a functional TV series."

I do not recommend this to anyone of the Catholic religion. And now the review of the rest, I watched sync in English (netflix), the sync is extremely poorly done, so it's one iritating disaster of the sync. This series promotes violence and abuse (doh so of course zombies are involved, but not that, it actually promotes peer bullying and abuse). The scenes are sometimes too stretched it's really monotonous. It's too bloody and bizarre for some more serious impression. This is just another failed zombie screenplay, this series is a nightmare, no future there! Not recommend!"
지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,3,,Watched the whole thing despite it being very bad. Had a couple of redeeming aspects like the halfbie concept but overall just lame. It really drags everything out for so long. The constant falling over gets really annoying. Go watch Black Summer if you want zombies. Go watch 8th grade or Booksmart if you want modern teen drama.

지금 우리 학교는 시즌 1,All of Us Are Dead Season 1,2022,4,,"You would be hard pressed to find redeeming qualities of this show. The plot is exciting only for the first episode, then it becomes tiring, repetitive and predictable. Zombies apparently are stopped by a thin glass door but can climb over a barricade with no problem. Characters heroically going over great lengths to become saviours...then die 5 minutes later for no good reason other than needless drama. That's for the first part.  For the second part, we have a cold scientist who blanks out, a military leader who can't handle the weight of his own decisions and countless characters who are so incompetent at walking and running they stumble and fall on flat surfaces. I view all of these decisions as a cheap way to create drama. Don't insult your viewers.  As for the positives in this series, the action is at times entertaining, the universe logic does make sense at times and the unfolding of events is somewhat realistic. That's pretty much where the positives end, unfortunately. Weak show, could've been done much better."

Pros : if you dont expect great acting or memorable character/story and only try to find decent zombie movie/tv-series, its watchable.  They should put the drama genre down, its far from train to busan, even if its only 2 hours movie, the character development better than this."

And the characters in this show is sometimes to god damn annoying and/stupid I wanna punch the screen. They makes the worst choice most of the time.  The dialogs between characters and what happens between them seems so unrealistic it ruins the atmosphere.  The females just stand in the background and scream while all the males has to handle things.  There are few moments where it gets exciting, but the characters simply ruin this show."

If you give it the benefit of the doubt and consider it a simple resolution to filming some entertainment during mask mandates in the covid pandemic, then we can work with that.  It's hard to establish hard science rules and lore for dystopic worlds to begin with, for a Netflix show, this is pretty damn good, it's no 'Black Mirror' but there's only so many Charlie Brooker's in the world.  So, if you want to binge and kill a weekend over some mindless action that takes you into sci-fi tropes with some cheesy CGI without a poorly executed will-they-won't-they romance, let's go. Bet."
택배기사,Black Knight,2023,6,,"This was not what I expected. First of all, the world building was weak and although I knew it was a dystopian setting, it felt like a combination of different things that just didn't work. The plot was barely there too and even then there were plot holes scattered around. The characters felt one dimensional as well and I feel so bad saying this because I really like Kim Woo Bin but this drama didn't do him much good in terms of showing off his acting skills. The fight scenes were pretty good though and the CGI wasn't bad but it wasn't the best of course. Overall, this is a drama that suffers from poor writing and it's unfortunate because it does have the potential to be a good and memorable show. Instead, it just falls flat."
택배기사,Black Knight,2023,5,,"This has potential to be good but the story is too convoluted for me. Very hard to follow along. I feel like is better to make this 2 hour movie instead of a show to be honest. There's no depth in any of the characters, you don't feel invested in any of the characters. And there's some big actors in this show too. Some of the cgi looks very bad. The dialogue is awful. I love dystopian type of show/movie and this wasn't it. If you're hoping for a romance or comedy there ain't none. There's only like 6 episodes so you can probably binge watch it in a day. Overall I give this show a 5/10 ratings. Don't expect this to be like hunger games/divergent/maze runner because is not."
택배기사,Black Knight,2023,7,,"The acting is alright, not incredible, but better than most Netflix films these days. In the action scenes and emotional scenes they were quite bad.

The action and fighting scenes were really unrealistic and very bad, sure some of 'em were great, and Really drew me in, but others just made me roll my eyes and laugh. The stupidity of some of these characters and the unrealism was embarrassing to watch. The action: 6/10.  The cinematography and cgi is very well done, it makes it really feel like a dystopian show, (unlike others) with the amount of blood and dirt in some scenes really made it feel realistic. 9/10  Storyline; the storyline is nice. Not too basic but also quite basic. The main character being stronger than everyone for almost no reason, while also getting random people to line up to fight with him? It's been done too many times. But I'll take it with the ubiquity of the show and some (not many) of the characters. 7.5/10."

I couldn't even go past the first episode as I was struggling to see what the hell was happening.  It feels like a low budget action flick that had great hopes and yet it was disappointing.  If you're planning on watching this, don't do it over daytime.  PS.

택배기사,Black Knight,2023,7,,"""Black Knight"" is an exciting science-fiction series that takes us to a dystopian future where the world is ravaged by air pollution, and resources are scarce. The Korean Peninsula is now a desert wasteland, and the remaining population relies on an elite team of deliverymen called ""knights"" to survive. The series follows the story of one particular knight, 5-8, who is determined to take down the Cheonmyeong Group, the crooked ruler of the devastated world.  The series is expertly crafted, with a compelling storyline that keeps you hooked from the first episode to the last. The visuals are stunning, and the world-building is top-notch, immersing you in this bleak and dangerous future world. The characters are well-developed, and the acting is superb, with standout performances from Kim Woo-bin as 5-8 and Song Seung-heon as Ryu Seok.  Kim Woo-bin's portrayal of the legendary knight 5-8 is particularly impressive. He perfectly embodies the character's toughness and determination, making it easy to root for him as he battles against the corrupt Cheonmyeong Group. Song Seung-heon is also excellent as Ryu Seok, the ruthless heir to the Cheonmyeong Group. His performance is nuanced and complex, making it clear that there is more to his character than meets the eye.  Kang Yoo-seok and Esom also deliver fantastic performances as Sa-wol and Seol-ah, respectively. Yoo-seok brings a sense of youthful energy and optimism to Sa-wol, a refugee who dreams of becoming a knight, while Esom's portrayal of Seol-ah, a military officer who wants to do the right thing, is nuanced and layered.  Overall, ""Black Knight"" is a must-watch for fans of science-fiction and dystopian stories. With its gripping storyline, stunning visuals, and fantastic performances, this series is sure to leave you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end."
택배기사,Black Knight,2023,6,,"The show is set in a dystopian future where Earth is devastated by pollution and climate change, forcing humans to wear protective masks to survive. Visually, this show is an absolute treat. The series boasts stunning visuals and impressive special effects that bring the post-apocalyptic world to life. The action sequences are well-choreographed and manage to captivate viewers with their intensity. The cast delivers commendable performances. However, the series has its share of drawbacks. The plot, while engaging, follows a predictable trajectory, leaving little room for surprise. At times, the pacing can be sluggish, causing the narrative to lose momentum. Additionally, this show struggles with originality, drawing heavily from other post-apocalyptic works like Mad Max and The Walking Dead, which may dampen the experience for those seeking fresh concepts. This show is a solid sci-fi action series with breathtaking visuals and strong performances. It will likely appeal to fans of post-apocalyptic films and shows who appreciate well-executed action sequences. However, its predictable plot and occasional slow pacing prevent it from achieving true greatness. This show is recommended for viewers seeking visually stunning entertainment within a familiar genre. Those seeking groundbreaking originality may find themselves longing for more."
택배기사,Black Knight,2023,6,,"I find the literal thought process between American and Korean cultures when approaching this genre very amusing!  Even with other genres of movies, the formalness, respect, and acceptance between the good and bad is very humorous . I wonder if this is how life really is approached in the Korean culture, for example the bad guy saying ""please don't kill me"", and the protagonist saying ""that's a shame"", after the gun doesn't fire, and then goes on to say ""next time the gun will be loaded"", while saying to his partner ""you okay Newbie?"". I wonder if there is something lost in translation, or if this is really how our cultures differ. This specific example - I wouldn't call a spoiler.  As silly as the plot is, the action and story in this apocalyptic world is good for laughs. To me, it's just funny how literally the story is laid out, and how respect between good and bad is imbedded in the story, in many aspects.  I love and appreciate the crossover between USA and Korea over the last decade, and hope to see more movies from Korea make its way into the main stream!"
택배기사,Black Knight,2023,6,,"This is too similar to the millions of movies and shows Americans have done over the years.  It gives me vibes from movies like Mad Max, Elysium or even the Divergent Saga.  I absolutely love korean productions but lately they seem to focus too much on make remakes and versions of formulas already used too many times. They also need to understand that for an international audience, they need to include more women, it's ridiculously obvious that ALMOST ALL cast are men.  It's a shame because I know the actors are great but unfortunately you won't get attached to any of their characters because there's not enough context and they won't show us enough of their lives and past.  This could have been perfectly a movie.  On the positive: the music was cool and the fight choreographies were also good, no surprise there for a korean production."
택배기사,Black Knight,2023,4,,"""Black Knight"" is a Korean sci-fi TV series aimed at teenagers that falls short on multiple levels.

The premise of the show centers around a world where oxygen has become a scarce resource, despite being the #1 most abundant element on the planet. The show attempts to create a dystopian future where oxygen is so precious that people are forced to risk their lives and kill each other over it.  Furthermore, the way in which the show handles oxygen is absurd. The characters wear filter-type masks that provide no oxygen, which seems like a glaring oversight. The delivery of oxygen by truck in tiny bottles is equally ridiculous, as that amount of oxygen wouldn't last a day. Surely, the creators could have come up with a more believable solution, such as piping in oxygen or building domes with oxygen generators.  The characters in ""Black Knight"" are cartoonish and one-dimensional, with no real depth or development. The action and fight scenes are similarly silly and unimpressive. All in all, ""Black Knight"" is a forgettable show that fails to deliver on its promise of an engaging sci-fi adventure."
택배기사,Black Knight,2023,8,,"I disagree with reviewers here that the series is average at best. There's a lot to like here given there are only 6 episodes. The biggest negative is the casting of a kid (5-7) where a more adult character would have been more believable. However, the main character of ""5-8"" is enjoyable to watch. Some excellent acting, and some average, but overall, I keep coming back. The villain could have been more fleshed out, but again, 6 episodes. The best part of this series is the lack of politically correct characters that we apparently MUST include in every American-made show. It's such a relief not to be dragged through the morass of every single demographic that exists. I also like the premise of the show. Graphics are actually pretty good and so I have been entertained. I'll be back for more Korean shows."
택배기사,Black Knight,2023,7,,"I'm giving this 7 out of 10 as it loses 3 points for the plot holes and somewhat silly bits.  However, the look of the show is great, and I really liked the characters. I do like Kim Woo Bin but the show wasted him to some extent. That said, he was fine as a mostly masked tough guy, though I would have liked to see more of him from his pre-delivery man days.  I really like Esom too. She was competent in this but it would have been nice to see her character be something other than grim a few times.  I really liked Ya-sol, his three friends and grandfather, and also Esom's sister.  Overall, I felt like the series was too short and things happened too quickly but the actors, acting and cinematography were all good."
택배기사,Black Knight,2023,7,,"I enjoyed this dystopian Kdrama very much! The Koreans do so many things better in their filmmaking than we do here in America. They explore the morality of things more thoroughly, the relationships, visual effects, etc. In a way Westerners do not. I would love to have had another season so they could have spent more time on back stories of the characters and had more time to develop the plot. Kim Woo Bin is a very good actor as is Esom and Roh Yoon-seo (although her part was just one episode. I didn't recognize the others but thought they did very well in their roles. I am surprised this was so panned by people. I watched it over two days and then waited to finish it because I didn't want it to end. It was wrapped up too quickly!!"
택배기사,Black Knight,2023,7,,"There was the c☄met. That was 40 years ago. 1% survived. Most continents are underwater. Kcountry looks like the set from Mad Max Fury Road-9. Breathing is only possible with the assistance of the Aircore, which is basically a massive air purifier. People reside in the core districts - at least the lucky ones do. Others must try to survive in the wilderness of the outer districts and breath through masks. One way to improve one's station is to become a postal worker; in this world they're called deliverymen. It's dangerous. ""Neither rain, nor snow, nor sleet, nor hail shall keep the postmen from their appointed rounds,"" is the famous pledge. But there's much worse out there now. Apart from the harsh terrain, there's the thieves, hunters and raiders.  BK is a 2023 release that is rated 88 on AWiki. It is 1 season consisting of only 6 45-minute episodes. This dystopian future is one in which a few have all the privileges at the expense of the many (sounds familiar). Those on the fringe are used up, and once the oligarchy has used them up, they want to throw them out. ""5-8"" is the premier deliveryman - He's a legend. Through the course of the show he uncovers the plot to eliminate the outer circles of civilization. He forms allies, willing and reluctant, to fight the diabolical power structure.  Kim Woo Bin, the person who most makes The Heirs-7.3 worth watching, plays 5-8. He's a superb male lead and he only adds to BK's value. He shines in Our Blues-8.5. Kang Yoo Seok (Growing Season) is solid as Yoon Sa Wol, his charge. Esom, one of the brightest stars in Because This Is My First Life-7.7, plays Jung Seol Ah, a military officer who does things by the book. No partiality. Song Seung Heon (Saimdang-8.5, Player, Black-9, Wonderful Nightmare) plays villain Ryu Seok. What are they doing to my guy? This actor is a fabulous romantic lead. I hate seeing him as someone odious; and odious he is. His rigid facial expressions and body language make him unrecognizable compared to how he appears in Black or Saimdang, the only exposures I've had to him. His range is a credit to his acting prowess. I still don't have to like it. The screenwriter / director is Cho Ui Seok of Cold Eyes.  BK is executed well which is why I'm not sure why I didn't like it more. The action is respectable - quite good, actually, and at times fabulous. The artistry is big-budget, a very cool windstorm being one example. There's shades of Planet of the Apes in a shot of a toppled Namsan Tower smack in the center of the dust bowl. The story is solid and the acting is strong. In this case, the individual elements weirdly add up to something less, though I can't pinpoint why. Things that come to mind are, first of all, it is all retread - there is nothing original at all in BK. That's a criticism that means little, though, if the execution is solid. Thus, I must surmise that there's something lacking in the execution. It's put together alittle too loosely; the cadence and direction are uneven. I almost wonder if a re-edit could fix it. The tempo is mostly slow and brooding, but that only works when the writing is dynamic. Here, the writing does not have a high enough IQ - There's nothing to brood on. The same criticism can be applied to the fact that BK did not engage me emotionally. For a feature to be truly good it must tickle the heart or the head (or both), and BK does neither. Despite some stellar action scenes, it lacks sufficient adrenaline to be qualified as an action piece, and it lacks the proper tension to be a thriller. What we're left with is some dusty vanilla ice cream.  Hey, I love ice cream. I love it enough to lick through the dust and enjoy the good stuff (AKA Kim Woo Bin;). My favorite genre is sci-fi / fantasy with romance being hitched right behind it (action and comedy follow closely). Apart from comedy, sci-fi / fantasy is the most demanding to write. Coming up with new worlds has endless challenges - just check with GRRM (George RR Martin) on that. So from my perspective, BK is worth watching, at least once, for what it does offer. I /know/ I overrated it at ""7"". I was tempted to go lower but it didn't sit right. I'm convinced a larger than average portion of the viewing population will not enjoy BK. I trust that will help you decide whether to hop in the truck and take the ride or sit this one out.  〰🖍 IMHO  📣7 📝7.6 🎭7.7 🎨8 🎵/🔊7.3 🔚7.8 ▪ 🌞3.5 ⚡8 😅1 😭5 😱4 😯4.5 🤢5 🤔5.5 💤0  Age 14+ for violence Language: $h!+; Rated TV-MA: Mature Audience Only.

택배기사,Black Knight,2023,6,,"Starting with the positives, this show contains good CGI and reasonably good acting. That said, it still felt like it was missing something impactful. The production felt rushed and left too many unanswered questions. The pace was snail speed, which is due to the excess scenes that should have been cut. This show could have been improved in two ways -- shorter to maintain the urgency or longer by adding additional scenes that would have answered unanswered questions. It is fortunate that the final episode saved the series a bit, otherwise I would have felt that I wasted time watching the previous five episodes. In general, this is an acceptable show. Not one of the best on this topic, but not unwatchable either."
택배기사,Black Knight,2023,10,,"I am amazed by the relatively low critics score.  This is a beautifully made and very cool serie.  The Korean productions are so brilliantly more inventive and beautifully put together compared to most of the west world productions.  I have to agree than maybe this script is not very engaging and does not live up to the perfect visuals, photography, set designs. Yet it's thoroughly enjoyable. I would definitely dare say that technically and visually it is up there with the best. Let's be honest, this is a much better quality production than the Squid Game, so for me it deserves a much better critics recognition, at least technically by a production point of view.  Actors are all great and very likeable. And, for once, even the American accent voice over actors are not as bad and annoying.  I'm totally in love with Korean film making. Well done."
택배기사,Black Knight,2023,6,,"I enjoyed this short series. Nothing special or groundbreaking but nothing wrong with it either. It is your standard story of a dystopian future where the powerful are abusing the weak and our hero leads a small group to set things right.  The acting and action sequences were good although some of the combat sequences devolved into the bad guys can't shoot, cannon fodder that happens too often in these types of movies.  The cinematography was great - not a lot of color but that is how dystopian landscapes often look. The story was pretty good and they did not have any glaring holes in the plot-line.  Overall, a decent watch."
택배기사,Black Knight,2023,3,,"Absolute garbage. Bruce Lee style one man armies beating up hoardes of bad guys single handedly in the first ten minutes made me immediately concerned about what was to come. Sure enough it didn't really get any better. Tries to be funny but it's painful. I love a lot of the Korean stuff, they've produced some outstanding series over the past few years, sadly this is not one of them. If you're incredibly easily pleased with a nonsensical plot, poor characters and a poorly crafted world go knock yourself out. For anybody in the slightest cerebral I would suggest you will find this excruciatingly bad."
택배기사,Black Knight,2023,6,,"Black Knight released on 2023 Netflix series is good to watch but, do not expect too much from it. This series is dystopian related but somehow i did not found it too much good while watching it. The quality of the series was good and the visual was good too really i have to admit it. I will suggest you to watch but, do not expect too much.  27 July 2025 Watched H Dubbed On Netflix 1 season 6 episodes watched full."
택배기사,Black Knight,2023,5,,"The Korean sci-fi series set in a post-apocalyptic world falls short in many aspects. Every element in the series feels blatantly fake and the overall quality seems to be lacking, almost resembling a low-budget production. The storyline, derived from a shallow cartoon, lacks depth, and the dialogue feels unnatural. Additionally, it attempts to imitate Western series, lacking originality and proper execution. Moreover, the constant insertion of comedic elements contradicts the realistic tone of the post-apocalyptic world. The only positive aspect is the short length of the series, with only 6 episodes. For those who enjoy Korean dramas and are looking for something slightly different, it might be worth watching, but it's advisable not to expect too much."
택배기사,Black Knight,2023,10,,"Nice show, it keeps you hooked, i watched episodes 1-5 in a row .The scenary reminds me, a bit, of Mad Max, same dusty atmosphere. Kim Woo-Bin is doing a great job playing 5-8. The fighting scenes are good and i like the fact that they are not unbelieveble long.  The futuristic costumes and wardrobe are a catch-eyed and the admirable visual effects place you in the middle of the action.  Ofcourse the show missed some logical points, but there are not imposibile to go along with. I don't know how the show will end yet, the purpose of this review is for a high rated star for a good Kdrama series."
택배기사,Black Knight,2023,9,,"Ignore all the negative reviews this series. Especially those which allude to Black Knight being a $2Billion Hollywood blockbuster that failed to reach its audience. Shame that those who reviewed it negatively didn't view it objectively or with any impartiality.  Kim Woo-bin steals the show as ""5-8"" - a legendary delivery man who is the hero of the people in this wonderful post-apocalyptic sci-fi series. He's got the dashing looks, ""the look"", the voice, the tough-guy walk, with a high level of acting skills, to pull it off remarkably. I totally enjoyed his portrayal of a man who is fighting the odds, and an evil mega corporation, to bring some justice into a very damaged and struggling world.  The cast are all great, and the storyline throughout is a familiar one - albeit told with a twist on who the bad guys really are. This is not very demanding on the brain and you don't have to always read between the lines or put up with major plot holes, because the story moves along at a nice pace and almost everything is explained and/or accounted for easily. Leaving the viewer to experience events without much effort and enjoy the show.  It's a great series and I hope there is a second season. There's certainly much more work for ""5-8"" to do and plenty of bad people to deal with in Black Knight, that's for sure. I'd love to see more of Kim Woo-bin in this role, and the rest of the cast.  Black Knight is definitely a breah of fresh air for sci-fi and a thoroughly enjoyable one. I'd recommend anyone to watch it from start to finish at least twice."
택배기사,Black Knight,2023,4,,"Sadly, Black Knight is no new Squid Games: what we get served are action scenes that are at best mediocre executed and have the realism of some Manga action, the world-building and the characters also leave a lot to be desired - the whole affair left me rather bored and indifferent. Maybe my expectations were to high for this one, but to me Black Knight was a really disappointing experience. What else to say? Well, there might be still a chance that you like Black Knight more than I did - in the case you like Peninsula and Army of the Dead (I don't), this show may still provide some entertainment to you."
택배기사,Black Knight,2023,2,,"First of all, they clearly have an issue with how to balance the lighting for each scene so basically you can't see much in those dark scenes and if you adjust your screen settings then you could potentially blind yourself during the bright scenes.  The inconsistancy of the need of mask or oxygen is very confusing. It seems that they somehow just use this condition to fit whenever they need the story to reply on it. It a major mood kill for me.  The more you watch you might get the feeling that if Hunger games and Fast&Furious adopted a korean baby they'd named it ""The black knight""  I get that they wanted all family feel good action comedy in one pot but it just doesn't work.  I waited 5 ep before I write this comment because I wanted it to be good ..but it never did."
택배기사,Black Knight,2023,10,,"""Black Knight"" is a perfect example of why Asian TV is currently leading the pack. Unlike some Western dystopian shows that often rely heavily on special effects, ""Black Knight"" uses a compelling story and deep characters to draw you in. It's set in a future where oxygen is delivered like pizza, and the twists and turns in the plot are mind-blowing. Its Asian setting adds a unique flavor, blending futuristic tech with rich traditions. This show proves that Asian TV is more than just a rival to the West - it's setting the bar. I can't wait for more like this to come. I think it's a good wake-up for other directors."
택배기사,Black Knight,2023,10,,Really well done. Loads of action. Great cast and plot was really interesting. Special effects where done fantastically. Great production and editing. Highly recommend this series. I wish it had more episodes wonder if there will be a season two. Also has comedy at times and I really enjoy the interaction he has with his friends. Overall not a korean series to be missed you won't be disappointed. Main lead and main character is very handsome. Hope more watchers will leave a review cause it really is a good series. Really enjoyed the fight scenes they where done really well and was also sad at times but definitely 10/10 from me.
택배기사,Black Knight,2023,5,,"Those two movie/shows came to mind after the first 15min or so. Another post apocalyptic meandering. I had high hopes, Korea.  By about the 'critical' event, and secret of the young refugee I thought thisbis getting complicated. But then no follow up. Same as when the villain showsup, then shows up again and again with his father without any consequences.  The main character had no emotion, no dimension, only a simple back story. I should've stopped there. Everything seemed incomplete, or budget has been cut. Plot points are thin and obvious. Very first Draft. And by the last episode, everything is hurried, mindless."
택배기사,Black Knight,2023,10,,"Please help, this is just a fiction, don't take it too seriously. It's difficult to explain scientific aspects, can you criticize but can you create them? Judge wisely, look at the CGI and the performances of the actresses and actors involved.  They deserve appreciation for working to their fullest potential under challenging conditions.  The uniqueness of this film is that I personally have never watched it before, so I can't compare it to other films. You can discover legends within one another, but this is just one, come on guys they are unique !!!!  Hope you guys enjoy this series. I love all the character!"
택배기사,Black Knight,2023,5,,"Korean Drama "" Black Knight "" is a sci fi drama taking place in a dystopian future.  The drama is full of action, political manipulation, and, underneath all that, human relationships.  The action scenes, first of all, were pretty enjoyable, with nicely choreographed fighting scenes and interesting twists.  The main plot is also intriguing, with the relationship between the boy and the Knight being the center and heart of it.  However, this drama is one of those series that needed more time to properly develop. Unfortunately, its length meant that the story is rushed and everything happened too quickly and too sudden.  Therefore, the political drama was not fully explored, in addition to being predictable and boring.  On the other hand, the performance were great by everyone in the cast.  So, overall, five out of ten."
택배기사,Black Knight,2023,10,,"I express my opinion that the series is mighty, strong, and an artist. I rate the series 10/10 😍 It is considered one of the best series in 2023. It talks about intelligence and the region, Joy. It is a great series, and we benefited from the series and the hero's personality.  The series is luxurious in the full sense of the word, and it is considered a terrible series. I watched it, and I hope that a second installment will be released. The place like it is a place that teaches you about the atmosphere and oxygen.  And the character of Harami Ahni, frankly, is acting with accuracy and high quality, and there is no mistake, and about the political development of the region under the regimes, something terrible that teaches you about the future."
택배기사,Black Knight,2023,3,,"I gave up on this after 3 episodes.  The biggest problem may be the source, which I think is Manga. The needs of film and comic entertainment are so very different and this series fails to bridge the gap. Characters remain cardboard-thin. Dialogue lacks sparkle. Plenty of action, but often at the expense of depth in characters or plot.  Episode 3 is a case in point. Continuous fights as a youngster attempts to win the right to be a delivery man. But so what?! We all know he will win through, so there is no excitement, just blood and gore. It was that succession of meaningless blood letting that killed any lingering desire to stick with it."
택배기사,Black Knight,2023,10,,"Had to give this a 10 because of the underwhelming reviews on this show.  Although this dystopian setting didn't make much sense in the beginning, the setting came together piece by piece with every episode. Some people critiqued this and said it was convoluted and hard to follow, but I'd prefer having to use my brain a little than have it all spelled out for me.  6 episodes was a great length to keep it action-packed but long enough to learn more about the characters and experience this dysopian world. I would absolutely watch the second season if there ends up being one.  The actors were all great, the fighting choreography was clean and exciting, and the conflicts were unique. I always appreciate a solid villan."
택배기사,Black Knight,2023,2,,"It was excellently done in not making it obvious that it is a propaganda film.  Yes, they are correct about all the wrongs of fascism, including vaccines being made to make people more unhealthy/dead instead of the opposite, etc but in the process their solution is to promote the wrongs of communism.  Both communism and fascism are unfair forms of government. They both are totalitarianism.  Folk_egm was only correct about giving it a low score (which to me is still too high, 50%) but their listed reasons are complete lies.  In addition, comedy is a cultural thing for Koreans to help them cope. We could learn from that."
택배기사,Black Knight,2023,10,,"I recently watched Black Knight, that was an intense and thrilling experience. The drama follows the story of a group of skilled individuals who are on a dangerous mission. One of the highlights of this drama was the well-choreographed and executed action scenes, which were filled with close-quarters combat and hand-to-hand fighting. The fight scenes were fast-paced and intense, and they kept the tension high throughout the drama.  In addition to the action, the drama also had a diverse and interesting cast of characters. The main character 5-8 was a complex and well-developed individual who had a personal stake in the mission. The other characters were also well-written and had unique personalities that added to the overall story.  The drama's sound design was also impressive. The gunfire and fighting sounds were realistic and added to the overall intensity of the action scenes. The score was also well done, with a pulse-pounding beat that kept the audience on the edge of their seats.  Overall, this drama was an excellent example of an action drama that delivers on its promise of adrenaline-pumping excitement. Fans of the genre will definitely enjoy it, and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves a good action-packed thrill ride."
택배기사,Black Knight,2023,10,,"Black knight actually matched my expectations or we can say crossed it. At first I was a little confused. I was watching Black Knight in tv, so I was little scared what if suddenly a intimate scene comes up. Thankfully nothing happened, there was no intimate scene at all (that is also one of the reasons why I liked Black Knight) The actors who played lead role were all my fav...even the antagonist (I liked him from The Players kdrama) and the actor who played sa-wol (I liked him from light on me) and Sa-wol's elder sister (I liked her from Because this is my first life) and...KIM WOO BIN!!! I liked this sir from The Heirs. I would suggest this kdrama to my all kdrama friends."
택배기사,Black Knight,2023,5,,"Meh, it wasn't that impressive. The low budget CGI was painfully obvious. Felt pretty cheap at times. I thought the whole macho delivery man thing was a little corny. They probably could have thought that one through a little better. The plot was somewhat interesting. These Korean shows can be fun sometimes. Although, if it was any longer I probably wouldn't have bothered. This show would have greatly benefited from a bigger budget. Considering it released on Netflix, I'll be surprised if they renew it for a second season. If you got some time to burn go for it, otherwise you're not missing much."
택배기사,Black Knight,2023,10,,"Thats all. I like the acting of the main character, including the female soldier. It may seem a bit scientifically implausible, but fighting makes me excited. They showcase their strength. Even though there are fewer dramatic scenes, it's better than them dying after battling the villains.  Please make the fights more brutal. It's very intriguing, but the villains are pathetic. I'm frustrated watching them, and it's really curious why his fingers are moving. I hope he gets bombed all over his body.  I hope you appreciate the actors and actresses who have worked hard. Please refrain from overly harsh criticism."
택배기사,Black Knight,2023,8,,"I really enjoyed watching this series. Almost didn't give it a chance due to the low score on IMDB. Glad I didn't listen.  It's a well made dystopian action series. If you like Elysium, Equilibrium and other comparable movies you should give it a try. You should not expect the deepest story nor the most stunning visuals. But it certainly is more entertaining than a lot other overhyped Netflix series. That's what I am looking for if I watch a series like this: entertainment.  I binged it in two days which is very uncommon for me. This is also due to the fact that the episodes are relativelly short (for K-series standards), there are only 6 episodes and it is fast paced."
카터,Carter,2022,4,,"Editor: How many cuts & transitions do you want?  Director: Yes  Man! My head hurts and my eyes need some rest. Even though I do love these fast-paced action features, this turned out to be too much! I know and I understand that there would be some who have an undying appetite for such kinds of filmmaking, and that's fine, cause to each their own! But if you ask me, I could not enjoy the ride as much as I wished for.  Part of it is due to how turbulent & disorderly it had ultimately become! What was inaugurated as an inventive piece that comprises distinctive one-of-a-kind action, slowly turned itself into one tiring repetition. Add cheesy performances and a suboptimal write-up to that equation and we got ourselves a highly forgettable affair."
카터,Carter,2022,4,,"The film isn't about the plot the politics or the acting. It's about the action. In and of itself, despite some wonky parts that are just not believable, the action is decent.  But the whole thing is ruined by the attempt at a constant one take attempt constantly jostled about by the shaky camera effect.  If you mixed Kingsman camera movement and spinning and pov changing with Blair witch project handheld shaky cam footage it would be the camera work on this movie.  Absolutely unbearable after a certain point while you're just trying to focus on the action scenes unfolding.  Its worth a try if you think you can withstand that. Otherwise it's hard on the eyes and brain with the constant camera shake."
카터,Carter,2022,6,,"Director Jung has come to collect - in an exhausting, unwavering maelstrom of ambitious yet somehow derivative fist fights, shoot-outs, car chases and plane crashes, all shot with nauseating, nitrous-fuelled drones that appear caught in a perpetual tailspin. As a result, much of the action feels weightless and simulated, even when propped up by Won's insanely physical performance.  Carter is a protagonist for whom the laws of physics are merely a suggestion, and whose dramatic motivation is spoon-fed to him by inconsequential bit players between punch-ups, like cutscenes in a video game.  One time watch for the respect of Byung-gil Jung, who made The Villainess (2017)."
카터,Carter,2022,,,"The entire film is shot and made in a way that makes it look like a one-shot long take. But you can notice that there were lots of cuts because there are like 85% of the actions that were pretty insane, so that would be extremely impossible to shoot one long take lol.  It was Hardcore Henry type movie that had more actions, only the editing was kinda poorly done. Lots of cheap green screens and CGI, but doesn't bother me anyway. The actions sequences were actually pretty insane and impressive, IMO. The camerawork is kinda cool, but some people might find it annoying.  Would have been one of the best action films if it was shot in 4-6 long takes without green screens, for sure. Overall, I liked it, it's quite unique. Except Hardcore Henry, I've never seen any movies like this one."
카터,Carter,2022,2,,"Outrageously overused drone shots, really poor CGI, bad acting and terrible scripts and endless seizure inducing one-take shots then this is the film for you. I give it a two for trying to put up exciting action scenes, but all of the other things really detract from its overall watch-ability. And in all seriousness, if you are prone to seizures, skip this one."
카터,Carter,2022,4,,"The idea of this film was very promising and attention-grabbing, especially for lovers of action films and thrillers (for me!). However, the execution and direction of this film just weren't satisfying enough.  In the beginning of the story, I was already doubtful after seeing the sauna scene - ""Carter"", a single man with no memory, manages to kill over 20 (probably 30+) men, all with knives and other kinds of weapons, basically single-handedly and without a scratch. Even the best-trained killers wouldn't be that capable. The opening already tells you how the story will go. The action scenes are way too unrealistic, almost fantasy-like. For a film that's classified as an action thriller, that's not so good.  The one-scene one-cut technique used during the camera work was nice and refreshing at the beginning but later on became frustrating. A lot of ""empty"" scenes showing empty rooms, the underneath of a car etc...just absolutely unnecessary scenes.  The non-Korean actors ruined the show for me. Their acting was simply bad, very amateur-like and mediocre."
카터,Carter,2022,1,,"Epic fail at an attempt to create an action movie to seemingly have no cuts. The gimmick it aims for became its worst enemy, unfortunately. Im quite forgivable when it comes to action movies but this one just kept digging its own grave to the point where I'm literally laughing out loud and saying WTF.  ALTHOUGH maybe give this a shot while you're high AF or getting drunk with a bunch of friends, that might have actually been fun but sadly for me I came in watching dead sober with time to waste and this review is what I ended up doing instead. Apologies to those who worked hard on this movie but maybe next time make a comedy instead!"
카터,Carter,2022,7,,"THhis is like video game cutscenes that turn into a movie .. Great movie for some peoples , bad movie for those cannot accept this type of movie .. I think this movie is okay .."
카터,Carter,2022,1,,"This movie seems llike scenes from a FPS video game.  There are lots of actions but camera work is horrible that gives you motion sickeness, if that is your thing. The camera is constantly moving like there is no image stabilisation or is always panning or spinning. There is no consistent POV and it never focus on anything for more than 2 seconds even when someone is talking.  Storyline is rather uninteresting and a bit forced and unrealistic."
카터,Carter,2022,6,,"An absolute brilliant effort in cinematography and fight choreography, acting is perfectly adequate marriage with a typical action storyline.  High praise for what is visually presented it's wildly entertaining using creative action that plays comedic while never losing visceral impact.  If you love action films, this is your bag!"
카터,Carter,2022,1,,"This movie is ridiculous, but not in a good way. CIA, memory wipes, conflict between North and South Korea, bombs in teeth, a zombie plague (just a sloppy, minor element in a way too ambitious story) and stuck in the middle is a CIA agent who had plastic surgery and his memory erased to do the mission? The plot is muddy, and it doesn't help that each bit of exposition is explained at length, at least 3 times. This movie could have been an hour shorter, especially if it was going to be filmed in ""one take"" where the came NEVER stops moving. Story gets in the way of plot, special effects are jarring, and the cinematography makes you wanna puke. This one was rough to say the least."
카터,Carter,2022,9,,"Carter is a very ambitious film and the entire film has been shot as a ""oner"", thought sometimes the cuts are easily visible I appreciate the effort. The camera work is absolutely insane, and though the plot gets overshadowed by the action in this movie, the main reason you will be watching this movie is for the action and it absolutely delivers. Kudos to the entire team who worked on this cuz as a filmmaker myself it is absolutely clear that this was not an easy movie to execute and film and personally I think though this movie has its own share of flaws, they pulled off something incredible here."
카터,Carter,2022,4,,"Carter was a style over substance dizzying 132 minutes of utter ridiculousness, ruined by horrible camerawork and a convoluted story. Huge props to lead actor Joo Won, all the skilled stuntmen, insanely choreographed action scenes and the great action set pieces and visuals, but sadly, all that effort was wasted on unwatchable dizzying, seizure-inducing, single-take-looking headache-inducing camera work - and just as bad editing. Had all the great action and fight scenes been shot normally - with tact, intelligence, and aim, this film's action could've topped the Mission Impossible films. But instead, it was like a drunk on meth, with one fancy camera drone trying to keep up with the action. Then add a decent conceptual story, that ended up being incoherent and tried too hard to be smart with convoluted twists, and drag it out with unnecessarily repetitive long action scenes - for over 2 hours. It was frustrating, exhausting, and a huge missed opportunity to be a great action film. If you want to see it done properly - with great action and a great story, watch The Roundup with Don Lee. Writer and director Byung-gil Jung needs to stick to basic camera work and lessen the overbearing dramatics, as well as work towards better story-telling - in under 2 hours."
카터,Carter,2022,2,,"When some reviewers say that this movie isn't for everyone, boy, are they right. This is essentially footage of a 1st-person shooter video game. There is no story, and there's not even any redeeming fight action. You know the martial arts movies where the actors aren't good martial arts performers or lack skill, so they make up for it with shakey cam? This is that, on steroids."
카터,Carter,2022,4,,"The story is hilarious and the further the movie goes the worse it gets. Actually the beginning is pretty good and has some stylish scenes.  The main character is charismatic and delivers some good action......even though he almost never gets a hit, which is ridiculous.  Unfortunately the movie budget was clearly not very high, which doesn't help of course and makes the stupid story look even more ridiculous.  Carter is watchable if you don't think too much and don't mind the lack of professionalism.  In fact if they would have continued the way the movie started it wouldn't be so bad, but after ~ 45min everything goes down under.  4 out of 10 with tendency towards 3."
카터,Carter,2022,1,,"The action is overdone, CGI is terrible and camera work made me seasick.  Way too many scenes that didn't make any sense at all...and I am baffled as to why and how this movie has a review over 5?"
카터,Carter,2022,6,,"First the things most people want to know: The story takes some snippets from the Matrix, Resident Evil at different places. Switches between English and Korean (mostly Korean), is way to long, and because its non stop high energy action and motion from its opening scene, the final conflict and resolve of the story is nothing more than coming off this speed trip to normal paced reality and a cheesy last second unended conflict scene too suggest it might lead to a sequel or just as a teaser.  Only near the end did it start to get a little boring, mainly because every fathomable cinematography angle and technique ever conceived in film history ran out and had to be recycled.  From a cinematography and filmmaker perspective It is an amazing film to watch, because it uses all kinds of controlled speed manipulation, angles and unedited camera moves that'll make you ponder how it was done. Lots of amazing drone, crane, rail, and angle manipulations I have never seen before.  If you like resident evil, then you know what your getting except this would be the MA-13 or Unrated version.  Some of the acting, mainly by the English speaking cast is poor, what I would expect from a low budget production using inexperienced actors and actresses, but there is nothing low budget about this movie other than the poorly executed and stiff dialog.  A great movie presents a level of believable authenticity, even when not realistic. For the most part Carter pulls this off, despite fighting sequences that would be totally impossible and unrealistic. So it meets that objective.  I gave it a 6 star rating because of the visually interesting cinematography. If i rated it entirely on the story, i might give it a 5 or less because its not very original in concept.  The fact that it was filmed entirely in Korea was a good decision from a filmmaker perspective and it makes sense, because a majority of this movie could not be filmed with live stunt work in the USA due to safety limitations.  It's a decent lazy day weekend movie."
카터,Carter,2022,2,,"Cool idea to shoot such long single shot action scenes and really cool action ideas and stunt work.  There is some fun nudity at the beginning, too.  Unfortunately, although the continuous camera shots are cool, they are not smooth and they will give you a headache after just a couple of minutes. That is what makes it unwatchable. This type of movie doesn't need a plot, so no loss there.  Fun to watch in 1 minute segments if you are a camera operator or drone pilot."
카터,Carter,2022,7,,"Incredible action scenes, adrenalin all over the story, the entire movie is a one shot camera recording, who cares if the CGI is welding the frames ? Who cares if it looks like a video-game?? Very good entertainment movie, the main actor is great. Why assigning a low rating just because isn't a US movie ? Great Korean production."
카터,Carter,2022,1,,Not for me this movie though i'm a huge huge fan for 20yrs now of South Korean movie but i don't do stupid camcorder movies or first person video game style movies and this is one of them. I watched around 15mins and that was enough and came here and now realise why the rating is so low and it deserves to be.
카터,Carter,2022,8,,"It's all in the editing and camerawork.  This was an insane ride, using FPV drones, ""one-take""-editing (the cuts are in the pans and zooms), practical effects and various techniques, relying very little on CGI.  I have never seen actionscenes (and there are many) shot and presented this way before and the only thing that prevents 'Carter' from becoming a classic and a masterpiece is that the STORY is so-so and rather generic."
카터,Carter,2022,7,,"Of special effects. It's an action film and it delivers. If you're looking for an action film that delivers on amazing special effects, then this is it.  It is what it is and you can't say anything else about it, really."
카터,Carter,2022,1,,This was just...a complete trainwreck.  Nothing worked here.  The cinematography was one of the worst I've seen in years.  The rest followed suite.  A total trainwreck of a movie.
카터,Carter,2022,1,,Realy dispointed from the way it ends and the actors deserve better directing . It was like watching a video game without playing it . The begginig of the movie was ok but then they used too much CGI and really.
카터,Carter,2022,3,,"This movie is defenitly creative and original. The story is great and probably inspired by covid-19 and theories of conspiration. The dialogue is a bit childish at times. But there are some great scenes in this movie. I have never seen anything like it, and I will probably not watch anything like it again. Sometimes the movie looks like a computergame espsecially towards the ending.  3 stars for the effort."
카터,Carter,2022,7,,"As ""Carter"" (2022 release; from South Korea; 134 min) opens, we learn that a COVID 19-like virus has originated in the Korean DMZ, with devastating effects on South Korea and the US. Dr. Jung may have found a cure but is missing. We are introduced to Carter, a guy who has lost his memory and whom the CIA thinks is connected to Dr. Jung. The CIA decides to pay a visit to Carter.... At this point we are less than 10 min into the movie.  Couple of comments: this is the latest from up-and-coming Korean writer-director Jung Byung-gil (""The Villainess""). Here he concocts a wild and crazy story that gets even wilder and crazier in its implementation onto the screen. How? By using the longest single-take shots you will ever see, coming and going from impossible to phantom angles on top of that. The overall feel is more of a video game than a movie, but for some reason I was really up for it. To state that there are lot of action scenes would be the understatement of the year, as the movie goes from one action sequence to another, and each time you think it can't get any crazier, it just does. I kept thinking that this is the Korean equivalent of Mission Impossible meets The Fugitive meets Mad Max, but on steroids. Yes, it is that much 'over the top' but in a fun way (of course not if seeing non-stop carnage is not your cup of tea). ""Carter"" would've been better served with a shorter running time (I ended up watching the movie in two parts over two evenings). Bottom line: there is no need to worry about the Byzantine plot. Just sit back, relax, and enjoy one of the zaniest action movies that I have ever see in my lifetime.  ""Carter"" premiered this past weekend on Netflix, and I read a mildly positive review of it in the NYT. That was enough for me to seek it out. Very glad I did. If you are in the mood for an over the top actions movie that needs to be seen in order to be believed, I'd readily suggest you check it out, and draw your own conclusion."
카터,Carter,2022,2,,"The story of the movie almost doesn't exist. The movie is 2 hours fighting, with bollywood like special affect. On top of it, the camera works is so bad it is difficult to follow what is happening."
카터,Carter,2022,1,,Way too much camera movement gives you a headache. Trying new things doesn't mean harass your audience. Way too much camera movement gives you a headache. Trying new things doesn't mean harass your audience.
카터,Carter,2022,8,,"Tons of blood and hacking up bodies. I'm glad I didn't listen to the lower rated reviews. Some of the dialogue is cheesy in the beginning, but it's only when they speak English. I recommend watching in Korean w/English subs. There are some parts where bullets just seem to miss the protagonist as if by luck, but more importantly you don't know who the real baddie is until the end.  The fight/action scenes are pretty cool. And the camera work shows a ton of effort to do oneshots and camera pans. It very much reminds me of Hardcore Henry, but with less CGI and tons of actual dronecam shots.  This movie has all kinds of layers, and tbh I was on the edge of my seat throughout. If you're prone to motion sickness or seizures, I wouldn't recommend. For any others, this movie is a winner in my book.  Once again, it's very bloody/gory, and mad shaky cam. Not for the faint of heart."
카터,Carter,2022,7,,"Carter: A South Korean SpyFi/Zombie movie. Carter (Joo Won) wakes up suffering from amnesia and immediately has to fight off assassins but there's an implant in his ear which gives him advice, he ends up fighting the CIA, South Korean Agents and elements of NK Intelligence, but is he working for another wing of NK Intelligence, maybe he's a rogue CIA agent. Meanwhile a Zombie plague has devastated North Korea and the US but South Korea has done ok. Some great action sequences worthy of Mission Impossible and James Bond made all the better as the helicopter battles and skydiving stunts are done for real without CG. Beautifully choreographed fight scenes where Cartet battles dozens of assassins hand to hand and great chase sequences involving trains, planes and automobiles. The Zombies are pretty savage, they even come at you when they have been set alight literally rising from a mass grave, the Zombie breakout in a clinic and subsequent fighting is superb. The plot perhaps gets a bit too complicated for it's own good and the running time of 132 minutes could have safely shed 15 minutes, even non-stop action can be overdone, could also have done with more Zombie scenes but certainly worth watching. Written & Directed by Jung Byung-gil. On Netflix. 6.5/10."
카터,Carter,2022,3,,"I didn't see a disclaimer for seizure causing strobing. So, if you're susceptible to seizures, you may want to skip it. It's a 2 dimensional film. No character building. It should appeal to gamers as that's what this movie feels like, a video game. The plot is okay, but the non stop flashing and camera jerk and jiggle with the first, second, third person angles had me feeling seasick with a splitting headache. I had to stop watching after 40 minutes. The body count is high as the ""bad"" guys are dispatched like in a video game.  If a camera were strapped to the bow of a ship on choppy seas, you'd have a similar effect. The action pauses for information updates or supplies, just like a video game, then jumps back into the frenetic action."
카터,Carter,2022,1,,Story starts thirteen days in and with an attempted capture of carter.... It doesn't make sense that the voice didn't wake him up before.. Add excessive blood where it should not be and the story is incredible... incredible meaning that you don't believe it.  What is left is an updated version of the infamous hard-core Henry. I say infamous because it wasn't good at all.  South Korea have a bunch of talented directors and scriptwriters. I won't add these to my list.  Itmight be more geared towards those who loved squid game. Squid game is one of the lesser South Korean shows I saw.  The dialogue is as bad as it gets...
카터,Carter,2022,2,,"The film is good, but the camera pisses me off and makes the film feel cheap. Like watching a video game. So I feel, I'm watching a movie or playing a video game. The camera moves too much and makes it weird and makes the film unpleasant."
카터,Carter,2022,7,,"Decent film, cast and interesting story. All questions will not be answered but you will be on the edge of your seat for this 2 hour action adventure. I was highly entertained."
카터,Carter,2022,4,,"I wanted this movie to be good. But the movie was over CGI'ed. The camera work and editing was all over the place. Hope South Korean action movies stay using practical effects like Man From Nowhere, I Saw the Devil and Oldboy."
카터,Carter,2022,7,,"The movie feels like the director thought about adapting his best run at Modern Warfare into a movie. It seems they have a lot of cool looking action sequences in mind and decided to put it together on the big screen before having a scenario at hand.  Disposable bad guys that wait in line to get killed? Check.  Invisible voice that provide clue to get to the next stage? Check.  Car chase? Yes. Motorcycle chase? Yes. Motorcycle/bus/cas/airplane fight scene? Double check!  Indiana Jones suspended rope bridge hommage? Check.  Zombi? Yeah!  This Korean flick do not reinvent the wheel, but it spin it quite fast! The only thing it lack to be a great B movie its one liner. However, It is very entertaining if you like movies like Jason Bourne and Extraction. I had a good time!  Oh I forgot, don't worry about things like gravity, physics and skin burnt for driving motorcycle barefoot lol."
카터,Carter,2022,1,,Unrealistic childish action scenes. Lacked substance. Dragged on longer than it needed to be.  Every scene was identical to the one before. Definitely ran out of ideas.
카터,Carter,2022,7,,"The special effects and camera work of this movie are magnificent and may well serve as a special effects library for action movies to come as I got the impression quite a few of them were pretty new and experimental. But as with too many orgasms in a short period of time, they wear you out. There should be some time at least after a fourth orgasm or so to get to know more about other aspects of the relation. But this movie doesn't give you the time to get more into the different characters, the whole story and the plots and sub-plots. Life hangs on a thread, be it from a building, a racing car, a helicopter, a motor, a rope bridge or a plane, no time to get into romance, character development or relation between the different countries that have an interest in what is happening.  Even the very end of the movie doesn't let you hit the stop button with a feeling that it's over, that all ends well. The movie goes on, that's for sure. You get no rest.  All in all, an outstanding movie where the action, camera work and special effects is concerned, but after a good orgasm or so, I like to also look at the other side of heaven and unfortunately this movie drains your energy too much to totally enjoy the full ride."
카터,Carter,2022,2,,"This is totally a movie from a shooter video game, with high CGI & camera movements. I did not enjoy it and won't recommend it unless you have nothing better to do than just watch a high-paced chase and graphic killing."
카터,Carter,2022,1,,"Tragic tragic tragic.. awful movie, not directed well, most probably was filming by a drone (it makes me dizzy), the plot is confusing and does not even make sense.. nothing good really!"
카터,Carter,2022,1,,"Terrible directing, terrible acting, low budget, and couldn't watch long enough to get an idea of the plot. The director attempts to hide his lack of skill and intelligence with over the top violence, nudity, and chaotic action sequences with gimmicky camera angles. Feels like what happens when you put a 12 year old in charge of a $5 million dollar budget movie. A whole lot of people should get fired for this garbage."
카터,Carter,2022,1,,"So, don't get me wrong. Action is great, and the Koreans tried something new.  But if you have watched previous Korean movies, whenever they put American actors, they pretty much tend to fail in acting. It doesn't look natural.. it feels like Steven Seagal's B rated movie type of acting.  Netflix invested in the wrong movie."
카터,Carter,2022,7,,"I think some of the reviewers missed the point that this film was meant to look like a video game.  Not a masterpiece, by any means, and sometimes dizzying, but non-stop action and fascinating camera work. And some of the stunts are incredible.  Definitely a brainless, but very enjoyable ride."
카터,Carter,2022,4,,"Love the ink and 100% respect to the physical endurance I saw for 12 minutes. Takes dedication and hard work to look like that. However the acting is brutal and there's just to much. Way over the top and creepy. Maybe that's what the intentions but It didn't capture our immersion. Tried watching 2x but, just couldn't."
카터,Carter,2022,7,,"So as a lot of reviewers have said, this type of movie definitely won't be for everyone. But in all honesty, if like me you're a big fan of action then this is a pretty fun film to watch through.  Sure, some of the camera work could be better, and the cgi in some scenes is very obviously cgi, but I did find it quite clever for a lot of scenes how they managed to film in a 'continuous take', and although it does kind of feel like a video game as others have mentioned, I wouldn't say that's necessarily too much of a bad thing as the action is still pretty entertaining throughout.  Overall I don't think this movie deserves such a low score, if you're into action you'll like it. 7/10."
카터,Carter,2022,1,,"Creator's of this movie are like Monkey's got some skills to use. Skills in wrong hands. The story, the logics can even be better wrote by 5 year old kid."
카터,Carter,2022,10,,"Wow just wow.a new generation action saga.well choreographed action sequences, outstanding cinematography.climax just fire.a visual delight.seat edge thriller."
카터,Carter,2022,7,,"I scored it a 7 because of some technical aspects. The story got lost in me, it's just an excuse to make an insane action movie. The whole movie looks like you're in a first person game. At some moments in the film, the CGI changes the normal faces is game-like faces. This reverse enhancement looks kind of cool. The action scenes in the movie are really over the top and kept me watching, because I kept wondering: how are they doing this? It's like a James Bond and Jackie Chan, both in one and on a speed trip. Too much if you ask me, but it is certainly high speed. Better acting and a better story could have saved this movie to become an 8."
카터,Carter,2022,1,,"Bad story line, poor one shot take, fighting scene is almost always the same style. Making it almost like a game in 3rd person view causing lots of giddiness."
카터,Carter,2022,1,,"Sucks!  Just puts this into worst list whole film takes dont this freaky flying camera shots. Thats litteraly headache.  There are lots of actions but camera work is horrible that gives you motion sickeness, if that is your thing. The camera is constantly moving like there is no image stabilisation or is always panning or spinning. There is no consistent POV and it never focus on anything for more than 2 seconds even when someone is talking.  Storyline is rather uninteresting and a bit forced and unrealistic.  When some reviewers say that this movie isn't for everyone, boy, are they right. This is essentially footage of a 1st-person shooter video game. There is no story, and there's not even any redeeming fight action. You know the martial arts movies where the actors aren't good martial arts performers or lack skill, so they make up for it with shakey cam? This is that, on steroids."
카터,Carter,2022,2,,"The idea of one continuous take is not new. However, there are signs in the movie where they try hard to stitch together cuts with cgi and it's very obvious. Usually with quick panning and blurry visuals done in post. The idea is fine but it really doesn't add much to the movie.  What made it worse is the overall camera work. Sometimes it doesn't make much sense. We all know shaky cams during action scenes like fighting or running on foot. Gives the audience the feeling of being there dodging punches or running away from a bad guy chasing you. But they do the shaky cam even in car chases. Why is it shaking? Am I running after a car or a motorcycle at 50mph?  Next is the constant spinning. It was way overused. Half the movie it we're just spinning in circles. I had to turn it off because it started giving me motion sickness. It does not add to the movie in any way, shape, or form.  The story was mediocre at best. I didn't care for any of the characters as there was pretty much zero character building aside from the lead.  Definitely would not recommend."
카터,Carter,2022,7,,"This is a stunning achievement in terms of stunts, visual effects and cinematography- there really isn't anything like this in Hollywood at the moment!  The action barely lets up in its running time, each scene seamlessly blending into the next - at times it's hard to keep up as the camera swoops around scenes with the mix of real locations and CGi based sets.  It's not perfect - it's too long, the camerawork is a little overdone in places, and the CGI is inconsistent at times.  It's an amazing visual spectacle with some amazing choreography and a plot that is a little bizarre and quite unbelievable!"
카터,Carter,2022,5,,"All in all movie is pretty decent - a lot of action, great choreography, somewhat interesting plot (although a bit too much in my opinion - memory wipes, secret spies, ""zombies"", killer virus, ugh) but all of that is ruined by bad CGI (sometimes it's REALLY BAD) and terrible, terrible camera work. Attempts to make it like Hardcore Henry (one-take action shots) just simply doesn't work here - all this overuse of drone cameras and shakeness of the image makes your head hurt. I managed to watch the whole movie without having to pause to let my eyes rest a little (looking at you, Resident Evil The Final Chapter) but it was hard. If you are a diehard action movie fan then yes - you should watch it if you don't mind mild acting and bad CGI and atrocious camera work."
카터,Carter,2022,6,,"This film is pure action, only action as the plot is silly, obvious and full of holes, the characters are tasteless and almost unnecessary, but the film entertains for the continuous action that never stops from the first to the last minute, with a very frenetic direction to accentuate the action. The film is therefore only action and nothing else."
카터,Carter,2022,5,,"Straight to the point it might be a video game action concept?  Camera movements is kinda cool but give so much seizures and dizzy to watch , like drone action camera action thing? Wth.  AND , CGI are not that good."
카터,Carter,2022,8,,Some wrote that this is like being in a first person shooter. And it definitely is. The story is super thin but who cares when the action takes you over again and again. I'm sure there is CGI involved but some of the stunts are absolutely not fake and will definitely make you grab hold of your seat or whatever is close to you. Enjoy!
카터,Carter,2022,,,"This movie is 100% insane action, barely time to breath, simple story ... but with fantastic camera work, loved every second of this great action movie, Korean style! Awesome work by all people involved."
카터,Carter,2022,6,,"Not atrocious- most definitely watchable. Not heavy on woke themes (which is a serious plus). Choreography (fighting) is choppy, could be better, but is not silly. Plot is typical for action film (which is basically what it is). It's worth watching if you want to escape in an action flick."
카터,Carter,2022,4,,"If you want to watch just nonstop fight scene after fight scene, then this is your flick.  The movie starts fast with very little introduction. Sometimes that works and sometimes it doesn't. In this case, it doesn't. The intent of this movie, in my opinion, was to get as much action as they could out of Joo Won. There is very little character building, very little substance, and almost no story building.  The one thing that this movie DOES have is lots and lots and LOTS of action sequences. The drone camera usage that they constantly use takes some time to get used to. The constant spinning of the camera, the upside down angles, the 360 panned views, the slowing down and speeding up definitely is an adjustment that the viewer has to make on the fly.  The movie is a good choice if you want Korean subtitles and crazy amounts of fight scenes. It's a pass if you want something with substance.  Overall I give it a 4/10. For the creativeness with the camera and the non stop GO GO GO action. Worth a watch if you have nothing else to watch and have a couple hours to burn."
카터,Carter,2022,1,,I try to keep it short. I threw 2 hours of my life in the trash. If you read reviews here that are positive! Is that such a lie that you should be punished for it? Even if u are fan from trash movies .. I'm at a loss for words. I would even recommend bollywood films more than this random nonsense. Cheap cgi that my 12 year old son can do better. Puhhh I'm not used to something like that from Korean films.. Maybe it was filmed and produced by North Korea 😂
카터,Carter,2022,1,,"Turned it off after 20 minutes. Don't know if the look is overprocessed digital or bad animation. Either way, garbage film. There is just so much suspension of disbelief you can expect. This film is way, way over the top. It's ridiculous and poorly done. Not entertaining."
카터,Carter,2022,1,,"Worst spent time ever. What's the point of making such stupid movie? No plot, no actor play, nothing but blood.  Some should be punished for making this ""movie""..."
카터,Carter,2022,6,,I gave it a 6/10 because honestly the action scenes were absolutely amazing but everything else fell flat From the trailer and from everything that was on social media I thought this was going to be like Vagabond. I was disappointed. I wanted to be captivated and pulled in by the story and then have the action be the whip cream and the cherry on top but there was nothing. That being said watch it for the action scenes know that there's not much else. If you want to see a really good action one watch Vagabond.
카터,Carter,2022,3,,Very bad photography. Annoying Camera moves with very bad lighting. And you can tell that is very fake. Even the choreography is poor. I am sure they have spent a lot of money to make the film but it's really bad. Even the special effect are poor.
카터,Carter,2022,7,,"Watch and enjoy action but don't expect any story or logic. The thin plot is not logical and the survival of heroes is God like. But action, action, action!"
카터,Carter,2022,10,,"This is a ground breaking movie.  Just watch it and decide for yourself.  All of the ""bad acting"" or Plot whatever are subjective.  Compare this to Gray Man. Does Gray Man have any new plot?  Carter is far superior in its action scenes and the plot is good enough for this kind of action movie.  Watch it and you won't be disappointed."
카터,Carter,2022,6,,"... I enjoyed it more than I thought. Clever, almost captivating, cinematography. The craziest most OTT action scenes and people you sort of care about. It's bonkers but I've seen worse."
카터,Carter,2022,1,,"41 minutes is all I could handle. Horrible acting, horrible cgi, just straight up horrible. I was saying it while I was watching, this looks and sounds like it was chopped together with clips from a video game, then laughed when someone mentioned it in their review."
카터,Carter,2022,1,,"This is such a poorly made movie by Netflix. Exaggerated action scenes , weird camera movements that'll make you dizzy, really bad acting acting, inexistent story line, etc. This is just a movie to be avoided, just a waste of time. I dropped this one."
카터,Carter,2022,1,,This was horrible to watch. The erratic camera movement took away the fun of watching the movie. They tried to make a movie which feels like a continuous shot but failed miserably (A poor 'Hardcore Henry' knockoff).  A line should be drawn at how much action sequences should be packed in a movie. There were action after action going on and on and on. And its the same type of fighting happening for tens of minutes straight. It got boring to watch very soon.  Story is weird and direction is bad. This will definitely cause seizure to some people so be cautious and better yet skip it and save some time.
카터,Carter,2022,6,,"This movie is deliberately over the top, but some people seem to have a problem with that. It lets you know in the first ten minutes you're in for a wild, wacked-out, violent action movie. It doesn't pretend to be anything else. And I liked it for this reason.... Everybody believes Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan can take on dozens of people at a time, without a scratch. But this movie is silly for it? If you want a movie that doesn't care about your sense of taste or what you consider realistic... than you will like this movie. It's completely over the top, unrealistic, and nuts... but it's also entertaining and breaks the mold of typical action movies.  I for one don't ever want to watch Jason Statham as an action hero... that's ridiculous!"
카터,Carter,2022,4,,"A lot of action. As in, probably one of the action-filled movies out there.  However it's filled with what seems like scenes filmed with a 15fps camera with no stabilization so for over 2 hours you are looking at very shaky cam that shakes and moves too fast to see what is happening. Half of the scenes are blurry. Other half are just full of 0-G grafity defying stunts with CGI and fake-one-cam-scenes(again shaky). To the point where, my cell phone records a less shaky camera and I wouldn't be able to do that even if I wanted it too.  0/10 for camera work and directing 3/10 for story. Nothing made sense 5/10 for CGI 6/10 for trying to be innovative how movies are shot.  It is sad the director was too inexperienced and unable to record the movie in a more pleasing manner."
카터,Carter,2022,9,,"Everything I love in an action movie is in this. Cars, choppers, trains, high speed chasing, body count, superb choreography, hand-to-hand combat sequences, crazy amount of money. You just gotta love Korean cinema."
카터,Carter,2022,7,,"The sequences, the camera angles and the rithm of the first 10 minutes of this film should be studied in art school. I think they used drones, some great editing and phehaps some great CGI, but the problem with this movie is that the script is the most confusing and nosense thing that you will ever see. The spectator gets tired trying to understand what the story is about, the script is all over the place and it ruins what could be a action cult movie. To make matters worse the dubbing of the movie just sounds horrible, they should just used Corean. I hope this director has another change, this time please, please HIRE SOME GOOD WRITERS!!!"
카터,Carter,2022,2,,"This movie poor. Poor camera work, poor photography, fake decors, chaotic 'effects', camera moves over-exagerated and not fluent at all .. too much effects kills the effect, in this case less would be more. This movie feels fake, and so it is."
카터,Carter,2022,3,,"I couldn't take more than 20 minutes of this turkey. Extremely over-the-top action, where the ""hero"" is an unstoppable killing machine who mows down everybody in his way, physics be damned.  The ""missing memory"" trope really gets old in this effort. The fact that the hero just eats up all the BS fed to him over the earpiece (Yet Another Overused Trope) makes him appear even stupider -- if that's possible.  As mentioned in other reviews, the CGI is iffy at best, and the stupidity of the guy just waltzing into situations where he should have been dead ten times over is hard to ignore. Look, I don't mind a little suspension of disbelief for a Mission:Unlikely movie or something, but this thing is just plain bad.  Avoid if you value your time."
카터,Carter,2022,3,,"It looked an interesting film, and I'm quite a fan of Korean cinema so sat down to give it a watch. After a few minutes I was thinking ""hmmm this director has used ALL the angles they learned at college."" 15minutes later I gathered they was going for a ""One shot"" movie but holy S#%t the cuts and use of drone/cgi was extremely gratuitous.  So it's a John Wick or Hardcore-esque action flick with some virus nonsense side plot, however you see from the very first fight the main character is involved in that he is NEVER in danger, The opening fight scene is ""Carter"" naked fighting circa 30-60 gangsters with bladed weapons and not a single cut on him, additionally they had him down as a CIA agent and I think they got CIA agent mixed up with like the elite of the elite soldiers. The other CIA agents that have clear shots at him from 10meters away miss wildly and so I can only guess they didn't get the same training.  I tried to soldier on through with the movie, accepting that this is the style they are going for and the hero is godlike but there was nothing to enjoy from the movie so I ended up having to turn it off.  The editing is in the fashion of a one shot but changes angles so often it almost feels like ""Taken"" or ""Bourne Identity"" levels of incoherence."
카터,Carter,2022,6,,The action in combination with the camerawork was too much sometimes. The story is quite complicated and a lot of twists but it's a solid action flick. Adreneline rush as promised.
카터,Carter,2022,3,,"South Korean cinema, normally one of my favourites, but this time what a disappointment. It started all promising though, looked like it was going to be a spectacular and entertaining action movie, especially with the very different camera work. For quite a long time I would have scored it a seven, even if it was obvious that our local hero is unkillable, but that's a thing we're used to in this kind of action movies. But then the action scenes became so exaggerated that it got really annoying to watch, almost unwatchable. I get it that some reviewers didn't like the camera work, it was sometimes a bit sickening, but overall I thought this was the best thing about Carter. The story on the other hand is beyond ridiculous. You have to see it to fully understand. Action scenes that only would make sense if you were playing a videogame. And that's the feeling you sometimes get with this movie, that you're just watching somebody play a game. A game that I would play though, but as a movie it's a big no-no. There are plenty of passages that looked completely fake and that was also annoying. The acting was passable, that wasn't the problem. The longer the movie the lower my ratings got. From seven to six to five to four to three and that's just because of the spectacular camera angles. There's obviously going to be a sequel, definitely one I won't watch."
카터,Carter,2022,6,,"To start with the positive, I thought the way it was shot, as though trying to look like a continuous shot was interesting and well done. Some of the choreography made it seem like it was going to be a really good action film. However, as the movie continues, it becomes clear that they essentially ripped off Hardcore Henry and Shoot 'Em Up.  What really started to make the movie take a bad turn was eventually, the dialogue started to get really cheesy, like a bad voiceover of an old Godzilla movie. Add to that, some really CGI explosions and fire and it takes away from the film. It's as though they blew the budget on the editing and had a 12 year old add fire."
카터,Carter,2022,5,,"After the 1000th person got killed I was wondering when this will end.  Ultimately, a little boring toward the last third. Clever scenarios, interesting camera work and impossible but generally impressive stunts. But it goes on and on and on with a plot which is simplistic and sometimes confusing.  A primary issue was rickety camera work. Sometimes it was smooth, but much of the time shot stabilization wasn't implemented. Then combine this with the bizarre use of dropped frames, you get a highly annoying view of the action which often obscured the reading of what was going on.  Sure, have some crazy shaky hand held, but give the audience a rest with a higher proportion stable action images between the shaky parts.  It's an impressive effort but style was getting in the way of clarity."
카터,Carter,2022,9,,"If you're an action film fan watch this. The action is superb and I mean it. Very long sequences done as single shot action and its superb, violent and bonkers at the same time. Some of the camera movements are off the chart.  However, the film is let down by some dodgy acting, a bit of cheap cgi, way overlong in the 'dramatic plot' bits and ,strangely, some dodgy camera work in them.  Shot as a 'one take' movie but the director just gave up in the drama segments not even hiding the 'cuts' and saved his budget for the action. And what action it is!  Grab a beer or two and watch it for the truly sublime and, yes, bonkers action.  I hope action fans discover this and ignore the seriously low rating.  This is a film for action fans."
카터,Carter,2022,5,,"Not sure what they were trying to achieve with the camera angles and movement but 40 minutes into the film, I almost puked and had to stop watching. Its like Blair Witch Project. They could have settled for a conventional and smooth cinematography, but no. They seem to want to achieve something but failed. The intolerable cruelty of sacrificing viewer welfare by tormenting them with dizzying camera movements is unforgivable. The desperate attempt to stitch scenes and create a continuous shot was unsuccessful, it made me want to puke. And the American and Korean extras' acting especially during action scenes? Insufferable.  Good plot and action sequences though. But no, wont go back to finish the film."
카터,Carter,2022,3,,"Stupidity, indeterminate shots, crap cinematography, no plot to speak of... and yeah, Camilla Belle really needed a pay check. If you.re going to copy other films, at least do it well. This fails on all counts. Avoid it at all costs."
카터,Carter,2022,1,,"Looks and feels like a video game. Amazing action cut with brief exposition. Not a satisfying watch, 'couldn't finish it. I checked out when they used pigs to block motor vehicles. I know it's CGI but it's still a bit sick. Not for me."
카터,Carter,2022,2,,Roller coaster of fighting scenes without respite. Almost like a VR RPG experience. Had to rest a few times to complete watching.... I could spend the time better with PC/mobile game. Poor!
카터,Carter,2022,7,,"Loads of action in this film and a big body count. The story was in it as well. Why someone ever decided to film it with drones and the picture is constantly moving, I have no idea. Hopefully someone can re-edit the film so it's a lot more still."
카터,Carter,2022,2,,"Plot is almost non existent Those drone shots are so distracting to know what is going on.  The camera work is bad, trying to one take everything with those Kingsman shot, but not even close to their level.  It hurts my head just watching this movie, this is the worst movie experience of the year for me hands down."
카터,Carter,2022,7,,"First off these types of insane action movies are my favourites the raid 1-2, kill bill, we come for the night, crank 1-2, old boy, upgrade, atomic blonde, John wick etc so this was a natural fit for me as I was super hungover when I put it on. The action is some of the best I've seen lately with wild gore how brutal the fights get and the speed at which it's done but is sadly let down to the camera being controlled by a cat with a Xbox controller other then that is a solid movie!!  Also why didn't he take her ear speaker on the bus that would've made sense?"
카터,Carter,2022,1,,Dont waste your time watching this movie the ending is horrendous the cgi is absolutely horrific close range hand combat was sick but that is the only thing good about this movie.
카터,Carter,2022,8,,"If you know what you are letting yourself in for (i.e. Mindless action, quite a bit of splatter and extremely cool cinematography) then this is it! The story is a bit haphazard and incoherent, but puts you right in the action and doesn't let you down or even breathe at times! Carter would love to be seen as one continuous shot, but the editing falls short at times. However, the cinematography effortlessly switches between life action and CGI (which is noticeable at times), but it doesn't take anything away from the fun the editors must have had putting all the scenes together. And yes, it feels like playing a slightly too long and repetitive video game, but you are still breaking the high score, it's engaging and a lot of fun!"
카터,Carter,2022,6,,"Where do I begin.  Half the movie was filmed with go pros and drones. And the rest was green screen compositing.  The movie was ""one take"" where the camera does not stop or cut throughout the entire movie (but it does) they filmed it in such a way where you can purposely notice the cut and to eliminate some noticeable cuts, they dropped the frame rate to about 15-20 FPS. Where normal is 25-30 - it's just the style they aimed at. I wasn't a big fan of that style one take shot.  The movie made me nauseous and my right eye began to hurt. I'm not sure why my right one but it did.  The action would not stop which tired my brain a lot. There was to much information and was hard to process, hence why I got dizzy and my eye.  The ridiculous rating is a PHENOMENAL 10/10 - they should win an award for the most ridiculous movie made in history. It trumps the fast and furious franchise lol.  BUT due to the ridiculous level it made it fun to watch and could be classed as a comedy in some countries."
카터,Carter,2022,1,,"Could not find the proper words to tell/write how bad is this. I understand that Asian taste is different, but c'mon what is this??? A really bad video game, with poor CGI??  They found out this 'epic' horizontal three vehicles action platform, and they thoght its so unique it re-appears in every 10 minutes.  Zero star don't waste your time."
카터,Carter,2022,5,,"There are two main reasons for watching Carter, and the plot isn't one of them: the story is a confusing and forgettable mess, involving CIA agents, a deadly virus, tension between North and South Korea and a protagonist who has had his memory erased. No..the real reasons people will be checking this one out are the incredible 'one shot' direction (any joins hidden in editing), which sees the camera whirling in and around the frenetic action, and the amazingly over-the-top violence, countless bad guys dying in painful and bloody ways.  This kind of thing has been done before in Hotel Inferno and Hardcore Henry, with Hotel Inferno keeping matters to a snippy 80 minutes, but Hardcore Henry struggling at 96 minutes (the film also suffering from a weak plot). At over two and a quarter hours, Carter really outstays its welcome, despite upping the ante with each successive action scene. The clever technical camerawork is undeniably impressive, but it's not enough to hold one's attention for such a long time. To be honest, it all starts to get a bit boring...  So despite such wonderful moments as a bath-house battle that becomes a literal bloodbath, a fight that takes place between three vans moving at high speed, and an audacious finalé that features totally preposterous yet highly entertaining helicopter flying (achieved by some not very convincing CGI), Carter isn't quite the blistering adrenaline rush I was looking for: checking to see how much of the film is left is never a good sign."
카터,Carter,2022,1,,"It was the worse movie ever!  Just blood, and lots of fake action moves.  Imaginary moves were even worse than in Bollywood movies.  They even didn't notice to details."
카터,Carter,2022,3,,"I turned the movie off halfway through so I hope you can see by this mini review why I felt the need to do so, I am used to better film from Korea having watched for over 30 or so years....  I definitely give Byung Gil and all involved kudos for trying something different if a little ""Hardcore Henry"", unfortunately frame rate stutters, 70's style sped up vehicles and whatnot make the overall movie cheap.  Then the vertigo felt throughout the entire movie ends up getting more annoying and tiring than ""cool"".  Sadly sian cinema has been stereotyped to death with the western quality of actors they still get involved with as seen here from the intro. Mike Colter and Camilla Belle are fine but the rest of the western actors involved stick out like a sore thumb...  I think while doing something unique (ish?) the director forgot about including what should be standard in any film, a decent plot and if using a standard feasible story overall to still keep it reasonable believable.  Every action film doesn't need the ""fast and the furious"" in it.....or to be a video game either.  Sadly a turn off for me..."
카터,Carter,2022,6,,10star Actor:10 star 🎥:0 Star cause make me so dizzy  If they making for second part make sure dont use that kind of camera 🎥 taking action. The movie like cheap budget movie making not worth my time to watch it most of the fight part i skip cause me headache too much.
카터,Carter,2022,4,,"I have to admit, there are some amazing scenes that make you wonder how it was done, like the way The Matrix awed us with groundbreaking special effects long ago. However, it's a non-stop headache-inducing sequence of fight and chase scenes one after another, with handheld and drone camera work under constant motion that can be nauseating for some.  The fight and chase scenes are pretty amazing, reminiscent of John Wick, Bourne and Apocalypo in some ways, but with far less polished editing. I wish there was more story here with dialog, but it's just feels all over the place. It's more like a showcase of what can be achieved technically and cinematically than a complete movie. And perhaps the chaotic sequences can be attributed to the story's premise, but that would be a poor rationale. The story is just poorly developed. Some reviewers compared this to a video game, but there are video games that have far better storytelling.  Par for the course with English speaking actors in foreign films are the terrible actors, delivering terrible performances, as if they are reading from cue cards. You can usually ignore this in most foreign movies, but in Carter, English spoken roles and lines are a significant portion of the film.  Watch this if you are an adrenaline junky, and want to see some incredible action sequences. Otherwise, You'd be better off skipping it. This is not the best example of what Korean cinema can produce."
카터,Carter,2022,6,,"Many many agree, but the audacity of filling start to end with action should be applauded, agreed its not very believable but if you love action you won't mind.."
카터,Carter,2022,4,,Carter is an almost nonstop over-the-top action movie. The action scenes are really great and innovative. The plot is ok.  BUT this is the first time that I asked myself the question: Can there be too much violence in a movie?  Actually I think Carter is too violent. This is where I draw the line. More violence does not mean more entertaining.
카터,Carter,2022,10,,No boring only action plus many thing's saved for sequel I guess The movie was great my expectations was low but the movie blew my mind.  I enjoyed the movie while watching I didn't expect too much action I loved camera work.
카터,Carter,2022,6,,"The action is pretty impressive, aside from a few bits that just arent physically possible and obviously badly edited. To start with when carter jumps through 2 windows and it looks like he teleports. Once he's inside, the yakuza bath action is actually pretty solid and exciting. Again later he just teleports to push Ha-na inside a van. Other than those few blips where it looks like he teleports, theres also the trash camera work, wobbly, shaky and doesnt focus on anything long enough for it to be examined. Also, nevermind currently watching and just reached a scene where somebody LITERALLY JUST FLIES out of a river. I mean come oon you were doing fine before, stop brealing the laws of physics ffs."
카터,Carter,2022,2,,I've played some of the craziest VR titles and had dogfights in space.. been on rollercoaster rides while the body obviously is sitting still...  This movie tho...  Made me so sick watching it.....  The camera work/editing here.... wow!  Just wow.....  WOW!
카터,Carter,2022,1,,"Carter has an interesting premise, but that's pointless because the film is unwatchable. The camera work and editing are terrible. Every scene is unnecessarily jittery and strains your eyes as you attempt to keep track of the action. The jump cuts only make the experience that much worse. It was so disorienting I had to stop watching after 25 minutes. I'm not prone to motion sickness, but I felt queasy.  Do your eyes a favor and stay away from this ocular hazard. Instead, I recommend watching 1917 (2019) for some excellent camera work. And #Alive (2020) for a better viral infection/zombie movie."
카터,Carter,2022,4,,"This is just one of those things that if you're going to break something, do it in absurdly hilarious fashion.  1. No it's not for everyone.  2. The plot line is convoluted and non-sensical but that's ok because... 3. You'll be distracted by the incessant action.  4 Great locations and setpieces.  5. Creative shots and decent cinematography.  6. Too bad some of the.acting is wooden.  7. If you've got time to use up and brain cells to kill, this will be decent enough to pass the time. You'll either finish the movie or turn it off and do something else."
카터,Carter,2022,1,,"I really wanted to watch this movie, just couldn't last more than 10 minutes at a time with all the shaky camara work.  Ended up with a big headache after a couple attempts to watch. Would have been much more watchable if the film maker kept the camara steady.  Do not watch if you are prone to motion sickness."
카터,Carter,2022,6,,"On the whole, I suppose I enjoyed the film. I love Korean action movies, as they aren't afraid to push the bar when it comes to blood, gore, and sequences we've never seen before. At 2 hours 10 minutes, this is no quick watch, however. I won't rehash the synopsis as many reviews do, but make a couple of comments on the film in its entirety.  First and absolutely foremost is the direction and photography. The film was shot similarly to Hardcore Henry, but what I call one step removed. HH was shot first person POV. ""Carter"" (the film) is filmed like 1/2 step ahead of Carter the character; sometimes it looks like the POV is Carter's, other times the view is gyroscoping around him, while other times still the view is moving in sync with him but as if 3 feet in front of him. I didn't mind the multi-angular approach, but it made the entire film one big dizzying mess of discombobulatory explosions. Considering that I personally despise ""reality films,"" first person films, or found footage pieces, I nearly gave up on Carter. With the sheer volume of action the film attempts to capture, this type of photography is a challenge to experience in a short film, let alone one one the length of Carter. It didn't help the POV (wherever it was) was shaky. Seriously...whoever edited this film should be given both an Academy Award and a massive kick upside the head & threatened w/ death if ever done again. I absolutely understand that part of this is the age old trick of covering up some faults and not being able to critically view some of the stunts and gore. If the film hadn't been shot like this, it EASILY would be rated at a 7 or 8 in my book.             Overall, if you can stomach a shaky multi-angled first-and-a-half person film, then you will have overcome one of the largest shortcomings.  Definitely has a lot of graphic violence as well as a bit of brief nudity. Language is mostly tame."
카터,Carter,2022,6,,While agreeing on somewhat extreme superficial nature of certain action sequences Carter's cinematographic techniques induce the essential restlessness of Lee's journey to picture. What's problematic is the POV technique taking away the descriptive essence of combat scenes which in a way is also leaves the spectator wanting another round of watching. Plot is stuffed with so much detail that it could have been sorted in a better order. Skillful work by the cast in piecing together an excellent acting job. Great visuals and choice of surroundings with unique background audio. Carter is mission impossible thrown in to a zombie apocalypse which undoubtedly a great treat for movie fans.
카터,Carter,2022,2,,"Almost everything about this movie felt cheap, poorly executed and artificially acted. Some scenes are even comically poorly acted and the CG really does feel like it came back from the 90s."
카터,Carter,2022,8,,"The Camera Movement was a Bit of a Letdown. Carter would have easily be one of the best action movie in 2022, it's still a fun action movie to watch, The consent were outstanding, even tho we have seen a one Man Mission movie a million time, This was a whole new level of action movie."
카터,Carter,2022,6,,"There's an effort to make something fresh, with the camera.  The story is boring to death.  Back to the camera, it's a total mess.  Imposibles views or movement drives you like an insane roller coaster.  Ending to think: what happened?  Some actions are really too long just in order to make something impresive.  And 3 hours it's a lot..."
카터,Carter,2022,5,,"It plays lie the cut scenes between gameplay of an action video game. A third/first person shooter. With about the same level of plot. While watching I was wait for an up arrow, down arrow X Y down arrow. B. Still it was action packed.."
카터,Carter,2022,3,,"Carter's wife got shot while driving the jeep, I saw blood on the cloths and she is struggling to drive car with bullet wound. Next scene, she is fine, no blood in the cloths, she is back magically without bullet wound. No matter where Carter goes, middle of no where from parachute, endless city streets, there is always men in the corner waiting. How? Is entire country is against him? Another magic is lady on the phone seems to know all the building, random shop inside out. How?  Too much, did I say way Toooo muuuccchh Drone shot. Awesome fight scenes are ruined the experience by the drone. I can't seem to attach emotionally to any character, because of every scene is fight sequence. They want to use bikes, cars, jeeps, helicopters, train...seems they wanted to use everything is possilble. With the focus on drone and fights, they forgot the story. Some random characters talked about some randome dis on South korea and USA is not a story.  Carter is lost memory because of the device on his back of the head. Lost logic is memory is not stored there.  This is for mindless watching for teenagers."
카터,Carter,2022,5,,When i started see this movie first time i slept actually. So the next day i decided to watch it again. But i slept again. I tried After two days but i feet sleepy most of the time. I suggested to some of my friends. And they also felt the same way. Because we watched more enough like this type of action. This film made to look a like one shot film. That is also makes things soooo booooring. So the efforts of the team is very good. But the film got wasted by the production design.
카터,Carter,2022,2,,"How to make an action movie with no impact. Ingest some bad acting, plot incoherence a dash of 2000's special effect, a table spoon of « oooh music » Let it cook with a yo-yoing camera from left to right, up and down and back and forth.  Wait two hours, puke it and there you go, you've got a Carter.  Why a 2 and not a 1? Well because I'm sure there was some talented people involve in the movie, I just haven't found them."
카터,Carter,2022,6,,Basically Korean version of Crank you'll find whether it's thrilling or dizzying. Applaud Jung Byung-gil's effort to made it look like one long shot with violent action sequences and dramatic revelations. Joo Won strongly played unhinged character from the start.
카터,Carter,2022,2,,"The plot in itself, is not the worst.  Could have been a good movie, if all involved was switched out with someone who knew what they were doing.  The start until end, makes me feel like im on a constant rollercoaster, after multiple shots of extremely sweetened high proof alcohol.  The monotone dialogues makes me want to just do a voiceover myself, along with the group of friends watching it.  Actors seem to have been pulled from the street, going by who was the dullest and most stereotypical for type of role.  All in all, save yourself from spending over 2 hours of what actually gave me nothing but dizzyness."
카터,Carter,2022,4,,It's over kill. The story is fine & its actually a lot like the movies I like to watch but the fighting is too long and ridiculously fake even this type of movie.
카터,Carter,2022,8,,All the movie wants is to be fun and it is. Why people taking this so serious? Yes is over the top. Yes is like Jason Borne in steroids  Don't understand the low rating.
카터,Carter,2022,6,,"The story is not good and unfollowable. The actors don't overplay anything as there isn't much acting... the visuals hurt the eyes in terms of CGI, but the fights and gore are very good! Im Not really understand what are these (zombie) things doin in the movie, but sometimes its just help on the story. However, the locations are very good."
카터,Carter,2022,2,,"This is not a movie! It's a waste of all Human time and resources spent on production of this joke and waste of antibody's life who watch it even for a minute. One of the worse ""thing"" (it's not a movie"" that was ever made.  Bad beyond bad. Almost as bad as whatever with Sarah Jessica Parker in it! Yes, that bad!"
카터,Carter,2022,5,,This is like watching a friend play an action bloody Video Game that has all the weapons he needs and a coach telling him what to Due.  Unfortunately I dont play games and love my action Movies.
카터,Carter,2022,2,,I gave this movie a shot cause the action was good but I can't watch it longer than 15mins I had to stop because I felt dizzy the shots was so shaky most of the time it felt like the movie was an earthquake with a magnitude that will knock you out in just 20seconds lol  Don't get me wrong I did rest in my first watch then sleep because of dizziness then I continued watching it but I really can't last longer than 15mins its not fair with the movie and the actor he was good such a shame.
카터,Carter,2022,1,,"Action is one thing but if it is constant and never-ending it's boring. The EfX were great but the acting was pitiful. The writers must have had zero skills in screenplay and opted for continuous, outlandish car chases, crashes, fight scenes, gory splatter."
카터,Carter,2022,6,,"You got the gore of John Wick and you got the mind of Jason Bourne shaking hands with Jackie Chan and Tom Clancy. The action, combat, and suspense carries the story well although the acting narrative makes for poor transition in between. Nevertheless, the film is full of action sequences making it quite outstanding."
카터,Carter,2022,1,,I can enjoy an over the top action flick but this was completely ridiculous. Total waste of time. I wanted to stop watching several times but struggled thru hoping for some form of redemption that never came. So bad I had to create an account just to leave my first ever review saying how bad it is!!!!!
카터,Carter,2022,1,,"Very hectic camera work, bad camera cuts, unrealistic scenes with a unnecessary film story.  So bad, that i had to laugh many times while watching...  Waste of time, please dont watch."
카터,Carter,2022,8,,"Well if you cant stand the sight of blood, then forget carter. Have got used to violence and gore in my grumpy old age, and i can enjoy viewing the cataclysmic bestiallic way of killing and dismantelment of the human configuration as long as it is superbly filmed, acted and effectuated, and sequence in the mosh pit of mineral enriched bathingwater and steamin hot sauna environment as in this film leaves me just freaking lost for words.  The plot starts mad, and it gets mader until madoff took the money and ran of to dmz to become a sozialist. Action impossible at moments, the speed is so high as a rave party on atmospheric ecstasy(by nebulisator), that the fall after this one will be like getting kaliumisosorbat in your veins.  So if you like blood and gore welcome to south korean netflix haven, if you do not you wont regret your choice.cause warningshots blasted of in you tuba auditiva may make the whining angels sing, just like my tinitus. A shocker flick it is, and very recommendable."
카터,Carter,2022,1,,Please please take this crap off Netflix and destroy all copies.  Nobody should endure the pain of watching this garbage.  Ranks as one of the worst movies ever made.  Total and utter rubbish.
카터,Carter,2022,3,,"Will is good idea to have great one shot scene but not the whole movie, give you headache which you can't really focus on point of action you want to see. Good 15 min of it and you get sick 🤢 of it."
카터,Carter,2022,2,,"The worst movie i ever watched, lost continuity full of headache not because of thinking about the story, but the animation is not blending with the project  Overuse, to much dramatised  I can even tell how bad this movie was, only 30 minutes since the movie start and i already had a headache 👏🏻"
카터,Carter,2022,1,,"If you ever want to watch this movie - the first thing you should do is switch off your brain before watching it. Or cut of your head and then watch it. That way it will be enjoyable. The visuals are stunning - IF you can keep yourself from hurling. No, not for gruesomeness, but for the constant spinning effect of the camera. South Koreans.. they have outdone themselves this time."
카터,Carter,2022,1,,"The movie looks good. Good directing, good photography, but the acting and the cgi (which they use a lot of) are so bad that it's kinda of impossible to ignore.  They used CGI even for things like smoke coming from a cigarette and birds flying, it looks awful and takes you away from the movie.  The acting is atrocious."
카터,Carter,2022,2,,"The film certainly had potential but I couldn't watch more than 20mins without feeling nauseous.  It's as if a child had filmed everything on their iPhone and just stitched random frames together, not to mention half off the clips looked as if they were from a computer game.  Well if anyone ever wants to experience what it feels like to take ecstasy and mushrooms at the same time without actually taking it, then watch this film.  I would like the film to have a re-release without all the dumb upside down and shaky camera angles. Argh!"
카터,Carter,2022,1,,"I thought I was almost done, turns out I still had an hour and a half left. I just can't. The action scenes seem to be the only reason this movie exists and they are so contrived they make the Fast and Furious movies looks feasible. One sequence required 3 vans to be moving at the exact same rate of speed and distance for longer than I could believe possible in any situation. And physics? What are those? We need you to have the power to fly now or this scene won't work. We're also going to need these vehicles to drive themselves for a little while just so the main character can jump from one to the other as his dispatches the drivers.  I can't do it.  I just can't do it anymore."
카터,Carter,2022,2,,Korean story with mythical story line.. Actions are of next level but imagination is mythical only😂😂🤣 I give it one extra star just for its action.. Otherwise it deserve minus 10 star.  Complete fake imagination which you won't ever believe or imagine in your 1000000000000000000000...... years life.  Mr. Director and writer you should write mythological books instead of movies story.  I can't believe your baseless brain can think about it to work on.
카터,Carter,2022,5,,"The background story is great, the start is quite awesome. What ruining it, is first the CGI, the effect that not perfect at all, the color and etc. Second is the script, is like childish and awkward. The ending just meh :/"
카터,Carter,2022,1,,This is going to be short and sweet.  The only saving grace for this film is some clever camera work.  The rest however is an awful mix of over the top ridiculous action scenes and awful effects.  Awful awful film.
카터,Carter,2022,4,,"The CGI reminds me of, who killed captain alex. And why did try to make it one shot using that poor shaky camera effect between cuts.the idea behind it isnt bad. It just needed a different crew."
카터,Carter,2022,1,,"It's so bad that you may even start enjoying it.  Everything is in abundance here. Most over the top, unbelievable action set-pieces ever. I'm sure this movie holds the record for most gunshots fired in a movie (also for the most number of people killed by gunshots in a movie). Gunshots were fired - in buildings, on the scaffold supporting the building, in the streets, on the motorbike, in the car, in the van, in the pickup truck, in the army truck, in the train, on the train, inside the helicopter, outside the helicopter hanging with a wire, in the plane, in the air free-falling from the plane, on the hanging bridge, hanging from the hanging bridge.  Eagerly waiting for Carter-2 (for gunshots in water, boats, ships, submarines) and Carter-3 (for gunshots in space, space shuttle, space station)."
카터,Carter,2022,10,,"You will get a constant motion sickness. Its like it was shot using a handheld camera with no image stabilization, drone used is like from a drone bought from Wish. Cant even focus on 1 thing for more than 5seconds. Editing and cutting is terrible, you can see the cut and stitch of the video. Great actors but terrible story. Terrible shot all throughout the film."
카터,Carter,2022,3,,"Like most people have mentioned in their reviews, this movie is very similar to watching the cutscenes in a first person shooter game.  It is a wild ride if you are into that genre with some funky shots and kill scenes. It lacks the finesse of John Wick though.  But the camera work while it is pretty funky especially in the opening scene, gets old real quick after that. And seriously i needed to stop the movie several times while I contemplated emptying my dinner into a bucket.  The story is not for anyone who likes logic or sense so keep that in mind. Like this mysterious disease that they are trying to cure. Are they turning in to zombies?  I wouldn't say don't watch this. As it can be fun for some people. But definitely bear in mind the nauseating camera work and the lack of any real character development or story even for its over 2 hour run time. Which I guess are this movie's biggest weakness.  The Korean actors do a good job with the acting. Their Caucasian counterparts though probably only got the roles because they aren't Korean and not due to any acting abilities. As the acting was terrible."
카터,Carter,2022,3,,"The movie got carried away with blood and gore, from ""this gonna be good"" to ""yeah, whatever you say ..."", 30 minutes in, you still don't know what the plot is, the westerners looking actors can't act, and you don't connect with any of the characters. Really bad movie, couldn't finish it."
카터,Carter,2022,1,,"The action scene are great, the history is nothing special, BUT the biggest problem of this film is how this film was shoot and the composition. It's Just Terrible. You can't watch with detail, because of the camera shake and the transitions to make a fake one shot film. The effects are not that great either. Its just terrible, start to finish. If wasn't for that, the movie could be enjoyable."
카터,Carter,2022,9,,On a whole its fun to watch with non stop action. Camera work is cool. Some action scenes are way over but ok. Would have been nice too see the whole movie in english.
카터,Carter,2022,3,,"I have given up on movies half way through; this time I got three quarters through before dumping it. Why? This movie has lots of eye candy with stunts and CGI. What it doesn't have is coherrence of story. There's a new virus that started in the Korean DMZ. Some blame North Korea, some South Korea, some the USA. I don't know if that ever gets resolved or not; when I finally quit this hot mess, I didn't care.  It was confusing about daughters. Was Carter's daughter in danger, was the top researcher's daughter in danger, or both? The plot(?) was as clear as mud on a dark night. Acting? Who knows. In the 2 hours and 12 minutes of gob-smacking action, there wasn't time to act. In the end, a movie has to make the audience love or hate the characters. Carter did neither. Please, writers and director, clarify the story and try again. Fantastic stunts and high body count does not a movie make."
카터,Carter,2022,3,,Camera work is an utter mess.  Plot shambles. Everything else shambles. Nothing made sense. Its so bad you begin to enjoy it after a time. Honestly horrific.
카터,Carter,2022,1,,I haven't really had the time till now to specifically write about any movie but this movie has made me do so. An epic failure comprising of wasted budget with pathetic graphics and even worst storyline that was simply cringeful and the worst experience that could be catered for a viewer.
카터,Carter,2022,1,,It's literally 2 hours of spinning shaky cam. Acting is horrific. Story is nonsense. CGI is terrible. The action scenes are unwatchable unless you have a vomit bag. If you are the type that likes really bad movies you might get a laugh out of it.
카터,Carter,2022,4,,"I get is it's great one shot with adrenaline rush action scenes. I can see great effort have been put to create this film. I would absolutely love this film if I were studying filmography or was filmography enthusiast. But I'm neither of those, I am just a viewer and I'd like my film to be fun to watch. Sadly this film has thrown logic and fun out of the box. I rate this fim 4/10 for effort, otherwise this is trash film."
카터,Carter,2022,10,,"Loved it , a must watch, the lead man is amazing . He is very good actor, little word but lots of action... but still managed to tell a story that has a lot of reality of issues we are suffering now."
카터,Carter,2022,5,,"Here's a clear example of all style, no substance.  Normally i would start a review a brief headline of the plot, but this movies story is so convoluted and to be frank, just plain boring, so i'll get into the action, which is what most of us watch an action movie for and to be fair, this movie does have plenty of action, in fact almost all the way through. There's also some really good, inventive fight scenes, to which i have to give hats off to everyone involved, along with some great looking stunts, albeit ones that are so out unrealistic, they make Fast and Furious look like a documentary.  Sadly there's just too much wrong with this to be enjoyable. Not only that terrible storyline, but also it's far too long, i found myself clock-watching, which in an movie with so much action tells us a lot. There's also way too much unnecessary blood splatter. This isn't a horror guys, tone it down a bit. Take a leaf from Matrix, John Wick or even Kill Bill, which all have less blood than this and are all great films.  However, these are not the movies biggest problems. These are 1... The over-used sweeping camera style, which i applaud their originality, but it gets old real quick, better to use it sparingly to make certain scenes stand out. Couple that with the camera's absolutely terrible shakiness and you you would be not alone to have a headache by the end.  And 2. The unforgivably bad cgi, particularly with the explosions and green screen elements to which i could have done better myself with free software.  Put all this together and you have a movie that is more like a video game cut scene, running for over 2 hours and as a gamer, i can tell you that i would not play that game.  And another thing, if the lead had lost his memory, how did he remember to fight, shoot , use gadgets and stay alive against literally hundreds of men?  It's a shame really, because this could have been a great movie and i do wonder, had it have had a bigger budget, would it have been? Oh well, i guess i'll forget this movie by tomorrow anyway."
카터,Carter,2022,1,,"By far The Worst action movie I have ever seen. Unnecessary and overdone actions and violence, poor filming and special effects Combined with a ridiculous story about CIA, north and South Korea.complete waste of time."
카터,Carter,2022,3,,"Very weak 'The Raid: Redemption' clone, like so many others.  Three stars for very good start.  As with 'The Raid' or any clone of it - I do not expect great story line, I do not expect drama, I do not expect over the top acting; Here everything falls apart very quick. CGI becomes too unreal like Bolywood. Meaningless storyline becomes brain fog preventing me to enjoy movie, by the half of it I do not know what is going on - I start hating all sides for being unrelatable. Most importantly I am impatient and I want to turn it off. Mess.  I believe it is missing logic flow, it has super imposed forced CGI, too many unrelatable characters and forced drama, over the top stupid storyline.  To wash my brain I am going to watch now Judge Dredd 2012 which reminds me of The Raid."
카터,Carter,2022,3,,"This story and especially the way it's shot is more like a video game than a movie. It's at least a half hour too long. It's very much like watching someone else play a first person game. The story lost me about 30 minutes in, I had no idea who was working with who or why. The action scenes are pretty good if you can overlook how outside reality they are. I can't recommend this one at all."
카터,Carter,2022,1,,The camera angles are such that it is difficult to keep up with what is going on. It just keeps on turning and turning and turning and turning and turning and turning and turning and turning and turning and turning..... and so on. You get my point. I cannot begin to imagine what hell the director must have put editors in to edit this movie. I literally cannot stand up after seeing this film as the world around me seems to be turning too. I would highly suggest that you avoid this film unless you want 2+ hours of turning camera angles that might even rotate your eyeballs at the back of your head.
카터,Carter,2022,1,,"The enitre film is a motion sickness inducing pile of garbage... The story is nonsensical, the camera work made this movie impossible for me to watch was left with a headache after 15 min."
카터,Carter,2022,10,,"We are all amazed by this jaw dropping action movie. The action and camera lineup were never seen before. This film contains 10 times of 007 actions. If this is possible in Korean filmography, we are sure that next year we'll see something beyond imagination by Korean film industry. 10/10 by any standard. Storyline was compromised for the actions but more than enough for action film. The actions are mind blowing. We watch so many action packed movies but this film delivers the best adrenaline packed solutions we ever imagined. We were able to see some CG images but mostly it was raw enough from the beginning till the end. Ignore any negative feedbacks as it does deliver the real hard core actions from the begining till the end. It's one of top ten films in the UK and this film deserves that."
카터,Carter,2022,1,,Weak storyline that had too much of a mish mash of ideas. Big fail in the camera work. Too much of distraction and not enough effort put in with the cheesy gore. Netflix is done. It's all downhill from here.
카터,Carter,2022,4,,"The movie's story is about a deadly epidemic. A scientist, who discovers a cure for this epidemic with his daughter being the source, gets kidnapped by an unknown party. Both North and South Korea become involved. Amidst all this, a young man with amnesia awakens from a coma and must protect the scientist's daughter, and the troubles begin.  An exciting story, isn't it? It would have been if it weren't for the poor direction, bad cinematography, and subpar chase scenes.  The storyline is excessively repetitive, and The cinematography induces nausea due to the poor direction and terribly bad acting. The major disaster that made me sick was the way action scenes and chases were filmed.  Note: I couldn't finish the movie till the end.  Another note for clarification: The reason I rated the movie 4/10 is solely because of the knife fight scene at the beginning of the film. Without that scene, I would rate the movie 1/10.  And thus, it is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life so far."
카터,Carter,2022,4,,Carter (2022).  4/10.  So boring that I slept off and I made no effort to fight the sleep.  Except for the fight scenes which by the way looks like a video game but with shaky cameras.  🤝🤝🤝
카터,Carter,2022,2,,Was having high hoped for it but end up getting disappointed. Could have been a decent movie if it's not for the nauseating camera works. The director was probably so obsessed playing with FPS games as a child and tried bringing that experience to the movie. But the constantly shaky and spinning around shots made it look amateurish and completely destroyed what could have been a decent movie. Don't waste your time watching it.
카터,Carter,2022,3,,"...but really bad for a movie.  Sure, its action-packed insanity. But still not interesting, and not even really exiting. Everything moves so fast - the actor, machines, people - that the viewer doesnt create a connection to the actors or anything else. And so, you just dont care about it at all.  Example for a movie that is similar, but much better in so many ways: THE RAID.  Go play a videogame instead."
카터,Carter,2022,8,,"Impressive camera work. In entire movie I was just wondering, how they shooted such one those scenes. Movie is OK. Action is good. One minute silence for those who are criticising about camera work. Still must watch for action lovers ."
카터,Carter,2022,1,,This movie is out of the box bad. It's a wannabe John Wick action combined with Mission Impossible with camera shooting style of Blair Witch Project. Confusing story line and just piss poor camera work that makes you dizzy to a point where you might lose your lunch or dinner.
카터,Carter,2022,3,,"There so many details of this movie that were almost good/cool then it's just utterly ruined by overdoing it. I do not disagree with all the critics calling this movie 'tiring' whatsoever, it's not how I'd sum it up though.  Most seem to be most bother by the non-stop action which just became.. non-stop. The almost believable fighting, until the guy fights like 100 dudes at once and doesn't seem to ever get tired.. I felt John Wick vibes then it's as if they felt John Wick was too believable/watered down from their favorite Jacky Chan film so they mixed and matched.. If they took the action down from 95% of the film to like 75% ish they'd have had a much better film. Although the plot and writing wasn't a strong point either, so the rest would need be filled with more non-believable gibberish. Your choice, less over-the-top action scenes and more crappy dialogue that you can pick apart?  The swinging camera cut-scenes that transition into some of the worst sped up graphic effects cuts I have ever seen. It was almost a cool cinematographic effect if they eased it down but it went from being cool to being completely cringey. It seems like a lot of drone camera work which I thought was cool but then there is all these unnecessary speed ups (probably to mask the awful effects). It's like using a filming technique to make it look more real then instantly making it look more fake then ever. That scene with the helicopter was particularly amateur looking, but then again so was the entire two scenes that came before it.. I feel like some real budget movies have graphics just as good as this movie in todays age, maybe better..  It's like there were two competing minds creating this movie - one who had all these great ideas, then someone who came in afterwards and took every one of those ideas and completely ruined them. It doesn't even seem benevolent, it is so bad that it is as if someone didn't like the idea of the movie and wanted to actively ruin it."
카터,Carter,2022,3,,I had long tiime seen so exagerated fighting scenes. Especially the one when they throw of the plane with parachute was epic. He is better than agent 007. I think you can see the movie if just for fun because verything is really unreal.
카터,Carter,2022,5,,"There really is too much mayhem and too little plot development. The end has waaaay too much swinging from helicopters. The bad guy was a poorly acted cliche. That being said, the effects were decent if overused. I couldn't help wondering if the guy wasn't tired, there was so much mayhem!."
카터,Carter,2022,4,,"Hard to review this one. While the one-take premise was impressive and wow absolutely non-stop action sequences, the actual action itself was both nauseating and kind of stupid. Many scenes defying gravity and the eternally moving camera work even on non-action scenes grew tedious. It's Korean Harcore Henry. It was OK but someone needs to perfect this one single take premise because neither of the 2 movies really pull it off. For some reason a lot of the movie felt like watching a video game with some really stuttery camera movements. Also all the English speaking scenes had horrendous acting.  Although most of the action was pretty good, some of the worst action scenes include the falling through the sky scene, the motorbike chase scene and the helicopter scene. Awful."
카터,Carter,2022,5,,"Honestly it felt like viewing a arcade action shooting game rather then a movie. Good things ware the unique style of camera work & the fighting. The whole movie is basically a compilation of non stop action sequence.  It is an utterly ridiculous movie but kinda guilty viewing pleasure. Who needs story, script, acting, plot, common sense, logic or even physics. Just shove loads and loads of non stop Action down to the throat till you vomit the shove some more and keep repeating this process until the last frame of the movie."
카터,Carter,2022,10,,"I really don't understand why this movie still don't get the high ratings. From start till end every shot keeps insisting me watching this movie without blink of an eye. This movie has all the stuff you want. Strong story, screenplay, drama, hard core non stop action, wild camera angles. I suggest that please ignore the bad reviews and give this movie just twenty minutes and I bet you forget everything after that."
카터,Carter,2022,5,,"Someone decided to turn a 1st person shooter video game into a movie! The storyline is Zombie Appocolipse End of Days! So much potential, so missing personal feelings and emotions! Time to turn off the video game and go outside!"
카터,Carter,2022,1,,What is with the silted and terrible dialogue and acting?  How about hiring some real actors not random foreigners who answered a stupid expat in korea facebook advertisement.
카터,Carter,2022,4,,The story was good it had its twists and turns. The actor did a decent job with his acting. Unfortunately the poor cinematography and editing ruined it for me. Unnecessary cuts and fast paced scenes... they litteraly gave me a headache and the background music could've done better.
카터,Carter,2022,3,,Action scene looks like video game. A lot of shaking handling & naked scene which was not necessary. Very dissappointed watched for first 30 minutes..
카터,Carter,2022,4,,"Imagine all your favorite foods - a steak, lobster, crab legs, shrimp, mashed potatoes, corn on the cob, etc. Now, imagine them all cooked together into a mushy mess where they were indistinguishable from each other. That is this movie.  It seems like someone saw Hardcore Henry and thought, well, I liked that, but I also liked all of the Tom Cruise Mission Impossible movies, and Escape From New York, and Mad Max: Fury Road, and Train to Busan, and a whole bunch of other movies, many of them maybe by Michael Bay. They then decided to throw them all into one movie with the resulting mushy mess.  Also imagine that they blew a large part of their budget on getting one (yes one) B+ US actor and paying for various set locations while skimping on CGI, choreography, script, story, cinematography, and other things that go into making a movie. Don't get me wrong though, not all of these things were complete flaming piles of dog poo - some things actually weren't bad, but when you see those things you won't remember them.  What you will remember are the blurry action sequences that made no sense, the dialogue that seemed to be perfectly fine English from one actor and butchered English from another - as if it were written by two (five) different people, a disjointed story that just kept going when it was obvious it should have stopped a long time ago, and a bunch of other issues that just made it feel like if it weren't for the insane action you would probably have just stopped watching already.  Really, the insanity of it all was the only reason to watch it. Every action piece in this movie harkens back to an older movie you may have seen based on your age - seriously, not one thing in this was original in any way and yes, some of the references were a bit old, so for you younger people I get that you may not believe it. Still, with all of that said four stars isn't TOO bad."
카터,Carter,2022,10,,"Maybe not everyone cup of tea. Many people says this movie like a video game, oh well who cares because thus movie is good 👍🏼 Joo Won nailed it, he handle the action so well and I think no stuntman involved."
카터,Carter,2022,5,,I always enjoy a film with good action scenes. And I enjoyd the zombie type plot. The no cut technique was cool but I felt there was just no let up from the constant action. Its not a bad thing but I would have liked more character development and I just didn't get it here. Still a cool and unique film though with some good acting.
카터,Carter,2022,3,,"I usually like Korean action movies because the action is high octane and well done. This film was over-the-top absurd. Think Keanu Reeves in ""John Wick"", John Bernthal in ""Punisher"", Jason Statham in ""Wild Card"", Josh Brolin in ""Old Boy"", and ""Daredevil"" on steroids.  The Hero is is more indestructible than Superman and Iron Man.  The dialog in places was embarrassingly bad. The movie seemed interminably long and should have been edited down by at least thirty minutes. If you're 13-23 years old, you may find it passable."
카터,Carter,2022,5,,"I'm a little bit more than half way done right now, but I'm not sure if I'll be able to finish it. The shakiness/ lack of stability of the cameras is making me nauseous and is giving me a headache/ making my eyes hurt.  I've never complained about non-stop action in a movie but they went overboard with this one. It's completely unnecessary to do birds eye view 720s around a vehicle that is driving in a straight line all while shaking the camera.  Reminds me of Hardcore Henry but even that didn't make me want to throw up. Even when the action has paused and there is a brief moment of calm, the camera movement is still shaky and nausea inducing.  Will try to finish the movie without throwing up."
카터,Carter,2022,2,,"This is an action flick. It does not aspire to be anything other than an action flick. But it is also a long action flick - in spite of the non-stop action, those 2 hours and 12 minutes really feel like three hours.  If you like action and only action, you might like this. If you like other things in your action movies (such as a coherent storyline, character development, plausible plot devices, passable acting, good camera work, impressive special effects, careful editing etc) then maybe not. And if you're at all troubled by flashing, bouncy motion with lots of abrupt cuts then definitely skip this one."
카터,Carter,2022,5,,"I guess we all have to suspend our disbelief to watch action movies but this one pushes the concept really very far. With Carter we're almost in the realm of superhero kind of action, but the Telugu-inspired stunts and their improbable physics are too cartoonish for a movie that isn't.  When you go so dramatically over-the-top you better make sure the execution and direction are impeccable, or that you introduce some sort of cinematographic or choreographic innovation, like Ong Bak or Jason Bourne, but that's not the case here.  To be fair there are here and there some pretty cool moves and you can't accuse the movie makers of lacking imagination, but the action scenes are way too long and dizzying, becoming endless sequences of superhuman acrobatics on poor CGI and average camera work."
카터,Carter,2022,8,,"There is a plot, a simple one but there is a story to tell. Action from the beginning to the end.  People who rate movies 1 or 2 have Attention deficit disorder."
카터,Carter,2022,5,,"I'm usually a big fan of korean movies, but this one was very disappointing. I thought only the Americans made ridiculous and unrealistic action type movies, where a single person murders entire armies (ex. John Wick, Die hard and so forth), but these guys took it even further beyond that. I include in the negatives the propaganda against North Korea and this ''alternative'' direction that made my head spin throughput the movie."
카터,Carter,2022,5,,"This movie has a lot going for it but not the best of South Korean action movies. The story is convoluted. The attempt to work a Pandemic into the story is cheap, rather than timely. The action cinematography is exciting but not my favorite style. It is violent and fast paced. I like the stars. There are some very cool visual, fight scenes in this one. If this was my first exposure to South Korean films I would be intrigued, but as a fan of the genre I know there are much higher quality ones out there."
카터,Carter,2022,5,,"While movie has a nice story, has a full pack of action scenes , however most combat scenes are unrealistic, blood splatter scenes which are also more close to a comic than an action movie, shaky camera movement which makes you dizzy.  Nice in concept, bad in execution. Watched it normally for 30 minutes or so and then fast forwarded it to check if something of the above changed during story play. It did not."
카터,Carter,2022,5,,"Too much camera work makes it unbearable to watch. Was interesting at first, but after 30 minutes of watching, I promise you'll get a headache...  Storywise, it is decent, but as it becomes longer and longer, it becomes painful to watch because of too much camera shake.  Had decent action and fight scenes, but the effects are very noticeable, to which some areas may look like a low-budget film.  Like everyone else is saying, it had great potential but greatly ruined by the camea angle and shots. It's like there is too much happening because of the non-stop action and continuous camera shots..  I give it a 5/10."
카터,Carter,2022,5,,"This film wants to follow the trend of ""1917"" and ""Birdman"" making appear thre narration as a continuous one, but the edition is not so pristine to achieve that.  There are several noticeable goofs revealing separate scenes clumsily united betraying faulty skills in the technicians doing this.  The story is excessive and exaggerated. It also reminded me of. Park Chan-wook's ""Oldboy"" when a single man fights an army of opponents.  As a gory spectacle, it works for the masses, but i guess films can offer a lot more than that."
카터,Carter,2022,10,,"I can't find the language to say. It seems like the entire movie was shot in one short Carter and The Villainess , two movies. The direction and the camera work and screen play and action were all Josh. Thank you Jeong Byeong-Gil for giving everyone such a beautiful movie. I will watch all your movies.  ,This movie is a Full of action packed , A lot of breathtaking scenes , The camera angle is so great . Kudos to the director of this movie. I enjoyed watching it . There's no dull moments , I think this is the best korean action movies that I'd watched so far ! Joo won . One of the best korean actor."
카터,Carter,2022,1,,Its long even when watching at 2x Headache inducing movie Low cgi Bad acting Worse script God what in earth was the director sniffing.  Its long even when watching at 2x.
카터,Carter,2022,5,,"I love korean actors-and movies-usually superb this was ok but not one to watch again-the cgi was bad-awful usually they do real stunts but maybe to much risk for netflix-then it leaves a bad taste at ending,i for one like the actors-no idea y mike colter/or camilla belle-were even in it,also most of the cia guys looked like they just came from doing the matrix as mr smiths cronies.-watch but then forget."
카터,Carter,2022,3,,"Ok, have to admit they tried to do something and put quite a lot of efford in it but... the execution is quite bad. It feels like gameplay and game cutscenes in the majority of times, but .. not very well made.  The movie tries to be something like Hardcore Henry, very action packed movie , with crazy stunts and seemingly long takes with almost no cuts.  Well, the first and most noticable thing is the crazy ""chaotic"" camera work, which doesnt work well in most of the times. The blending with the CGI is very noticable and bad for 2022 movie, and as the movie progress the camera work start to become more and more choppy and stuttering. No idea why, probably rushed by the end of it.  Few cool sequences tho, have to admit that, but they are not original, just stolen ideas from other movies, and made.. cheaper.  Acting is mediocre. Not the worst you'd see.  The movie being 2:20h is another big negative when the execution lacks so much. It feels tiresome. Some scenes are way too long, like the skydiving one. And the movie has the same problem as cheap 80s action movies - infinite bullets with no reloading lol. Muzzle flash and blood CGI are not well .  Bein that long, with the whole execution problem is the reason i wouldnt recommend it. Kinda waste of time  Script starts kinda fine complex and intense at times, but gets mudded near the end.  The movie overa."
카터,Carter,2022,5,,Interesting exercise in film making that contributes nothing to the storytelling; no character development to speak of. This ends up feeling like watching someone play a video game; ultimately empty & pointless. A sad waste of a lot of technical VFX film making technique.
카터,Carter,2022,4,,"This movie definitely has non-stop action and unrealistic situations (like a guy holding onto the side of a plane, unrealistic)  I don't know how you pull someone, that has lost their memory, into this intense of a mission. This dude just complies and knows how to operate everything! Way too much flashing and CGI-play."
카터,Carter,2022,3,,"This movie had a lot of potential with its cool action scenes, choreography and sometimes really good camera work. But this feels very disorienting to watch to a point it's actually unwatchable. My eyes got exhausted after about 30 minutes and i had to skim through the rest to somewhat understand where the plot was gonna go.  It's like 'Hardcore Henry' on meth, see that movie instead, and avoid this one if you are easily disoriented.  A shame really, cause the action was well done."
카터,Carter,2022,10,,All staffs trained special forces ? This movie action is totally insane . Especially director is crazy . One take camera moving and flying scroll and tracking was beautiful . Is it overlapping ? Anyway it is good movie though. 2hours like 20 min.
카터,Carter,2022,4,,"Great action movie, punches and kicks flying around during the whole movie the CGI is really bad though. What they did with the camera is nice for a while but not for the whole movie for you start getting a bit sick with all the movement and shakes of it. All in all a good movie to chill at home."
카터,Carter,2022,2,,"""No memory. One mission."": That mission clearly wasn't ""Find capable actors"" or ""film on professional camera's"". Positive: 10 minutes in and everybody on screen is naked or semi-naked. Negative: You have to watch 10 minutes of the movie to get there. As far as I can tell this is a cross between a zombie-movie, the scene where Neo tries to escape the agents in The Matrix, and Crank. Put together in the worst way imaginable. From weird angles, unnessecary prolonged shots of people starting at eachother to the very stunted and forced-feeling dialog; this is the worst version of the movie it could have been. The (admittedly nicely choreographed) fight scenes redeem the movie somewhat, but are themselves let down by atrocious audio design and frankly insane scoring. Avoid like an infected zombie."
카터,Carter,2022,5,,Movie Story - Not Good.  Action - Severe. (Great Action concept but performed in excessively).  Actors Acting - Not so good.  Camera sequence - Nice concept but should be kept in moderate.
카터,Carter,2022,4,,"Acting - overall pretty good. Action scenes were well acted and choreographed.  Camera work - horrific. Most of the movie is on a drone or a handheld camera. Because of that you get super shaky camera work and weird angles from the drone that is pure stupidity.  Editing - home made amateur. You can visually see the cuts in editing. Weather sometimes just instantaneously changes. Sometimes time of day is different. Among many other bad edits.  CGI - brutal. Feels like 16-bit video game CGI sometimes.  Script - overall story is decent. But some of the scenes written are overly stupid. For example being dragged by a vehicle in a gun/car chase where tons of agents are attempting to kill you. Instead of shooting the target, they ditch the bike and jump in the car wait for the target to get in and then try and shoot? Haha that was unbelievably silly.  Movie had so much potential though. Really too bad the negatives are so large."
카터,Carter,2022,4,,"As others have said, the camera work is both amazing, but absolutely horrible. It's a perfect example of just because you can do something, it doesn't mean you should. The action is non-stop, I don't recall another film where one guy has killed this many people, but it really wears you out trying to follow it due to the constant drone camera work."
카터,Carter,2022,9,,This movie put you right In The screen. Crazy first person view action with unbelievably shot one cut scenes kept me amazed. I wish the storyline was stronger but this shouldn't bother you from watching this film. Through out the movie you will be on top of your toes. Definitely recommended!
카터,Carter,2022,3,,"The movie is shot in a way to pretend that it's a one-shot film. For an action movie, it means that the camera is constantly flying around like on a drone from scene to scene. But that also means it doesn't give your brain any chance to pause and readjust to the new location.  I play a lot of first person shooter video games and this movie STILL gave me motion sickness from all the random camera movements. .If you are prone to get car sick or motion sickness, do NOT watch this movie. It would be torture for you.  As for the convoluted plot and the purposely ambiguous ending, seriously meh. You are left to question which side the main character was really on, kind of a ""Total Recall"" scenario. But it was really too forced."
카터,Carter,2022,5,,"Combine Jason Bourne, John Wick, any of the Matrix movies and any pending zombie apocalypse movie, cram all of them into a movie and you get this two hour plus mishmash of a movie. Like the first Bourne movie this movie begins with the character having no memory of who he is. Like John Wick there are extended running gun and martial arts scenes. The kill count probably exceeds all three Wick movies combined. Like the Matrix there is a lot of supernatural stunt work and the CIA agents just keep coming like the agents in the Matrix. Throw in zombies who can run, fight and use weapons just for good measure. The run time is at least thirty minutes too long. It got to the point where I just kept hoping it would end."
카터,Carter,2022,5,,"Carter starts pretty wild - and it never stops. Action scenes are so fast, that you barely see CGI trickery. But at times, the stunts are a bit over the top.  Maybe the screenwriters should have given ""Carter"" special abilities - because as even perfectly trained human being, he would have been dead - probably two dozen times.  Anyway - the action is ""cool"", what was turning me down was the confusion. Some interesting story paths, just went into nowhere - as if they never existed. It is also the blatant black and white painting, which is awful - and some awful stereotypes... e.g. You can say a lot about the CIA - but not, that they have super brutal action teams, which are acting in the day of light.  Is the confusion.purposely? Not sure - however it prevents the movie to be far better. And also: nobody really needs in the script kinda zombies, which never really get any adequate explanation nor screen time;. What you see of this zombie virus is interesting - but then the movie has no time for this.  And this is overall the problem. The film is so stuffed full of action, that the story, characterizations etc. Have to time and no space to breath.  Still worthwhile to spend some time on."
카터,Carter,2022,4,,"The movie is edited to appear as one continuous take, which I like, but they are really bad at joining the cuts- you can and will spot about every single one... on top of that, the concept of physics just takes a break every once in a while... and the CGI is ""noticeable"". Overall still kind of enjoyable to watch- the plot is ok and the non-CGI-action is pretty good."
카터,Carter,2022,4,,"It started off interesting, some nice set pieces, couple of shots in the car chase were nicely done using non traditional angles and view points. The actors were decent.  The problem is its too long, some fight scenes dragged on for too long also. The cuts to make it look like one seamless shot became more jarring as the film went on, early on it seemed much smoother, but it came to the point it hurt to watch."
카터,Carter,2022,1,,"Absolutely diabolical movie, unrealistic scenes and utter nonsense from start to finish, 2 hours of my life lost.  Only entertainment was the laughter from the poor awfulness of this 'Film'"
카터,Carter,2022,5,,"I was intrigued by the storyline & read some of the reviews first which seemed very polarized, so I decided to go ahead anyway. First off this movie heavily borrows elements from so many other movies that I'm not going to summarize the plot.  And that is the problem with this movie. Going from chapter to chapter in this movie, you would swear that you are watching the Matrix, Bourne Identity, Total Recall, Mission Impossible 2, Resident Evil, Old Boy cycled through repeatedly in various order. That is not necessarily a bad point if executed well but in this case, the storyline was too confusing to keep my interest.  The director overcompensated for the lack of storyline by giving the viewer over the top action in my opinion was way too excessive. To the point that it seemed repetitive & over done. Case in point the taxi cab chase scene & the train scene. Both scenes were chase scenes of the hero by various government agencies on motorcycles or trucks flanking the cab/train on both sides. Our hero is fighting the villains by jumping through the cab/train to the other side back & forth repeatedly.  The 2 scenes shot for shot were just too similarly done & too excessive to the point that I kept asking myself, didn't I see this before? Another scene was of our hero in the sauna. It was as if the director only wanted to outdo Old Boy by a factor of 3.  Yes it was well shot & executed but for me it was just too gratuitous. That by the end when the reveal came that tried to tie up all the loose ends, it never really does because its just more action to distract us from going wtf did I just watch to numb our brains cells even more with the over the top ending that borders on fantastical.  I like my movies to have a good storyline & plot with enough action balancing everything out. If you like movies with this in mind, then this isn't the movie for you...The Gray Man, anyone? If action is all you're after & plot is an afterthought, then this should fit the bill for you."
카터,Carter,2022,3,,"It appears that 90% of the budget was spent on four action scenes, all done with an outdated smartphone camera(this is not an exaggeration, the movie looks like it was done with a phone from 2010, any resent smartphone could record better than this). The director thinks that cinematotography is long drawn out overhead drone shots or extremely shaky cam to allow for the cheap effects to look better. And do not even talk about a story, plot, character development, logic, etc. It is a skip."
카터,Carter,2022,1,,"From what my experince i think this is one the failed one of action movie of korea from camera work and CGI.  Maybe this is became famous because the actor, and maybe many people want see him very badly but it doesnt mean this is a good movie  Im just laughing while watch the movie."
카터,Carter,2022,4,,Good premise good action Camera angle and handling ruins the entire film couldn't watch more than 15 min before getting really annoyed.if the camera doesnt bother you i suggest give it a try.
카터,Carter,2022,1,,"If I could give this film 0 out of ten I would, over 2 hours of my life I will never get back. Absolute drivel, who ever rated this film for Netflix needs their bumps feeling, please don't take my word just add a comment after wasting your precious time."
카터,Carter,2022,8,,"If the camerawork would have been smoother I would have given this a ten.  And I know that's hardly possible with the use of different cameras, while making it look like it's one shot, but this is a great leap into the future. Best action movie I have seen in a while. Please make more."
카터,Carter,2022,1,,"Lots of running and blood spray with the camera swooping around when it isn't pointing forward following the lead actor running, jumping and fighting, from the back. This isn't a movie. It's the Soldier of Fortune or Call of Duty video game with real men. Fans of YouTube channels that feature watching millionaire teens playing a video game will LOVE this 'movie'. The star kills thousands in a spray of blood, usually by cutting something off in almost every scene."
카터,Carter,2022,1,,"First start bathhouse fighting scene completely copy Deadpool2 and the rest of camera movement copy Crank1&2,so poor in plot of a play,no wander it's a korean movie."
카터,Carter,2022,2,,They open with a bathhouse fight sequence that makes Uma's bride vs. The 88 in Kill Bill look like high tea at The Plaza. But it's all downhill from there as too many ill-defined factions with even more obscure agendas use or pursue Carter (or whoever the Hell he is) through an international ordeal of controlling a zombie/superweaponizable virus and the hordes it's infected.  The whole experience is more exhausting to watch and try to understand than it's worth.
카터,Carter,2022,2,,"But 20 minutes in and I already found it utterly unwatchable. The story is convoluted and ridiculous, although that's not even the issue. The camera work is shaky, choppy, all over the place and either too rushed or can't keep with the action. The editing is just as bad with out of shot kills, lack of focus, obscured viewpoints and dizzying overhead drone shots. I'm all for single takes, but The Raid - a masterclass in Korean martial arts action - pulled it off perfectly with excitement and tension. This shlock fest doesn't even come close. Even the vehicle chase after the sauna scene is all over the place, using confined spaces to limit our viewpoint in a way which sucks any enjoyment out if what's actually happening on screen.  I gave up after this..."
카터,Carter,2022,3,,"And went completely downhill from there. The biggest selling point for Carter, the ""one-shot"" cinematography, becomes absolutely ridiculous. The first 20 or 30 minutes I was having a good time. A 50-man knife fight with everyone practically naked was brutal and completely over the top. Then the story takes over and it's not even worth talking about how bad it is. The idea is good but not the execution, and the painfully bad dialogue/acting will make your eyes roll constantly. One chase sequence after another ensues, and the one-shot cinematography stops trying to blend in at all. The edits are completely awful, with distractingly terrible CGI, first year film student zooms and action sequences that exhaust rather than entertain. Carter also has a runtime of over two hours, and I couldn't finish the last twenty minutes because the movie is a farce at that point. Carter is basically an ultra-violent poorly executed gimmick. A for effort but F for execution. I think if you go for something like the one-shot gimmick you should really nail it. Carter could have been a great time had it been filmed similarly to The Night Comes For Us, instead of nobody telling the director his one-shot idea was bad without adequate resources. Props to the stuntmen and women though. Three stars for their hard work."
카터,Carter,2022,1,,"Its been a while since I have watched international movies but I can't believe this miserable excuse is what passes off as action blockbuster overseas.  The movie stats off with your main character waking up in a motel and then all hell breaks loose. The action is nonstop, chaotic and unrealistic to the point where I was convinced that everything was taking place in some simulation that will be introduced later. Couple this with the director's constant infatuation with wide angle camera sweeps in a single shot, which frequently zooms out of the chaotic action to sweep the lay of the land which seems largely computer generated.  This movie must have been produced during the quarantine since most of the scenes take place in interior sections full of greenscreen CGI and the outdoors feel completely fake. Couple that with constant change in POV and no downtime after any action sequence makes it close to a vomit inducing rollecoaster ride off the rails. You have to be on meth or speed to actually catch up to this movie but its definitely not worth it as none it really pays off.  There is apparently a layered political espionage going on between North and South Korea but on top of that there are zombies. However, due to the terrible acting/dialogue and unrealistic action, the zombies don't really have any real presence beyond just cannon fodder for an action sequence which is the whole movie. There are hardly any downtime and most of is used for exposition dumps like a bad action game. This movie is definitely aimed at the local crowds as it does not explain the situation and constantly throws random names of people at you that most that are not familiar with Korean politics will be lost.  The worst offender is the camera. Transitioning between wide area sweeps and and continous single shot that does not compliment the action or the film in any way. Like a bad case of Tourette's the director can hardly wait five minutes before making a transition. The over use of contrast and color also adds to the unrealistic nature of the world where everything just feels fake. Its very hard to believe any of it is happening in a real world as none of it feels real at all.  Unless you are into heavy mind altering durgs/medication, this movie is hard to keep up with and its just not worth it to keep up. Whoever made this movie needs to go back to film school and start from scratch. This movie made the Grey Man look like a movie with an actual soul in comparison..."
카터,Carter,2022,8,,"Don't listen to all the very low ratings for this film, do as I did and watch the 1st 15 minutes and see for yourself if this style is for you.  It has the most unusual cinematography with a mixture of handicam and drone footage shot in like a single take (although it's not just made to look that way) which either you can appreciate or not.  The storyline is ok with a John Wick meets world war z tone, the action was non stop and really well done as long as you take into fact that it's a film and not realistic with inhuman abilities the main charactor has.  Just sit back and enjoy the frenetic action which fits with the camera work which makes you feel part of it. Make your own mind up and dismiss the naysayers. The ending leaves hope for a sequel which I would gladly watch."
카터,Carter,2022,5,,"I wanted to like it, but there was waaaay too much camera transitions, and they weren't very good transitions which made it seem cheaply shot............"
카터,Carter,2022,1,,"The subject of the movie was very stupid The filming of the movie was a disaster and left the audience dizzy The special effects were also a disaster The fires were like paintings The director was very fond of motorcycle action.  The director tried to imitate the action cinema of Hollywood, which worked very disastrously.  Finally, I can say that it was a movie that was not worth watching.

카터,Carter,2022,2,,"The what I suspect was supposed to be creative camera work confused me so often as to where I was; who I was; who and/or where I was l looking; who was looking at me and/or from where; random, gratuitous, non-sensible and non sequitur drone clips had me so confused and questioning, ""what the fuuuuuu...?"" ""Where the hu..?"" ""Is he going under the car?!"" ""How is he going out of the car?"" All of those meant-to-be-fancy but instead resulted in nonsensical cuts. What was probably thought to be cutting edge cameras work took me out of the moment, out of the scene, hell, out of the movie so often I inevitably frowned and simply lost interest. To hell with trying to get back in.  I worked so hard at trying to catch up, figure out what, figure out whom, figure out where...the eff are we going and why-I found myself just trying to simply get through and watching the ""minutes left"" timer. Not halfway through-and to get to that point was SUUUUCH a struggle-I gave up. I'm not even certain I understand the plot. Nor do I or even did I care if I do."
카터,Carter,2022,8,,"Totally overblown action scenes that defy all laws of physics, straight from the Fast and Furious school of filming. Rubbish green screens and CGI. A plot that was totally predictable, and I loved every ridiculous minute of it."
카터,Carter,2022,8,,"I generally don't go in for action movies. However, this one was a cut above the rest. The action sequences and special effects were truly exceptional, but almost too fantastical. But there was a human drive that seared all the way through, as the protagonist tries, and does, fulfill his mission, to finally include a reunion with his wife and daughter."
카터,Carter,2022,10,,Very insane movie with long action scenes. Ending is spectacular with non stop 30 minute scene. If you like creative camera angles and cool action this is for you.
카터,Carter,2022,8,,"Carter is an absolutely incredible action film brought down by laughable CGI, bad editing, a confused, barebones story, a ho-hum third act and divisive cinematography. And if all of that is enough to make it not worthwhile for you, that makes sense.  For me, though, the lower-budget, over the top charm of Carter, combined with the absolutely incredible action and fantastic lead made it more than worth my time, and hopefully yours. It's just certainly not for everyone."
카터,Carter,2022,9,,"It is quite unique. No annoying-unbearably-insufferable teenagers, no boring drama, no couples' repetitive arguments-wasted-time. Just a high-speed action package with top never seen before stunts and camera angles. Superbly filmed violence and gore in a cataclysmic bestial way of killing and dismembering. Nowadays there are few insane journeys like this one. Forget about the camera work, the scene with the little pigs broke my heart, focus on the moment, and enjoy the ride!"
카터,Carter,2022,10,,The story line..very good..joo won plqyingbgikd rolenhere..just the camera n too many action..quite annoying...really recommed to watch....quite understand since it budgeted movie.
카터,Carter,2022,10,,Omg wow amazing Carter in black dress and also from his hair style is looks like rama iku uwais.  And this movie action scenes is not less than from the raid Indonesian and the night comes for us.
카터,Carter,2022,8,,"This is the very definition of ""action packed"" and with the next generation of special effects and camerawork, it really puts hollywood to shame. There's enough of it to fill 10 action movies. Story on the other hand... eh, I didn't care much, typical guy who kills hundreds of bad guys and never dies no matter what, muh family, muh children, whatever. It does have some plot twists though and makes you wonder who's the bad guy and who's the good guy. Still better than hollywood."
카터,Carter,2022,8,,"This is a Korean take on ""Hardcore Henry"", plus shaky flycam, minus FPV. If you enjoyed ""Hardcore Henry"", you will definitely have a blast with this movie.  Word of caution though: violence is very graphic by Western standards."
카터,Carter,2022,9,,Great choreography and insane action with some of the best drone footage I've yet seen. The constant action without cut scenes is a fantastic method of filming.  Great action flic. Hope to see sequels...
카터,Carter,2022,10,,"Whole movie It's like ""splinter cell"" or ""hitman"" etc story scenes. I loved it it was like I was playing a game. I'm born 1985 but I'm sure older generations can't understand this type of movies or ones like hard-core henry."
카터,Carter,2022,10,,I loved every bit of this movie... nice action scenes and great storyline.  I think I was the first person to watch this as It was released In that instant.
카터,Carter,2022,10,,"If you are a fan of hardcore Asian action films, then you must watch this one. Right from the second, this Korean movie starts your blood will be pumping and your pulse will accelerate.  The action stunts and chasing sequences are so well crafted and perfectly timed that will surely keep you at the edge of your seat till the climax.  Joo Won plays the role of an amnesiac agent who lost his memory during a special secret mission and he perfectly suits this agent-oriented role. His non-stop stunts are so realistic and the direction so superb that I forgot to eat my popcorn.  This one is strictly for those who love and enjoy only action films, therefore keep your logic aside and enjoy its hardcore action scenes. You will surely love it."
카터,Carter,2022,9,,"This is the korean version of crank on crack mix with just cause, the sadness, world war z and the raid with hardcore henry tossed in. Some of the best camera work, and action and stunts i seen in a while. I hope we get a makin of i wanta see how this was all filmed. Will watch again for sure. And the end leaves more. This is what summer action is about. Thanks Korea.  They know how to make sick zombie movies that are different."
카터,Carter,2022,10,,"Some of the best action I have seen in years, with brilliant, breathtaking stunt work. A chase involving a train and helicopters. A chase involving not one but three cars with the protagonists jumping between them. Stunning work. Some of the story doesn't make sense - it's sci-fi sort of - but with such nonstop action, who cares?"
카터,Carter,2022,10,,"This movie have a lot of camera twist and turns which I enjoyed. This kept me engaged in the movie.  At first, I was slightly complaining about the angels but I TOTALLY APPRECIATE the director sense of keeping the audience engaged. I hope the director doesn't change this because I loved it' ultimately throughout the film.  I loved this very much! We need a PART 2 because the ending could a bit better - unless there will be a sequel 👀 but I enjoyed this movie for the most part. Took me through a journey through the sky, water, land, I felt like I was . BEST MOVIE I SEEN ON NETFLIX IN A WHILE. 10/10."
카터,Carter,2022,10,,"If you like raid , john wick and other movies with action from beginning to end, then this one's for you...i put this movie last in my list because if the lot of bad reviews and low rating..They all complained about the overuse of transitions, but that's what i liked the most..the movie is completely a single shot (several shots made in a way that it looks like a single shot).. Transitions are smooth and the shots are cut short to not make it boring..No unwanted scenes, only fight from start to end. First fight contains severe nudity, but after that the movie is full on lit...after reading reviews I thought the movie was illogical and somebody mentioned bad cgi...For me some scenes are illogical but even john wick has illogical scenes..who cares...few illogical scenes which defy physics..not a big deal..most of em are convincing...cgi is not the best and not the worst, its most of the times good and sometimes bad..just appreciate the way the movie is made.. In most of the scenes you'd feel like the vfx team and editors gave their most in this movie...i loved it .the story is somewhat clishe like bourne series but definitely a good one...i was not bored watching this..gave 10 stars to balance the rating...  Real rating 7.5/10."
카터,Carter,2022,10,,"Where have all these negative reviews come from?  Being a fan of all our action films such as John Wicks, The Raid and Shoot Em UP I was keen to watch Carter.  It exceeded all My expectations! It is the most bonkers, over the top and breathtaking film I have ever seen! The choreography is incredible and the action never stops from beginning to end.  It is full of set piece action scenes ranging from hand to hand fights to car chases and and an amazing sequence of a a gunfight while falling from a plane. By the end of the film I was utterly exhausted from the constant adrenaline rush  Please watch this amazing movie or you will regret it!"
카터,Carter,2022,8,,"Forget about the other lower rater, if you can enjoy Fast and Furious Saga, Matrix Saga, Harcore Henry then this is another movie to enjoy. Thrillblazing actionpacked with adrenaline rush all over.  But if u are romance k-drama lover, avoid this movie because u will never enjoy fast movie like this.  I enjoy the twist, the plot, the details, the cinematography, the adrenaline rush in ehich making me commenting here.  This movie simply you cannot expect the ending or what next and the action have been filmed which you never see even in tamil movie. For now it have scene genuinely only in this movie."
카터,Carter,2022,8,,"This is a pretty crazy film. Like others have said it is like Hardcore Harry. But also a lot like a lower budget Extraction where the camera, literally, goes everywhere and there appear to not be any cuts. It flies under buses between people, into mirrors and out, through car windows, falls down with actors as they jump out of buildings, etc. You can tell a lot of this was done with CGI which falls apart often, but then a lot was also done with drones and gimbals and is very impressive.  Some, no all, of the fight scenes are ridiculous. The opening one in a bath house reminded me of the hallway fight scene in the original Old Boy. Just a bunch of dudes with knives and axes trying to get one guy and failing.  I think if they had toned down some of the absurd events and focused on fewer or with less going on, then they could have done them better, but they wanted to go for broke on all, and the poor CGI shows through and it all wears thin as you grow tired of it.  Also, having watched the film I'm still unclear as to what the full plot was. Zombies, a N. Korean coup, a double agent, erased memories, and more and I'm not sure exactly what was happening, only that Carter - if that is who he really is - needs to bring a scientist daughter to N. Korea and it seems like almost everyone is trying to stop him.  It is good for a laugh as it is so absurd. Lots of cars and trucks running over unlucky bad guys. Lots of blood and head shots and motorcycle crashes. Check it out if you aren't up for anything to serious, but with plenty of action."
카터,Carter,2022,8,,"RATED 8/10 Language: Korean Source: Netflix RECOMMENDED  Good old story (world war Z) in the new bottle and bottle is real eye candy. Literally the movie is filled with action blocks. Real gory and superficial action blocks. One man fight with army of people. All the fights are more or less same, either with gun or knife.  What makes this movie and action more interesting is the camera work. The pseudo continuous shots and their angles adds very good flavour to this one. The unbelievable-illogical action becomes more entertaining with these camera angles.  Remove all your logical questioning and enjoy this mindless action flick. Good popcorn entertaining for the weekend."
카터,Carter,2022,8,,I found Carter on Netflix having no idea what I was in store for - constant action except for some wooden dialogue from the American actors (not too much) - story is confusing at best - but more than made up by the constant action. As a former film maker (see Shock Waves - which I produced and filmed) I was in awe of the action and camera work.  This is a unique piece of movie-making worth a watch for those into constant action and wild scenes - as long as you can tolerate the story. Don't expect to be able to follow the story (unless you speak Korean) - I gave it 8 stars for the exceptional movie making.
카터,Carter,2022,8,,"INSANE CINEMATOGRAPHY. Seriously if you are not impressed enough with the action scenes the cinematography is sure to convince you of this film. Not sure if any bad reviews aren't ""Big Hollywood"" generated out of jealousy and fear it will drive up expectations for new American Action films...All I cans ay is it definitely delivers on teha cation and the visuals and personally I was jto too bothered by the acting either. Maybe watching it in the original language can help any awkward English dubbing acting. Great, great visuals and hats off to the incredible lead for putting his absolute all into this film."
카터,Carter,2022,8,,"A greatly thrilling ride from start to finish. This Joo Won led Korean action flick kicks off the action from the very first scene and does not stop. Amazingly good with the whole one long take sequencing and the way in which it was put together was really great but sadly some of the editing was a bit lacking, including some scenes with close ups of fire (with the fire really not looking realistic but showing to be a simple overlay). Minus that, it really gives the feel of a John Wick meets video game playthrough with cutscenes kind of vibe and keeps you on your seat from start to finish. Apologies to those who got headaches but I guess I am certainly on the other end of the spectrum with this one!!"
카터,Carter,2022,10,,"This is an amazing film, and for once it's not a pathetic superhero Disney film, I loved it. From the first minute to the last minute of the film it's action after action. Yes the editor must have had a headache editing the film but it's a unique beautifully made film. I really loved it, yes it had ""mistakes"" here and there but overall it's a great fictional film."
카터,Carter,2022,10,,"Action sequences are game like The way they used cameras everywhere, the zoom in and zoom on to other things are really good.  Congratulations to director and actor for creating this good film  Very thrilling edge of seat experience film I have recently The hard work of every person worked with film should be appreciated.  The Action sequence in city or rural is picture perfect Unexpected turn of events make this a great film."
카터,Carter,2022,8,,"So my reviews are going to attempt to break down the levels a movie gives so you can better determine your engagement. With this movie I see a roller coaster of reviews because they expect ""this"" but get ""this"" and not everyone watches with those expectations. So here we go... 10 being best, 1 being worst  ACTION LEVEL-(9) Why? Because the action is submersive. Todays action movies need to be in, around and over the protagonist to connect the engagement with the fans. This is exactly what this movie does. It follows the protagonist(CARTER) through every iteration and decision that will effect his outcome. There is camera wizardry, crazy camera edits, zooms and footage breaks that make you say ""how did they come up with that"". It's done in a way that does keep you looking at the screen. Why it can't be perfect is because you can visibly see CGI effects not up to par with what we expect this type of movie action promotes. But there few and far between and I wasn't expecting Marvel Universe level effects.  STORY LINE-(4) Why? Because this story has been told over and over again. They just did a Korean version of it. There plot holes and continuity errors in spots than make you say to yourself, ""huh"". Quite frankly, if your looking for this movie to make you cry or feel connected to the world, this isn't is purpose. It's literally just in your face action with a quick storyline because the goal is to put crazy action in your face!  ADHD Engagement-(8) This section basically measures: Will you surf on your phone while the movie is playing. YES!! Because your so familiar with the story line, and because the story line is not strong, parts become predictable to the point you will surf your phone as your watching. Heck, I didn't even finish it in one sitting, I stopped one day because my phone surfing had me missing to much of the movie.  FINAL-If your looking for a cool action movie to watch without the need of deep level connection, this is it! If you plan on doing other things while you watch it, this is it. If your looking for a deep connection and top tier story line, this not it, but watch anyway because the algorithm will keep shoving it in your face so just get it over with.  Thanks for your time and see you on the next review!!!"
카터,Carter,2022,9,,"Yes pun intended I guess - I mean it is the director of Memories of Murder. An amazing movie to say the least. That being said, you may not feel the same about the movie at hand here. At least when it comes to the story. And that is a fair point to make. But when it comes to the technological impact .. the way it was shot? I mean if you don't see this as quite the tall order ... see this as something amazing they accomplished ... I don't know what to say to you.  It has some nudity, but it has even more blood and violence. It is like that Old Boy scene (or Ong Bak or whatever else you may think of) ... but taken to a hundred or more. And all done in one shot? Of course - or rather I can only assume, but I think the movie does have some ""secret"" cuts. But so well edited ... so well done, that you can't really tell where.  Korean cinema is really good - you have come to that conclusion by yourself I hope and assume since you are here. And this movie is not that different ... I imagine the rating will go up ... it is way too low at the moment (this deserves at least a 7 technically speaking). But it also is quite exhausting to watch ... there is so much action ... and while it does take a breather or two ... it also is quite non stop when it starts going for it. Also the one shot thing can wear thin at times ... but again it always works.  What may not work is how convenient things can be - from locations to how our main character is being treated and how the people out to get him, seem to not coordinate as well to do just that ... it is almost and bear with me, as if it all was choreographed ... I know, shocker! Kidding and pun aside, just suspend your disbelief and go with the flow."
카터,Carter,2022,10,,"Really 5.1?  First 30 minutes alone was out of this world .. car chasing scene , shooting on the air .. OMG .. this mobil will become a classic ..  ive never seen any movie like this one, beautifully done and the camera is super crazy .. be sure to watch this one .. thank you for making me believe in movies again .."
카터,Carter,2022,8,,"While CARTER isn't as good as THE VILLAINESS, it's certainly a distinctive slice of first person action from South Korea, very much their version of HARDCORE HENRY - although not on the same level. The film has some huge flaws, with long and dull scenes of exposition pushing the storyline up to nearly two and a half hours, and they should have excised all that to focus on the action. Because the action is where this film hits, and it's generally good: creative drone shooting during vehicle chases, great hand to hand bouts. A lot of it is CGI-based and it never quite recaptures the highs of the early bath house scene, but overall this is a fun little flick that delivers the goods."
카터,Carter,2022,8,,"A very well deserved 8 or even 9 out of 10 for me. One of the best action movies i've seen in years. Its a bit over the top here and there and usually im not into that but it didnt bother me at all. Gave me a bit of a 'mission impossible' feel but like a lot better than that. I suppose its all a personal opinion but i would surely recommend it to anyone who likes to watch asian films and/or action movies. The description says 'fast paced', thats 100% true, the locations are also very beautiful and change more than enough. It goes from rooms to trains, to mountains. U name it, this movie got it! Very well done!"
카터,Carter,2022,8,,"Non stop action. Hollywood has some serious things to pick up here. Camerawork was impressive. Explotions and other things was bad. Action scenes was new and refreshing, but lack some cred. I think SC could be better than hollywood, and may be they are already. I'm tired of that US way of making movies  I think this movie is a gamechanger for action movies. I've not seen any better for the last 10 years or so... well if you can ignore some things."
카터,Carter,2022,10,,"Korean movie industry has put Hollywood in it's back pocket. Korean drama movies, tv series have put Hollywood to shame on Human Interest stories. Hollywood's obsession on capes, flying people, wearing underwear outside, human birds, green giants, red amour, bows and arrows, huge hammers etc has totally lost their thread on what REALLY makes a movie great. Just out to Netflix and feast your eyes on their KD, action movies.  We are familiar with the KD fantastic shows, just when you think, well Korean movie companies are good only for rom-com, tear jerkers, comedy etc, they cannot match Hollywood's action movies, they cannot match matrix, fast and furious, jason bourne, James Bond, along comes Carter to change your mind.  OMG,, what can I say, this is one action movie to end all action movies. This is the gold standard for the whole world to compare. This Director is so good, he's a demi-god. He is obssessed with that one moving take, how does he do that? He takes a shot, and without a breakaway, he moves the camera, under cars, through windows, under tables, from one speeding car to another, ALL IN ONE take. Check it out and see what I mean. How? Korean CG is out of this world.  Non stop adrenaline rush. Non stop heart thumping action. So So good."
카터,Carter,2022,8,,"I love watching the various movie recap channels on YouTube as I have stated many times previously because they often review movies that I might have never watched or just overlooked. One such movie is Carter which made in2022 and written and directed by Jung Byung-gil. If you want action, this movie has it. If you want a high body count, this movie has it. If you like car chases or explosions, this movie has plenty of those. It's not even necessary to go over the plot of this movie because many people have already talked about it. This guy wakes up with no memories, soon an explosion kills a room full of agents and then the mayhem ensues.  Along the way the action is interrupted a storyline about a virus, something about North and South Korea, with the US tossed in to boot. But who really cares about all that jibber jabber. It s all about the action and the continuous camera shoots. This movie was over the top in everything it did which I love because either you really loved it, or really hated it as most of these reviews indicate. Put me in the really loved it camp.."
카터,Carter,2022,10,,"Once again, the Korean filmmakers have thrown down the gauntlet - making action sequences an art form - inventive, unbelievable, incredible - it leaves Hollywood action films in the shade - plodding and predictable- only Wick comes close to this high octane violent action. It was the visual equivalent of the best ride in a Theme Park. The photography and direction blended each set piece into the other with seamless ease. Yet unlike US Blockbusters the action leaves you breathless as opposed to bored or listless. Warning! After watching Carter you may need a lie down or find your old BMX to race down a steep hill..!"
카터,Carter,2022,9,,"Uniquely amazing cinematography like nobody's business. Intensely brutal, the over-the-top non-stop action is so wildly fierce and gory that the screenplay indeed runs like an action/adventure video game mixed with cartoonish invulnerability on the part of the protagonist, who conveniently picks up limitless weapons including pistols with 50-round magazine capacity. The massacre of a limitless number of rabid attacking enemies including a plague of zombies and hoards of suicide soldiers occurs over a variety of venues, starting with a bath house where the protagonist wears nothing but a thong. The death count is in the hundreds before he finally puts some pants on. Then it continues in the mountains, in the desert, with jeeps, motorcycles, helicopters and trains with plenty of mid-air action, slow-motion effects and long takes of hyperintensity that it quickly becomes farcical, but wow, what a show. The ending is a blast."
카터,Carter,2022,10,,"This is criminally under rated! I never write any review but this injustice to the effort of the actors is insane  I want to see the making of this and the practice and care needed to decide and execute the amazing fighting sequences  The story is captivating, has good potential as it is creative. A little more room to explore n tie in the story pieces help us to identify more with the dilemma Carter was in, and we can treasure more with a clear mind , as can be dizzy for viewers, we can see clearly the beautiful action sequence as they pull in.  I wish this can be a new era action classic, i have never seen action film that spectacular before, use the good suspense of the storyline to make the action mlre sexy and appealing and inevitable deployment of such survival actions.  I am truly astonished by Joo Won to have such a beast side. The stunts are 180 out of 100 marks! He is a very good actor that not get fully used here, by his stunts here is unforgetable."
카터,Carter,2022,8,,"I can understand all the criticism of certain average special effects or the headache that frenetic images can cause the viewer. However, to stop at these considerations could mean missing out on some of the most incredible action scenes ever filmed in a uniquely modern style. At times, it feels more like you're watching a director's demo reel than a real, structured film, but if you like outrageous sequences in the Hardcore Henry style and can turn a blind eye to certain undeniable flaws, don't miss Carter! It's an almost endless succession of crescendoing bravura sequences, without much brains but ultra spectacular. My rating is a little inflated to compensate for the really low rankings, even if some of the film's scenes totally deserve it."
카터,Carter,2022,9,,"Directing style is a beast! Movie is a must see if your into action movies. Dang it, first time leaving a review to make folks aware of this movie and they want 150 characters. I'm short and to the point. I'm not a writer and this will be the last time I leave a review."
카터,Carter,2022,10,,"Watch it in the original Korean language. Loved the premise of the story with a brilliant start in a bedroom and jimjilbang (onsen) and non-stop adrenaline pumping chase scenes. Appreciated the story of a reunification of both north and south Korea, the suspicions, the mysterious voice in the head and interference by the US & CIA set in a zombie-like viral infection. What's not to like?"
카터,Carter,2022,9,,"Here is my spoiler free review of Carter!  Now the other reviews say the CGI isn't the best with cheap green screen scenes but i could barley even notice them, plus take a look at all of the other action scenes they are incredible! This films story is a bit confusing and not the best, but it keeps you entertained the whole way through! We go from jumping out of buildings, skydiving, fighting on motorcycles, hanging from helicopters, running on top of trains and more, and i was always just like ""how the hell did we end up here all in one take?!"" Hahaha. This is such a blast to watch with family as it has tons and tons of action!"
카터,Carter,2022,10,,"If you are looking for something new and all time best awesome movie then go without hesitation. An amazing movie with lots and lots of action and don't get me started about the camera control. Don't see the rating, do yourself a favor and just go watch this one right now."
카터,Carter,2022,10,,The way each action scene is shot is incredible. The way the camera moves its like a single story video game. Its great.  The plot is ok but the action is 95% of the movie and each action scene is filmed perfectly.  Amazing camera work as well.  Gray man is nothing in front of this.
카터,Carter,2022,10,,Forget Some Logics... Great Action from Start to End... Really insane stunts.... Great Camera Work... It is the best Action Entertainer for this year... Films like this comes very Rare... I personally loved it... I don't know what's wrong with negative reviews... it's a pure action...
카터,Carter,2022,8,,"Not for kids. This is closer to a parody of Mission Impossible films than to a serious action film. This is a: gifted director, gifted stunt crew, gifted drone pilot cameraman, and gifted green screen VFX compositors ...... riffing on and improvising on the theme of ONE SHOT ACTION TAKES. NO MORE NOR LESS. For this reason the film will be of more interest to filmmakers and fans of how films are made, not so much to action film fans.  The same thing happened with Hardcore Henry. If you liked the bus fight scene in Marvel's Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings--this is an entire film of similar action with cars, motorcycles, zip lines, trains, helicopters, you name it.  Better than Hardcore Henry (2015)! This is not a movie in the usual sense. All complaints about the plot are irrelevant. I found it possible to ignore the few scenes especially at the beginning in poor taste. Be warned the body count is in the hundreds but all the blood has been put in in post, just like John Wick. Both Henry and Carter take video-game gun and fighting violence to 11 in a succession of stunt team fantasies. It's often mayhem.  The plot and characters are negligible; yet, way better than Henry. The lead, Joo Won, is especially deeply invested in his character and therefore very watchable.  This is by far the best drone camerawork I can recall seeing. Never done better in my experience."
카터,Carter,2022,9,,"The action sequences in this are epic. Old boy, eat yer heart out, forget the Japanese. The action sequences are epic. Hollywood take note. The action sequences are epic... on the story has its moments where you're kinda like, oh common that ain't gonna happen, but regardless of the 'ever' moments, the action sequences in this movie are Ep-ic!!!!"
카터,Carter,2022,10,,"I love this movie. I've re-watched it probably 5 times bc it's so insane I see new things each viewing. The art is in the cinematography. I've never quite seen anything like it and I appreciate it's originality. The hero in all his brutality has a heart and I'm a sucker for good guy bad guy stuff. The main character, Carter, I could see being in this action hero role for the next 30 years. The Korean Scott Adkins as a comparison.  I haven't read the other reviews yet but I'm just so surprised it isn't rated significantly higher. If I had to define what a modern action movie is this is exactly the film I'd say defines it."
